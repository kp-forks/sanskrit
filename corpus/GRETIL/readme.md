This directory contains reformatted versions of [GRETIL](https://gretil.sub.uni-goettingen.de/gretil.html) files, based on their plain text versions provided by Maximilian Mehner. This collection is being created as part of the NCCR [Evolving Language](https://evolvinglanguage.ch/), “Meaning change” project.


The plain text GRETIL files contain several features that hinder automatic processing. These features include scholarly notes and remarks interspersed with the Sanskrit text, pāda breaks in metrical texts marked by line breaks, use of apostrophs for avagrahas and quotations, and, most importantly, the mixing of mūla text and commentaries in many important śāstra texts, which makes diachronic linguistic studies difficult.


The GRETIL files presented here address some of these issues through manual reformatting. Currently, slightly less than half of the files have been reformatted. Individual files may contain details about this process in their `#Notes:` header field.

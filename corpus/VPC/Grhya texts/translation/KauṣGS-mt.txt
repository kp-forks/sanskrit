The preceptor and the father, both, and a friend who is not a guest in the house, whatever they decide, that should be done. This is prescribed as Dharma. A brahmin should not go away from a guest who is a fellow-villager or who has come unexpectedly. One should know that a house where the wife is present, or even the fires, is present. There is no fasting while one is away. The wife observes the vow. The son, brother, disciple, or wife should offer the oblation. The Agnihotra, the cattle, and the guest who has come at the right time, and the children and the elders of the family, when insulted, burn everything. The gods and the Pitrs always go to the householder. The guest also comes for his share and deserves to be offered. When a brahmin goes away without being honoured, he takes away all the good deeds of one who is grinding stones, and offering Agnihotra. From the water-pot, or even from the wood, the Brahma-yajna is prescribed from the Sūkta or the Anuvāka. Those for whom these five great sacrifices are performed regularly, he is liberated from all sins and is honoured in the heaven of heaven. Those who perform this Vaiśvadeva rite in the evening and morning, they would prosper with their purpose, life, fame, and progeny.

3.10.26	One should not eat without offering to the ancestors.
3.10.27	One should not eat alone.
3.10.28	One should eat before others.
3.10.29	This is also said by the sage:

3.10.31	If any of the six kinds of fees is offered, one should perform the one that is considered the most common, such as the goat or sheep.
3.10.32	To the teacher, the Agniya; to the officiating priest, the Barhaspatya; to the one who has performed the marriage, the Prajapatya; to the king, the Indra; to the beloved, the Maitra; to the one with a shaven head, the Indra-Agni.
3.10.33	If one performs a Soma sacrifice several times during the year, they should perform it for one who has already been offered the fees.
3.10.34	Those who have not been honoured with Arghya.

3.11.16	One should not laugh.
3.11.17	One should run.
3.11.18	One should spit.

3.11.43	One should eat what is left over by one's father, deities, guests, and servants.
3.10.35	That is also done at the Soma-sacrifice and at the rites for the Pitrs and the gods. Manu has said that animals should be killed here only, not elsewhere. The preceptor and the father, both, and a friend who is not a guest in the house, whatever they decide, that should be done. This is prescribed as Dharma. A brahmin should not go away from a guest who is a fellow-villager or who has come unexpectedly. One should know that a house where the wife is present, or even the fires, is present. There is no fasting while one is away. The wife observes the vow. The son, brother, disciple, or wife should offer the oblation. The Agnihotra, the cattle, and the guest who has come at the right time, and the children and the elders of the family, when insulted, burn everything. The gods and the Pitrs always go to the householder. The guest also comes for his share and deserves to be offered. When a brahmin goes away without being honoured, he takes away all the good deeds of one who is grinding stones, and offering Agnihotra. From the water-pot, or even from the wood, the Brahma-yajna is prescribed from the Sūkta or the Anuvāka. Those for whom these five great sacrifices are performed regularly, he is liberated from all sins and is honoured in the heaven of heaven. Those who perform this Vaiśvadeva rite in the evening and morning, they would prosper with their purpose, life, fame, and progeny.

3.11.24	One should avoid facing the rear.
3.11.25	One should be on a raised platform.
3.12.21	There is nothing that he does not attain.
3.12.22	There is no return for him.
3.12.23	The word Veda applies to both the Veda and the Brahmanas.
3.12.24	For the Veda is the root of Dharma.
3.12.25	And Brahma is not to be stolen by thieves.
3.12.26	And each verse, when properly studied, becomes a wish-yielding cow.

3.12.32	The sage also said this:

He then offers oblations to Brahmanas. At the first union, the Brahmana should touch the plough and recite the verse "May our crops be abundant." The owner of the field should recite the following verse: "Obeisance to the lord of the field."
3.15.3	Then of the Svishtakrit, in which Vaivasvata Yama, all the gods are assembled, the Ashtka is all-facing, she satisfied me with my desires. The stones say: "Your teeth are the udder, Pavamana is the half-months and months, the limbs are the organs. Obeisance to you, O one with a smiling face, svāhā!"
3.13.12-15	Having performed the rite of sprinkling water, he performs the rite of benediction. Having sprinkled water, he offers three handfuls of water into the water.

Having bathed with a paste of cow-dung and mustard, and wearing a new, white, unwashed garment, he should fill a new pot with flowing water, reciting "Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Svaḥ." Or with other water, he should offer cow-dung, mustard, Dūrvā grass, barley, and wheat. And he should offer incense and flowers according to his means. Having offered a pot of cooked rice to Agni, he should offer oblations with the Sāvitrīs, starting from one thousand and going up to twelve thousand, according to his ability.
3.15.3	Then of the Svishtakrit, in which Vaivasvata Yama, all the gods are assembled, the Ashtka is all-facing, she satisfied me with my desires. The stones say: "Your teeth are the udder, Pavamana is the half-months and months, the limbs are the organs. Obeisance to you, O one with a smiling face, svāhā!"
4.1.2	Or until the cessation of faults.
4.1.3	Having sat facing east on the eastern side of the fire, facing east, one should sprinkle oneself with the three verses beginning with "Apohiṣṭhīyā".
4.1.4	Having adorned oneself with white (clothes), having recited the great Vyāhrtis, Sāvitrī, and the Svāsthyanas, one is freed from all sins, diseases, and fears.

Having run four times, he should offer the oblation: "O Jataveda, carry the oblation to the fathers, where you know them in the world of the righteous. The streams of fat flow down, may the desires of the sacrificer be true, svāhā." With four great oblations, and four times "Those who are thirsthy," he offers eight oblations, a cooked rice dish mixed with curds.
4.1.5	If the patient is sick, or if the father, brother, teacher, son, or disciple is unable to do so, then any one of them may perform the rite.
4.1.6	He recites three verses: "I release you for life with oblations," "May there be well-being for those who go forth," and "May there be good fortune for those who go."
4.1.7	The gift is optional.
4.1.8	Thus having offered oblations to Rudra in the middle of the cowshed with the Raudra Sūktas, one worships the fire.
4.1.9	One should recite the Savitri mantra an unlimited number of times with the Sampata verses and the Souma Shri verses, or sprinkle three times clockwise with the Vetasa branches and the Kusha handfuls. The worship with the cow verses is said to be the remedy for all diseases.
4.1.10	Now comes the feeding of Brahmins.
3.15.5	The mountains have disappeared, the earth has disappeared, the day and all the directions have disappeared. He has hidden himself from the fathers, to him, svāhā! The seasons have disappeared, the day-and-night, the half-months and months, the joints have disappeared. To you, O Sumana-faced, svāhā. Those who stand, those who flow, those who are around with water, those who are the lords of all with water, he has hidden himself from them, to him, to the father, svāhā, Whatever my mother has seduced, wandering without a husband, that seed may her father destroy. They say another has fallen. To him, svāha. Thus, in place of the great formulas, there are four others for the purpose of exclusion.

May you be pleased with me, O you who have a smiling face! Svāhā! The Svishtakṛt is common to all.
3.15.7	On the day after the Anvaṣṭaka, he should offer the Pinda-paternal sacrifice, or he should offer the Gopaśu-sacrifice, or he should bring a cow, or he should burn a cow, saying, "This is my Aṣṭaka."
3.15.8	But he should not do it, but he should not do.
4.2.3	The lord of the divine serpents may be invoked, the divine serpents may invoke, he pours water, saying, "The lord of the divine snakes may draw (the line), the divine snakes may be drawing (the line)." He encircles with the hood, saying, "May the lord of the divine serpent snakes anoint, may the divine serpent snakes be anointing."

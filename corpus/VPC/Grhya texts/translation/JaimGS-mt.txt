2.9.2	The gods lead the man who does not believe, who is impure, who does not recite the Vedic hymns, who has abandoned auspicious rites, to Yama's abode. I shall describe the hospitality to the gods, whose movements are bright, who travel in the path of the stars, and which should be performed in the rites for peace. The Sun and Mars are red, Mercury and the Moon are white, Mercury is the son of the Moon, and Jupiter is also yellow. Know that Saturn is black, and Rahu and Ketu are also so. The wise one should offer flowers of the colors of the planets. Having smeared a mound of cow dung the size of a cowhide, sprinkled it, drawn the characteristics, sprinkled it with water, and arranged the fire, having offered the two oblations of ghee, they invoke the planets. The Sun in the middle, Mars in the southeast, the Moon in the northeast, Mercury in the north, Jupiter in the east, Venus in the west, Saturn in the southwest, Rahu in the northwest, and Ketu in the west. The Sun is known as the Lord, the Moon as Uma, Mars as Skanda, Mercury as Narayana, Jupiter as Brahma himself, Venus as Indra, Saturn as Yama, Rahu as the messenger of time, and Ketu as Citragupta. These are the divine planets.

2.8.19	Having studied the twelve Samhitās, whatever he has studied in the absence of study, whatever he has angered his teachers, whatever wrong deeds he has done, he purifies by them.
2.8.20	His pure and purified Brahman becomes.

2.8.25	For six months he eats only barley, for four months only barley-gruel, for two months only fruits, for one month only water, and for twelve nights he fasts. He soon disappears.
2.8.26	He purifies his relatives.
2.8.27	He saves seven ancestors, seven descendants, and himself, making fifteen.
2.8.28	This is called the path to heaven.
2.9.7	With these (offerings) he offers to the cooked Agni. To Aditya, rice-gruel as oblation; to Angaraka, rice-gruels cooked with ghee; to Soma, rice-gruell cooked with milk; to Brihaspati, rice-gruells cooked with milk; rice-gruells mixed with curds to Shukra; rice-gruell mixed with sesamum and pulse to Budha; rice-gruel cooked with meat to Rahu; rice-gruels of various kinds to Ketu.
2.8.29	By this very (rite) the gods attained divinity, the sages sagehood.
2.8.30	Now, of this Brahma-sacrifice, there are three kinds of commencement, namely, at the morning-pressing, at the midday-pressing, or at the Brahma-time in the last part of the night.
2.8.31	Now, in this (Brahma-sacrifice) there are only two occasions for not studying, namely, when one's body is impure, or when the place (where one is) is impure.
2.8.32	That Prajapati told the seven sages, the seven sages told Mahājahnu, and Mahājahnu told the Brahmins.

2.9.24	The elephant of Ketu.
2.9.25	Gold for all.
2.9.26	Or whatever pleases the teacher, that he gives.
2.9.27	As a machine that has been set in motion is stopped by another machine, so is the terrible affliction of those touched by the planets stopped. One should not instruct one who is devoted to austerities, one who has resorted to heaven, one who is the destroyer of gods, a brahmin, a woman at the end of her menstrual period, or one who is surrounded. To one who is non-violent, self-controlled, whose wealth is acquired through dharma, and who is always engaged in rituals, the planets are always benevolent. The planets, cows, kings, and brahmins, especially, when worshipped, worship in return; when slighted, they burn.
2.9.2	The gods lead the man who does not believe, who is impure, who does not recite the Vedic hymns, who has abandoned auspicious rites, to Yama's abode.

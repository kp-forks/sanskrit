He, the knower of all, the one to be praised in all the rites, O Indra, the bountiful, thou hast given to the pressing (Soma) the Parāvata (bird) which was brought together by many, to the Sharabha, the friend of the Rṣis.

2.4.8.6	May the birds come quickly, the crows who eat oblations.
2.4.6.5	"The waters are firm, the waters are bountiful."

2.4.8.12	In the middle, for the attainment of all goals." So it is said.
2.4.8.13	Having thus known, one should undertake all actions. One should undertake all actions."
2.4.9.1	Now we shall explain the procedure of wearing the sacred thread.
2.4.6.14	Then, having placed the remnant of the oblation on a bundle of Darbha grass in front of the fire, he recites the verse, "May this Agni, the most excellent, bestow life on you from all sides. Agni, the giver of life," with two verses. Then, having placed gold in the remaining ghee, he offers with the four verses, "For you to Indra, the brilliant one, the brilliant one," and with half-verses in the Anucchada metre. He shows the shadow in the remaining ghee.
2.4.9.2	In the bright fortnight, on an auspicious day, a Brahmin girl or a Brahmin widow, having washed her hands and feet well, pure, wearing white, not wet clothes, having gone to where cotton is, taking a ripe fruit, having smeared a cow-dung-sized square altar with cow dung, having installed the yantra in its center, sitting facing east or north, having tied the thread layer by layer, never makes it low.
2.4.9.3	He gives to a brahmin.
2.4.6.15	"O Agni, make me long-lived and radiant." With this he gives to the Brahman.
2.4.6.16	"You are life, you are all life, you are the entire life, you are life from which comes the strength of mind." With these four Anucchada verses, he recites the benediction with the Anubrahmanas.
2.4.6.17	Having fed the Brahmanas with food prepared from three kinds of grains, having made them recite benedictory verses, he says, "May the Brahmanas be pleased."
2.4.6.18	Then he circumambulates the village of Ashamaya.
2.4.6.19	Then he carries it with special coverings, attendants, whisks, and palm-leaf fans.
2.4.9.4	Then the Brāhmaṇa, having bought gold, or grain, or wealth, with well-washed hands and feet, having sipped water, with pure hands, facing east or north, having sat down, counting with the fingers of his right hand, joined together, ninety-six times, and having multiplied it by three, he then cleanses it with water, with the three verses, "The waters are the best, the waters are the most bountiful," and with the four verses, "The golden-colored ones, the pure ones, the purifying ones," and with this Anuvāka, "Pavamāna is the golden one."
2.4.9.5	Having invited the Brahmanas, one stands facing east, two stand facing west, and having made a thread of the right hand with the formula "Bhūr Bhuvah Svah," he makes it three-fold and releases it on the sacrificial tree.
2.4.9.6	He strikes with grass.
2.4.6.20	Then, having placed the chariot and the vehicle in the chariot, along with the sounds of conch shells and singing, one should recite the Svasti Sūkta, beginning with "May Svasti protect us" and ending with "May there be no fear for us in narrow places."
2.4.6.21	Then one offers oblations at the door.
2.4.6.22	Then, having gone inside the house, having worshipped the Brahmins and having recited the blessings, one tells the children.
2.4.9.7	Taking the thread in his hand, he encircles it with his knees. "May Prajapati settle you with that deity, firm like Angiras. " Then the second: "May Prajapati, with that deity, settle you firm like Angiras." "Then the third: "May Prajapatis settle you with that divinity, firm like Angira." "Then, having made a knot, "May Prajapatis settle you with that divine Angiras."
2.4.6.23	The Blessed One Agniveshya says that one who has performed the rite of Tarapana attains union with the moon and becomes equal to the moon in radiance, and attains union with the gods and becomes equal to them in radiance, and becomes equal to his sons and grandsons in radiance, and lives for a thousand years, and displays the young moon, and attains union and the same world with his sons and grandsons.
2.4.7.1	Now, if a Brahmin has committed the great sins and other sinful acts, what should his co-parceners do?
2.4.9.8	Then one becomes one who wears the sacrificial thread, saying, "I wear the sacrificial thread for long life, for good offspring, for good strength, for lordship over all the Vedas, for prosperity, for fame, for Brahman, for brahminical splendor."
2.4.9.9	Having sipped water, one becomes fit for all rites. One becomes fit for all the rites.
2.4.10.1	Now we shall explain the propitiation of the deities.
2.4.7.2	On the censured day, in the evening, the Sapiṇḍas remain together.
2.4.7.3	A smear of cow dung should be done at the crossroads, and a pot of water should be placed for the censured cold and heat.
2.4.7.4	The slave girl then fills the pot with water, and the Sapiṇḍa-s, rising up, spoke these words:
2.4.7.5	From now on, he should not speak, travel, sit in assemblies, lie down, or eat with her.
2.4.7.6	Having spoken thus, he should circumambulate the pot and strike it with the heel of his left foot in its presence.
2.4.10.2	Having covered the pure, white, and dry (cloth) with a sacred hand, having worshipped the twilight after entering (the temple), having performed the fire rites, one should invoke the deity.
2.4.10.3	In the mandala, on the ground, in water, in the blazing fire, and also in the image, having invoked Hari, one should worship. The wise one should mentally visualize a lotus inside the heart.
2.4.7.7	All of them, without looking back, went to the place as described and performed the various expiations as prescribed in the scriptures.
2.4.7.8	Thus purified, he then bathed in a pure water body, recited the auspicious verses, and entered the crossroads.
2.4.10.4	In the center of the lotus, the light is established. In the center of that light, Mahāviṣṇu holds a conch, a disc, and a mace.
2.4.10.5	Thus, having invoked with the twelve names, one should say "To Keśava".
2.4.10.6	Then one should worship with sandalwood, etc., and lamps. In the maṇḍala, and in the mound, and in the same way, and in the blazing fire, having invoked Hari, one should worship.
2.4.7.9	Having smeared with cow-dung, one should install a new pot, filled with water from a well, and worship the kinsmen.
2.4.7.10	Having performed the auspicious benediction, one should circumambulate the pot, drink the water from the pot, and then enter one's own house.
2.4.7.11	Having fed the Brahmins, one should feed them along with the kinsmen.
2.4.7.12	Thus having made the pure-souled one recite the blessings of his father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, and the elders of his family, he should then perform all the rites.
2.4.8.1	Now we shall explain the rite of offering oblations to crows, which are auspicious and inauspicious omens.
2.4.8.2	Having gone out of the village towards the east or north, having smeared with cowdung a square piece of cowhide the size of a cowhide, having sprinkled it, having drawn the characteristic lines, having sprinkled it with water, he arranges the seat of the crows in a clockwise direction.
2.4.10.8	Then, having invoked the deity with the names of Keshava and others, he offers clothes with the verse "You two offer clothes." Then, having offered incense with the verse "The gateway of fragrance," he offers flowers with the verse "He who knows the flower of water." Then, having presented incense with the verse, "You are incense," he offers a lamp with the verse, "Light up!" He applies unguents with the remaining part.
2.4.10.9	The water for the feet is called argha. The water for sipping is called ācamanīya.
2.4.10.10	Then he cooks the rice.
2.4.10.11	He cooks it with a prastha measure of ghee or milk.
2.4.10.12	Then the food is prepared.
2.4.8.3	I offer to the birds of the Ankata species, I offer to the Kankata species, I offer the Kadru sons, I offer to those who live in trees, I offer to Brahma's sons.
2.4.8.4	Then he invites them thus:
2.4.8.5	Not the tawny ones, not the cuckoos, not the bad omens, not the great bad omens, but only the crows.
2.4.8.6	May the birds come quickly, the crows who eat oblations.
2.4.10.13	Having given the truth, he sprinkles with the verse, "I sprinkle you with truth and righteousness." He sprinkles.
2.4.10.14	Then, touching the food, with the verse, “I am the first-born of truth,” he performs the spreading with the verse, "You are the spreading of immortality."
2.4.10.15	Then the offering to Prāṇa.
2.4.8.7	I invoke the crows, I invoke the ravens, I invoke the sons of Kadru, I invoke the crows. I invoke the sons born of Brahma. Having invoked thus, he should offer water with the three verses beginning with "The waters are firm, the bountiful ones..." and the four verses beginning with "Golden-coloured, pure, shining..." and the Anuvaka beginning with "Pavamana, the giver of gold..." Having purified himself with this Anuvaka, he should worship with incense, flowers, and lamps, saying "Salutations to him, salutations to him..." and offer oblations with the verses "To him svāhā, to him svāhā..." He should offer the ball of rice clockwise, saying "To him svadhā, to him svadhā..."
2.4.8.8	"Having stood up, saying, 'Salutations to him, salutations to him,' they say, 'The truths stand, speak the truth, the crows delight in truth. Let him here speak the truth, not eat the false oblation.' Thus it is said.
2.4.8.9	Then he should take back that evil deed from the murder of his mother or father, if he eats a false oblation."
2.4.10.16	"I offer the immortal, settled in the Prāṇa, for the sake of Shiva, not for destruction. To Prāṇa, svāhā." Thus he offers the Prāṇa oblation five times. "I offer the immortal settled in Apāna, for the sake Shiva, not for destruciton. To Apāna, svāhā" Thus he offers the Apāna oblation five times.
2.4.8.10	Having offered a hundred tawny cows, especially to Brahmins, one should accept the evil of one who eats a false oblation.
2.4.8.11	One should say: "One should take the first for existence, the second for non-existence, and the third for 'there is no' and the fourth for 'there will be'.
2.4.8.12	In the middle, for the attainment of all goals." So it is said.
2.4.10.17	Then, having worshipped the deity, he recites, "Whose virtues of Vishnu shall I praise?"
2.4.10.18	Then he performs the covering, saying, "You are the covering of immortality." Having brought water and covered it, he performs the sipping ritual, saying, "He who knows the abode of water becomes the abode of water."
2.4.10.19	Then, having offered betel nuts, he dismisses the deity.
2.4.8.13	Having thus known, one should undertake all actions. One should undertake all actions."
2.4.9.1	Now we shall explain the procedure of wearing the sacred thread.
2.4.10.20	The revered Agniveshya says that after installing Keshava in the ocean of milk, or on Meru, or in the solar disc, and offering oblations in water, one should give a fourth part to a brahmin.
2.4.11.1	Now we shall explain the option of the Sun.
2.4.11.2	For one who desires longevity, or one who desires brilliance, or one who seeks fame, or one who wishes prosperity, or one who wants sons, or one who longs for beauty, it is said to be beneficial.
2.4.9.2	In the bright fortnight, on an auspicious day, a Brahmin girl or a Brahmin widow, having washed her hands and feet well, pure, wearing white, not wet clothes, having gone to where cotton is, taking a ripe fruit, having smeared a cow-dung-sized square altar with cow dung, having installed the yantra in its center, sitting facing east or north, having tied the thread layer by layer, never makes it low.
2.4.9.3	He gives to a brahmin.
2.4.11.3	One should not eat at night, and one should avoid intercourse with a corpse.
2.4.11.4	One becomes pure by covering oneself with clean, white, and dry clothes, being pure and restrained.
2.4.11.5	Then, on the next day, on a Sunday, when the sun has just risen, having smeared a cow-dung-sized square altar in the middle, having placed a golden or silver lotus, or having drawn an eight-petaled lotus with a pericarp on the ground.
2.4.9.4	Then the Brāhmaṇa, having bought gold, or grain, or wealth, with well-washed hands and feet, having sipped water, with pure hands, facing east or north, having sat down, counting with the fingers of his right hand, joined together, ninety-six times, and having multiplied it by three, he then cleanses it with water, with the three verses, "The waters are the best, the waters are the most bountiful," and with the four verses, "The golden-colored ones, the pure ones, the purifying ones," and with this Anuvāka, "Pavamāna is the golden one."
2.4.9.5	Having invited the Brahmanas, one stands facing east, two stand facing west, and having made a thread of the right hand with the formula "Bhūr Bhuvah Svah," he makes it three-fold and releases it on the sacrificial tree.
2.4.9.6	He strikes with grass.
2.4.11.8	In the first leaf of the Sākarṇikā, one should place the Sun with its horses in the south, the Thousand-rayed in the west, and the Martanda in the east.
2.4.11.9	In the north, one should place Ravi, the Sun, and in the middle, one should place Bhāskara.
2.4.11.10	Having thus placed the twelve suns in order, and having placed in the middle the form of all the suns, he then cleanses with water, reciting the three verses, "The waters are firm, the waters are bountiful," and the four verses, "The golden-colored, the pure, the shining ones," and with this Anuvaka, "Pavamana, the golden-born one."
2.4.9.7	Taking the thread in his hand, he encircles it with his knees. "May Prajapati settle you with that deity, firm like Angiras. " Then the second: "May Prajapati, with that deity, settle you firm like Angiras." "Then the third: "May Prajapatis settle you with that divinity, firm like Angira." "Then, having made a knot, "May Prajapatis settle you with that divine Angiras."
2.4.11.11	Then with red sandalwood, red flowers, and red color, the teacher worships with incense, flowers, incense, lamps, and water for washing the feet, saying, "Salutations to him, salutations to him." Then he dismisses the deities, saying, "Salutations to him, salutlations to him."
2.4.11.12	As before, he dismisses them with the twelve names as he had invoked them.
2.4.9.8	Then one becomes one who wears the sacrificial thread, saying, "I wear the sacrificial thread for long life, for good offspring, for good strength, for lordship over all the Vedas, for prosperity, for fame, for Brahman, for brahminical splendor."
2.4.9.9	Having sipped water, one becomes fit for all rites. One becomes fit for all the rites.
2.4.10.1	Now we shall explain the propitiation of the deities.
2.4.11.13	The teacher should be given dakṣiṇā according to one's ability.
2.4.11.14	Thus, having performed the worship on the days of the Sun in a year, and having fed Brahmins, one who desires longevity attains long life.
2.4.11.15	One who desires brilliance becomes brilliant, one who desires fame becomes famous, one who desires prosperity becomes prosperous.
2.4.11.16	One who wants a son gets a son.
2.4.11.17	One who wishes for everything gets everything.
2.4.10.2	Having covered the pure, white, and dry (cloth) with a sacred hand, having worshipped the twilight after entering (the temple), having performed the fire rites, one should invoke the deity.
2.4.10.3	In the mandala, on the ground, in water, in the blazing fire, and also in the image, having invoked Hari, one should worship. The wise one should mentally visualize a lotus inside the heart.
2.4.11.18	Thus has the Blessed Agnivesya said.
2.4.12.1	The Praṇava is the deity Agni, the form of the Supreme Brahman. The goddess Gāyatrī is the meter, and the sage is said to be Brahmā.
2.4.12.2	I pay homage to the Praṇava, which is the essence of all deities. Listen to the statement "Viṣṇu said" with the three-syllable Praṇava.
2.4.12.3	The A and U are the two syllables of the Praṇava.
2.4.10.4	In the center of the lotus, the light is established. In the center of that light, Mahāviṣṇu holds a conch, a disc, and a mace.
2.4.10.5	Thus, having invoked with the twelve names, one should say "To Keśava".
2.4.10.6	Then one should worship with sandalwood, etc., and lamps. In the maṇḍala, and in the mound, and in the same way, and in the blazing fire, having invoked Hari, one should worship.
2.4.12.4	A is Agni, U is Surya, and M is Chandra.
2.4.12.5	A is Brahma, U is Vishnu, and M is Ishvara.
2.4.12.6	A is neuter, U is masculine, and M is feminine.
2.4.12.7	A is a mixed color, U is red, and M is white.
2.4.10.7	If he is making an image, then, whether of gold or of wood, or if unable, of stone, having made it with four arms holding a conch, a discus, and a mace, and having installed it in a house or a temple, he consecrates it with the three verses beginning with "The waters have stood, the divine ones," and the four verses beginning with "Golden-colored, pure, shining," and the Anuvaka beginning with "Pavamana, the golden-born."
2.4.12.8	They are without examples, consisting of the letter "o", consisting of the three times, consisting of the three worlds, consisting of the Rig, Yajus, and Sama, consisting of the triad of states, bestowing great lordship by uttering the Pranava, located in the root, throat, and brow, consisting of A, U, and M, consisting of the acute, acute, and acute, I shall describe the great secret.
2.4.10.8	Then, having invoked the deity with the names of Keshava and others, he offers clothes with the verse "You two offer clothes." Then, having offered incense with the verse "The gateway of fragrance," he offers flowers with the verse "He who knows the flower of water." Then, having presented incense with the verse, "You are incense," he offers a lamp with the verse, "Light up!" He applies unguents with the remaining part.
2.4.12.9	In the Rig Veda, in the Yajur Veda, in the Sama Veda, one should recite the Pranava three times.
2.4.12.10	For its further explanation.
2.5.1.1	Now we shall explain the rites of offering oblations to the Grahas, guests, and deities.
2.5.1.2	The Grahas clearly lead a person who lacks faith, who has not offered oblations, who does not recite mantras, and who has abandoned auspicious rites, to Yama's abode.
2.4.10.9	The water for the feet is called argha. The water for sipping is called ācamanīya.
2.4.10.10	Then he cooks the rice.
2.4.10.11	He cooks it with a prastha measure of ghee or milk.
2.4.10.12	Then the food is prepared.
2.5.1.3	I shall describe the offerings to be made to the fierce-acting planets moving along the path of the stars, for the sake of peace, according to the prescribed method.
2.5.1.4	In each month, in each season, in each solstice, in lunar and solar eclipses, in the natal star, in the equinox, whether auspicious or inauspicious, one who uses the hospitality of those planets even from the year obtains all desires.
2.4.10.13	Having given the truth, he sprinkles with the verse, "I sprinkle you with truth and righteousness." He sprinkles.
2.4.10.14	Then, touching the food, with the verse, “I am the first-born of truth,” he performs the spreading with the verse, "You are the spreading of immortality."
2.4.10.15	Then the offering to Prāṇa.
2.5.1.5	Having performed the rites of one fire,
2.5.1.6	The Sun and Mars are red, the Moon and Mercury are white, and the Moon's son and Jupiter are both yellow.
2.5.1.7	Know that Saturn is black, and so are Rahu and Ketu. The wise one should use flowers of the colors of the planets.
2.5.1.8	And also the oblation and offerings, and incense and garlands, should be offered in due order to all of them.
2.5.1.9	Thus it is said.
2.5.1.10	The sacrificial twigs of Arka are for the Sun, of Palasa for the Moon, of Khadira for Mars, of Apamarga for Mercury, of Ashvattha for Jupiter, of Udumbara for Venus, of Sami for Saturn, of Durva for Rahu and of Kusha for Ketu.
2.4.10.16	"I offer the immortal, settled in the Prāṇa, for the sake of Shiva, not for destruction. To Prāṇa, svāhā." Thus he offers the Prāṇa oblation five times. "I offer the immortal settled in Apāna, for the sake Shiva, not for destruciton. To Apāna, svāhā" Thus he offers the Apāna oblation five times.
2.5.1.11	In the middle, a circle for the Sun, in the southeast, a square for Soma, in the south, a triangle for Angaraka, in the northeast, a bow-shaped for Budha, in the north, a long rectangle for Brihaspati, in the east, a five-sided for Shukra, in the west, a bow-like for Shani, in the southwest, a sickle-shaped for Rahu, in the northwest, a flag-like for Ketu.
2.4.10.17	Then, having worshipped the deity, he recites, "Whose virtues of Vishnu shall I praise?"
2.4.10.18	Then he performs the covering, saying, "You are the covering of immortality." Having brought water and covered it, he performs the sipping ritual, saying, "He who knows the abode of water becomes the abode of water."
2.4.10.19	Then, having offered betel nuts, he dismisses the deity.
2.5.1.12	Having placed the Paridhana and so on up to the mouth of the fire, one offers from the cooked (food).
2.5.1.13	"We choose Agni as the messenger with truth. He is the lord of these." To Aditya.
2.5.1.14	"The Soma said to me in the water, 'May I grow.' The Soma said, 'May I be bright.' To Soma."
2.5.1.15	"Agni is the head. The earth is auspicious. The lord of the field. To Angaraka."
2.4.10.20	The revered Agniveshya says that after installing Keshava in the ocean of milk, or on Meru, or in the solar disc, and offering oblations in water, one should give a fourth part to a brahmin.
2.4.11.1	Now we shall explain the option of the Sun.
2.4.11.2	For one who desires longevity, or one who desires brilliance, or one who seeks fame, or one who wishes prosperity, or one who wants sons, or one who longs for beauty, it is said to be beneficial.
2.4.11.3	One should not eat at night, and one should avoid intercourse with a corpse.
2.4.11.4	One becomes pure by covering oneself with clean, white, and dry clothes, being pure and restrained.
2.5.1.16	"Be thou awakened! This is Vishnu. Thou art the king of Vishnu." To Budha.
2.5.1.17	"O Brihaspati, beyond Indra, the Maruts, the Brahman-born." To Brihaspati.
2.5.1.18	"We invoke you all around for Indra, the bright one, and Indraani." To Shukra.
2.5.1.19	"May the Goddesses be gracious to us. O Prajapati, not thine. This is the sacrificial grass. Come hither." To Shanischara.
2.4.11.5	Then, on the next day, on a Sunday, when the sun has just risen, having smeared a cow-dung-sized square altar in the middle, having placed a golden or silver lotus, or having drawn an eight-petaled lotus with a pericarp on the ground.
2.5.1.20	With what wonder did it happen to us? When the cow, when the goddess Nirriti bound you. To Rahu.
2.5.1.21	Brahma, making a banner for the gods, the variegated, variegated, he makes it for him. To Ketu.
2.5.1.22	One should offer oblations of ghee, with the verses, eight thousand, eight hundred or twenty-eight times for each verse.
2.5.1.23	One should offer oblations of ghee with each verse.
2.4.11.6	In the eastern leaf, one should place the Sun, and in the southeast, the Sun of the day. Having placed Vivasvat in the south, one should place Bhaga in the southwest.
2.4.11.7	Varuna in the western leaf, and Indra in the northwest. Then Savitar in the northeast, and Aditya in the north.
2.5.1.24	Havisya food to Aditya, ghee-rice to Soma, jaggery-rice to Angaraka, milk-rice to Budha, curd-rice to Brihaspati, ghee-rice for Shukra, rice mixed with sesame and peas to Shani, rice mixed with Rahu and Mars, and variegated rice to Ketu. If any of these are not available, then Havisya food is offered to all.
2.4.11.8	In the first leaf of the Sākarṇikā, one should place the Sun with its horses in the south, the Thousand-rayed in the west, and the Martanda in the east.
2.4.11.9	In the north, one should place Ravi, the Sun, and in the middle, one should place Bhāskara.
2.5.1.25	He offers to Aryaman, Soma, the king, as the Svishtakrit.
2.5.1.26	From the Jaya onwards, it is accomplished up to the gift of a cow and a bull.
2.5.1.27	He worships the Grahas in front of the fire.
2.4.11.10	Having thus placed the twelve suns in order, and having placed in the middle the form of all the suns, he then cleanses with water, reciting the three verses, "The waters are firm, the waters are bountiful," and the four verses, "The golden-colored, the pure, the shining ones," and with this Anuvaka, "Pavamana, the golden-born one."
2.5.1.28	"Then having worshipped with his own mantras, having offered oblations, having saluted, having circumambulated, having sat down facing the east with his back to the fire, he purifies himself with water with the verses beginning with "The waters are firm, the waters are mighty."
2.4.11.11	Then with red sandalwood, red flowers, and red color, the teacher worships with incense, flowers, incense, lamps, and water for washing the feet, saying, "Salutations to him, salutations to him." Then he dismisses the deities, saying, "Salutations to him, salutlations to him."
2.4.11.12	As before, he dismisses them with the twelve names as he had invoked them.
2.5.1.29	Then he gives the Dakṣiṇā.
2.5.1.30	A tawny cow to Āditya, a conch to Soma, a red bull to Angāraka, gold to Budha, cloth to Brihaspati, silver to Shukra, a black cow to Śanaiścara, a goat to Rāhu, and an elephant to Ketu.
2.5.1.31	If all are not available, then gold.
2.5.1.32	Or whatever pleases the teacher.
2.4.11.13	The teacher should be given dakṣiṇā according to one's ability.
2.4.11.14	Thus, having performed the worship on the days of the Sun in a year, and having fed Brahmins, one who desires longevity attains long life.
2.4.11.15	One who desires brilliance becomes brilliant, one who desires fame becomes famous, one who desires prosperity becomes prosperous.
2.4.11.16	One who wants a son gets a son.
2.4.11.17	One who wishes for everything gets everything.
2.5.1.33	Just as a machine that has been set up is stopped by another machine, so also the terrible (machine) that has been set in motion should always be quickly pacified.
2.5.1.34	Just as armor is a protection against blows from weapons, so also pacification is a protection against the afflictions of fate.
2.5.1.35	For one who is non-violent, disciplined, whose wealth is earned through Dharma, and who always abides by the rules, the planets are always benevolent.
2.5.1.36	The gods, the planets, the kings, and especially the Brahmanas, when worshipped, worship in return; when slighted, they burn.
2.5.1.37	The gods show good and bad by assuming the form of planets.
2.5.1.38	They show good and bad.
2.4.11.18	Thus has the Blessed Agnivesya said.
2.4.12.1	The Praṇava is the deity Agni, the form of the Supreme Brahman. The goddess Gāyatrī is the meter, and the sage is said to be Brahmā.
2.4.12.2	I pay homage to the Praṇava, which is the essence of all deities. Listen to the statement "Viṣṇu said" with the three-syllable Praṇava.
2.4.12.3	The A and U are the two syllables of the Praṇava.
2.4.12.4	A is Agni, U is Surya, and M is Chandra.
2.4.12.5	A is Brahma, U is Vishnu, and M is Ishvara.
2.4.12.6	A is neuter, U is masculine, and M is feminine.
2.4.12.7	A is a mixed color, U is red, and M is white.
2.5.2.1	Now if a post were to grow at an inopportune time, or a heron or a pigeon were to enter the house, or a cow were to be milked, or a cow would milk herself, or a bull would scratch itself, or smoke would arise from a fireless place, or a fireless place would blaze, or honey would appear, or a tree would grow, or a mushroom would appear, or frogs would be seen on the ground, or dogs would give birth, or a wife would scold her husband, or in other such calamities.
2.4.12.8	They are without examples, consisting of the letter "o", consisting of the three times, consisting of the three worlds, consisting of the Rig, Yajus, and Sama, consisting of the triad of states, bestowing great lordship by uttering the Pranava, located in the root, throat, and brow, consisting of A, U, and M, consisting of the acute, acute, and acute, I shall describe the great secret.
2.5.2.2	Then, having drawn the lines for the assembly of the gods, etc., from the mouth of the fire, one offers two oblations with the verses, "O Vastospati, may we be well-protected."
2.5.2.3	"O Vastospati! May we be well-shielded. O Indra and Agni! What is our beautiful form? Who today yokes us? May you be of one mind."
2.5.2.4	From the offering to Svishtakrit onwards, it is accomplished up to the giving of the gift of a cow.
2.4.12.9	In the Rig Veda, in the Yajur Veda, in the Sama Veda, one should recite the Pranava three times.
2.4.12.10	For its further explanation.
2.5.1.1	Now we shall explain the rites of offering oblations to the Grahas, guests, and deities.
2.5.1.2	The Grahas clearly lead a person who lacks faith, who has not offered oblations, who does not recite mantras, and who has abandoned auspicious rites, to Yama's abode.
2.5.2.5	He places the remnant of the Agnihotra offering on the Samī leaves to the west of the fire with the verse, "May the goddesses protect us from all sides."
2.5.2.6	He should take the water used for washing the pot and the remaining ghee and put them in the vessels used for pouring out.
2.5.2.7	He should sprinkle them with the verse, “We choose that which is auspicious.”
2.5.1.3	I shall describe the offerings to be made to the fierce-acting planets moving along the path of the stars, for the sake of peace, according to the prescribed method.
2.5.1.4	In each month, in each season, in each solstice, in lunar and solar eclipses, in the natal star, in the equinox, whether auspicious or inauspicious, one who uses the hospitality of those planets even from the year obtains all desires.
2.5.2.8	Having cooked the food, he honours the Brahmins and recites the benediction "May there be welfare, may there be welfare."
2.5.2.9	The auspicious rite is explained.
2.5.3.1	The rite of offering oblations in honour of the gods, the oblation for longevity, should be performed every year, every six months, every four months, or every month, at the birth star.
2.5.1.5	Having performed the rites of one fire,
2.5.1.6	The Sun and Mars are red, the Moon and Mercury are white, and the Moon's son and Jupiter are both yellow.
2.5.1.7	Know that Saturn is black, and so are Rahu and Ketu. The wise one should use flowers of the colors of the planets.
2.5.3.2	Then having drawn the lines for the altar of the gods, he pours out the grains for the oblations, saying, "I pour out what is agreeable to the long-lived Agni."
2.5.3.3	Or silently.
2.5.3.4	Then he pours out the grain, saying, "What is agreeable to your breath, I pour out."
2.5.3.5	Or silently
2.5.3.6	Having sprinkled them, carried them, made them into three heaps, and washed them three times, he places them.
2.5.1.8	And also the oblation and offerings, and incense and garlands, should be offered in due order to all of them.
2.5.1.9	Thus it is said.
2.5.1.10	The sacrificial twigs of Arka are for the Sun, of Palasa for the Moon, of Khadira for Mars, of Apamarga for Mercury, of Ashvattha for Jupiter, of Udumbara for Venus, of Sami for Saturn, of Durva for Rahu and of Kusha for Ketu.
2.5.3.10	This is the procedure for all the offerings of cooked rice.
2.5.3.11	Having placed the garment and other things in front of the fire, one offers from the cooked rice, reciting the Puronuvākyā verse "May your life be given to you from all directions" and then offers with the Yājyā verse "O Agni, giver of life, accepting the oblation".
2.5.3.12	One offers oblations of ghee.
2.5.1.11	In the middle, a circle for the Sun, in the southeast, a square for Soma, in the south, a triangle for Angaraka, in the northeast, a bow-shaped for Budha, in the north, a long rectangle for Brihaspati, in the east, a five-sided for Shukra, in the west, a bow-like for Shani, in the southwest, a sickle-shaped for Rahu, in the northwest, a flag-like for Ketu.
2.5.3.13	Then he places the Agni, the vessel of ghee and the vessel of cooked rice in between.
2.5.3.14	He makes the offering with the formula, "Thou art offered with a thousand showers."
2.5.3.15	"May the god who is the lord of life, the one who wears the hide, the trident-holder, the one who is the Brahman, the one who has lifted up the Brahman, may he grant me life. To him I offer oblation with ghee, svāhā."
2.5.1.12	Having placed the Paridhana and so on up to the mouth of the fire, one offers from the cooked (food).
2.5.1.13	"We choose Agni as the messenger with truth. He is the lord of these." To Aditya.
2.5.1.14	"The Soma said to me in the water, 'May I grow.' The Soma said, 'May I be bright.' To Soma."
2.5.1.15	"Agni is the head. The earth is auspicious. The lord of the field. To Angaraka."
2.5.3.16	Shining from the middle of his body, the shining one, the heat-ray, who has come, having removed from the terrible noose of death, may the god eat ghee for our life. Svāhā.
2.5.3.17	The light of Brahman, the embryo which she placed in the wives of Brahman, the conqueror of many forms, the golden-garlanded, the sun, the worshipped, we increase for life with ghee, svāhā.
2.5.1.16	"Be thou awakened! This is Vishnu. Thou art the king of Vishnu." To Budha.

2.5.1.18	"We invoke you all around for Indra, the bright one, and Indraani." To Shukra.
2.5.1.19	"May the Goddesses be gracious to us. O Prajapati, not thine. This is the sacrificial grass. Come hither." To Shanischara.
2.5.3.18	They call her Śrī, Lakṣmī, Oupalā, Ambikā, Gā, Ṣaṣṭhī, Jayā, Indrasenī. We offer to her, the knowledge, the source of Brahman, the one of similar form, for our life, with ghee, svāhā.
2.5.1.20	With what wonder did it happen to us? When the cow, when the goddess Nirriti bound you. To Rahu.
2.5.1.21	Brahma, making a banner for the gods, the variegated, variegated, he makes it for him. To Ketu.
2.5.1.22	One should offer oblations of ghee, with the verses, eight thousand, eight hundred or twenty-eight times for each verse.
2.5.3.19	All the daughters of Daksha, all the mothers, all the mothers of a thousand, of various forms, of various forms with their sons, with their husbands, with their companions, may they enjoy this ghee for life, svāhā.
2.5.1.24	Havisya food to Aditya, ghee-rice to Soma, jaggery-rice to Angaraka, milk-rice to Budha, curd-rice to Brihaspati, ghee-rice for Shukra, rice mixed with sesame and peas to Shani, rice mixed with Rahu and Mars, and variegated rice to Ketu. If any of these are not available, then Havisya food is offered to all.
2.5.3.20	The divine hosts, of many forms, the ancient ones, may they destroy our life and our heroes. To them I offer many times in ghee. May they not injure our offspring or our heroes. Svāhā.
2.5.3.21	The one who was in the beginning, from whom the world's protector came, to whom the world goes at the end of time, may that god eat our ghee offering here for our life. Svāhā.
2.5.1.25	He offers to Aryaman, Soma, the king, as the Svishtakrit.
2.5.1.26	From the Jaya onwards, it is accomplished up to the gift of a cow and a bull.
2.5.1.27	He worships the Grahas in front of the fire.
2.5.3.22	Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Maruts, Sadhyas, Rishis, Yakshas, Gandharvas, Pitrs, Vishvas, Bhrigus, Serpents, and Angiras - having offered ghee to all of them, we always worship for longevity. Svāhā.
2.5.3.23	Thus, when multiplied by twenty-six hundred, the number of oblations becomes eight thousand.
2.5.1.28	"Then having worshipped with his own mantras, having offered oblations, having saluted, having circumambulated, having sat down facing the east with his back to the fire, he purifies himself with water with the verses beginning with "The waters are firm, the waters are mighty."
2.5.3.24	He offers the Savisthita oblation from the cooked (rice) to the other (deities).

2.5.3.27	Then, in front of the fire, he places the remnants of the oblation on a clump of Durva grass, with the two verses, "Do not harm us, do not harm our offspring."
2.5.1.29	Then he gives the Dakṣiṇā.
2.5.1.30	A tawny cow to Āditya, a conch to Soma, a red bull to Angāraka, gold to Budha, cloth to Brihaspati, silver to Shukra, a black cow to Śanaiścara, a goat to Rāhu, and an elephant to Ketu.
2.5.1.31	If all are not available, then gold.
2.5.1.32	Or whatever pleases the teacher.
2.5.3.28	Sitting down facing the fire, with his face turned towards the east, the group of priests eats the cooked rice in silence. "He says, "You are life, you are all-life, you are all life, you are life of all, may all life be mine, may I have all life."
2.5.3.29	Having eaten and sipped water, he touches his belly with the two verses, "O Indra, we fear you, the giver of welfare, the lord of the universe."
2.5.1.33	Just as a machine that has been set up is stopped by another machine, so also the terrible (machine) that has been set in motion should always be quickly pacified.
2.5.1.34	Just as armor is a protection against blows from weapons, so also pacification is a protection against the afflictions of fate.
2.5.1.35	For one who is non-violent, disciplined, whose wealth is earned through Dharma, and who always abides by the rules, the planets are always benevolent.
2.5.3.30	For the well-being of the princes afflicted by the planets, he should recite the Ghrta-sutra daily.
2.5.3.31	One should offer oblations with these very mantras.
2.5.3.32	One should make offerings with these very mantros.
2.5.3.33	One becomes free from poison.
2.5.1.36	The gods, the planets, the kings, and especially the Brahmanas, when worshipped, worship in return; when slighted, they burn.
2.5.1.37	The gods show good and bad by assuming the form of planets.
2.5.1.38	They show good and bad.
2.5.3.34	This is the ritual for the cure of those afflicted by spirits. The oblation to the serpents and the oblation to the Gandharvas are offered to the five-headed serpents.
2.5.3.35	It indeed becomes a remedy.
2.5.3.36	This is the ritual for those who have performed the oblations and those who follow the oblations. The other oblations are performed according to the stages of life and the places of residence.
2.5.4.1	Now we shall explain the ritual for conquering untimely death.

2.5.10.3	Having kindled the fire, at the time when the wind blows from the west, he puts on a black garment and a black turban. "Thou art Marut, the strength of the Maruts, thou breakest the stream of waters. The Maruts delight in the hawk-like, swift, vigorous, well-praised one, by whom the fierce one, let loose by Indra, goes. The Asvins put it on for prosperity."
2.5.10.4	In front of the fire, they place a black horse, a black cloud, and a black man facing east. To the south, they place a pot of food, and behind it, they place a garland of rain-bringing flowers.

2.5.10.10	Whatever is your good fortune, whatever is this gambling, O Varuna, that I have done, I go to you. You are our Agni, you are our Agni, O Agni, you have come. Your anger is gone. We worship the supreme Triyambaka. One should offer oblations of kindling woods with these ten mantras, reciting each mantra a hundred times.

2.5.10.18	He fills a pot with water.
2.5.10.19	Pour down rain from heaven with water. You are the ocean, born of water. You are primordial strength, belonging to the ocean. Stretch out the earth, break the heavenly sky. Give us the opening of heaven. Be the lord, pour down the covering.

2.6.1.14	Now we shall explain the procedure of bathing.
2.6.1.15	One digs up clay for bathing.
2.6.1.16	"O clay, remove my sin, whatever wrong I have done, by you being destroyed, may I live for a hundred autumns. O clay, give me nourishment, everything is established in you."

Whatever I have eaten of the wicked and gifts from sinners, whatever evil I have done with mind, speech, or deed, may Indra, Varuna, Brihaspati, and Savitar purify it again and again."
2.6.2.5	Then he offers them with folded hands, saying, "May the friendly waters and plants be."
2.6.2.6	He directs his gaze towards the direction where his enemy is located, saying, "Let those who are unfriendly to him be."
2.5.11.9	Having offered the oblations beginning with Varunīya and ending with Sviṣṭakṛt, one should mix the remaining food with ghee or honey in a pot or a vessel.
2.5.11.10	With the two verses, "The gentle breezes..."

Whatever is leftover, unfit to eat, or ill-done by me, may all the waters purify me. Svāhā to the acceptance of the wicked!
2.5.11.17	Those who are the deities of the house, and those who are the fierce demons and ghosts, to them I offer oblations for rain. May they be peaceful and perform peace. Obeisance to all. Obeisance to the beings. Obeisance. Having filled a pot with water and saying "Raise the earth," and a black cow.
2.5.11.18	"Those who are the gods in heaven" - then the deities stand up.

When the time for the Homa and Darsha-Pūrnamāsa sacrifices has passed, when the Āgrayana rite has not been performed, when the wife has given birth to a child without the rite of Siṃmanta, when there is twin birth among women and cows, when there is intercourse with a woman in her menses, when there is sexual intercourse during the day, when the boy has not been given the rites of initiation, when there is inversion of mantras, when there is reversal of rites, when there is violation of the vow by a student, when the girdle is cut, when the staff is broken, when the sacrificial thread is not worn, when there is omission of twilight prayers, when there is neglect of fire rites, when there has been omission of the water pot, and other such things, having established the fire as seen in the scriptures, having spread it around, having taken four spoonfuls of ghee, he offers with the verse, "O Agni, protect us from harm, svāhā."
2.7.4.2	Having offered oblations with the great formulas in front and above, this itself is his expiation. The unbroken performance becomes continuous.
2.7.1.7	He does not eat without begging, nor does he shave his beard. He does not shave his head, nor does he wear clothes.

2.7.1.11	Having performed the purification ceremony, one becomes pure.
2.7.1.12	One should perform the Savitri vow on that very day and release it on that very day, says (the text).
2.7.2.1	The fire at the time of the marriage ceremony is called "aupasana".
2.7.4.4	This is your natural place of birth. Having brought the fire from the house of a learned brahmin, and having offered it, he awakens it with two verses. Having spread it and sprinkled it, he offers the expiation: "O Agni, the five-hotr, the one-hotr, and the one who knows the mind, I offer to Indra with the invocations."
2.7.2.2	In that (Agni) the rites of the house are performed.
2.7.2.3	By its worship, one becomes entitled to Agnihotra; by the Parvan (rites), one becomes entitled to the sacrifice of the Carus at the Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa.
2.7.2.4	Therefore, one should always carry, follow, churn, and bring from the house of a learned Brāhmaṇa.
2.7.2.5	And fasting is followed by the wife or the husband.
2.7.4.5	If, however, he breaks the celibacy for four days, he should offer the oblation to Sarasvati, Manasa, Inda and Vyahriti with Pranava.
2.7.5.1	If a student becomes a fallen student due to emission of semen in an improper place, or due to omission of twilight prayers, or due to omitting to offer water to the pot, or due to neglecting the fire rituals,
2.7.2.6	He should offer these oblations: "Svāhā to Mitra, Svāhā to Varuna, Svāhā Soma, Svāhā Surya, Svāhā Agni, Svāhā, to Agni the ascetic, the people-loving, the fire-loving, Svāhā.

2.7.5.6	The teacher gives a cow.
2.7.2.12	Having sprinkled the ground with water, he covers it with branches of Udumbara, Palasa or Plaksha trees. Having kindled fire from sacrificial wood, he brings it from the house of a learned Brāhmaṇa, makes it hot, and lights it. Having removed the branches, he recites "Om, Bhu, Bhuva, Svara, Pratiṣṭha" and places it.
2.7.5.7	Then, if in a dream, white clothes fall, one should discard the old clothes and put on new ones.
2.7.5.8	At dawn, having emerged from the village towards the east or north, one should bathe in the rivers.
2.7.5.9	By bathing in rivers flowing towards the ocean, one attains the fruit for three nights. By fasting on the day of the new moon and bathing in rivers flowing to the ocean, one obtains the fruit for a fortnight.
2.7.5.10	O Saritapati, you are the new moon, the endless, in the two solstices.

2.7.2.15	Having offered this Prajapati-offering, the Manasa-offering and the Saptapati-offering, one offers two offerings of the Miṇḍa-oblation with the verses, "Whatever was lost from my body, Agni has again given me the eye."
2.7.5.11	Thus he performs the bath according to the prescribed procedure.
2.7.5.12	Having recited the Anuvaka "May Indra again enter me", the Blessed Agniveshya says that one becomes purified.
2.7.6.1	Then, after bathing in the seasons, she should not look at her husband's face with effort, and should not show her face to him. She should not sleep with him that day.
2.7.6.2	If she sleeps with him,
2.7.2.16	He offers the expiatory oblation with the verse, "O Agni, thou art not censured, thou art not condemned. Thou art truth, thou art held by truth, thou art truth, thou carriest the oblation with truth. Do thou bestow truth, truth, truth, Svāhā."
2.7.6.3	The son born on that day has a short life and is devoid of wealth. The woman who conceives on the fifth day gives birth to a barren woman.

2.7.6.7	On the sixteenth day, he obtains a son with the fame of Brahma, not like others. There is no further increase after that, only the enjoyment of desires.
2.7.6.8	Therefore, one should make every effort to observe the vow until the sixteenth day. If the increase is white, one obtains a son; if the increase is red, one obtains a woman.
2.7.2.19	As before, having fed the Brahmanas with food, having recited the benedictory verses, having performed the rites of prosperity, the well-known Agniya-sthalipaka is performed.

2.7.6.21	In the same way, at the time of the season, he who performs this rite every month, obtains a son who is handsome, intelligent, and strong. The Blessed Āgnīveśya says, "He obtains a strong son."
2.7.7.1	I will explain the Brahma-Kūrca, the supreme body purification, and the Veda-winning Homa, which is without mantra and unsanctified.

2.7.6.3	The son born on that day has a short life and is devoid of wealth. The woman who conceives on the fifth day gives birth to a barren woman.
2.7.6.4	The woman who conceives in the sixth month will have sons and grandsons. The woman who conceived in the seventh month is like the eight-faced one.
2.7.9.13	By this the two, Aśrita and Duśrita, are explained.

2.7.9.24	If the offering is not stopped when the later time arrives, then this is a transgression of time. In that case, one should offer the mind-fire as an atonement.
2.7.9.25	One should also offer the mind- fire for the later one.
2.7.6.14	On the sixteenth, twelfth, fifteenth, fourteenth, ninth, sixth or eighth day,
2.7.6.15	having seen any of these, one should perform the purification as prescribed, having seen the auspicious and auspicious rise of the planets.

2.7.7.1	I will explain the Brahma-Kūrca, the supreme body purification, and the Veda-winning Homa, which is without mantra and unsanctified.
2.7.9.32	Then, on one day of the great sacrifices, having offered three oblations to Tantumati and having recited four or five or six or more times, one should recite the Varuni verses "O Varuna, that which is mine, I seek your protection. Whatever is yours, I seek your forgiveness." From the ninth night.
2.7.7.2	In eating the food of a Śūdra, in selling the Vedas, in the case of a crow, dog, or serpent having touched it, and in the case of animals and birds being anxious.
2.7.7.3	In the fifth case, when touched by an Mleccha, the purifying agent is Pañcagavya. For those of blue complexion, cow's urine should be used, and black cow-dung should be collected.
2.7.9.33	From now on, one should offer four oblations every ten days.
2.7.9.34	At the end of all, with the Vyāhṛtis, it is accomplished.
2.7.10.1	From now on, we shall explain the method of the life of a forest hermit.
2.7.10.2	Having practiced the blameless household life, one performs sacrifices.
2.7.7.4	The milk of a tawny-coloured cow, curd of a white cow, and ghee of a yellow cow should be taken, as it destroys great sins.
2.7.7.5	If all the colours are not available, then one should take from a yellow cow. One should give one pala of cow's urine, half an angula of cow dung,
2.7.7.6	One should give seven palas of milk, three palas of curd, one pala of ghee, and also Kusha water.
2.7.10.3	Having begotten a son, having educated him, having taught him the Veda, having established him in a livelihood, having entrusted the burden of the family to a virtuous son, having gone to the northern course, on the auspicious side of the month, on an auspicious constellation, wearing a garment of kuśa grass, hide, or bark, having matted hair, wearing a black antelope skin as an upper garment, having made the sign of departure, having deposited the fire on himself, with his wife or without his wife, he should resort to the forest.
2.7.7.7	Savitri is to be taken for cow's urine, Gandhadvara for cowdung, Appayasva for milk, Dadhikravan for curd.
2.7.7.8	The ghee is to be taken as Shukramasi. Thus, the water of Kusha is for the deity.
2.7.7.9	Having churned with the mantra "Aposhi sthamayo bhuva", having enchanted with the mantra "May not be harmed in our children", having taken out with the Pranava, having churned with the Pranava and having drunk with the Pranava.
2.7.10.4	Having kindled the fire of asceticism, he should attend to the fire in the evening and morning with bamboo, shyamaka, nīvara, and other wild roots and fruits, and herbs.
2.7.10.5	Having offered oblations to gods, brahmins, ancestors, spirits, and humans with fruits and seeds, he should dry up his body at the proper time with fasting, restraints, observances, and mantras, or by means of the fire.
2.7.10.6	He who eats only fallen leaves, who uses his teeth as a mortar, and who grinds on stone, should give to those who come for alms, even if it takes a long time.
2.7.7.10	To Agni, to Soma, to Iravatī, this Vishnu has wandered. O Prajapati, do not harm our offspring. Having offered the Gayatri verse, one should drink it with a Palasha leaf in the middle and a lotus leaf.
2.7.7.11	Whatever sin is present in the skin and bones of my body, all of it is burned by the water of the Brahmakurcha, like fire burns fuel.
2.7.8.1	Now we shall explain the expiations for the prescribed occasions.
2.7.8.2	One should recite the Vishnu-verse everywhere, "I praise Vishnu's prowess."
2.7.8.3	If one sneezes or spits during a ritual, one recites, "The thousand-headed man."
2.7.8.4	One should touch oneself with the thumb and ring finger, touching the right ear.
2.7.10.7	One who sleeps on a mat, one who is celibate, one who loves guests, one who is not envious, one who avoids quarrels, slander, and false speech, one who is always pure, one who does not show the roof of the village, one who loves to dwell in the forest, one who gives fearlessness to all beings, one who does no harm to others, one who does nothing harmful to others, one whose hermitages are not touched by others, one who is devoted to the one fire, one who is diligent, one who does not tread on the ground that has been sown or abandoned by others.
2.7.8.5	If he urinates, he should wash his feet, perform Ācamana, meditate on Oṃ mentally, become pure, and recite the two verses: "This entire universe is indeed a person."
2.7.8.6	If he urinates, perform the purification as before, and recite the three verses: "The person rises above the three feet."
2.7.8.7	If one has touched something impure, one should bathe in a pure body of water, perform the Ācamana ritual, and recite the four verses beginning with "Sarvahuta" from that sacrifice.
2.7.11.2	In the ascending lunar fortnight, on an auspicious day, after fasting for a while, he prepares the requisites.
2.7.11.3	He prepares requisites such as a robe of bark cloth, a sacred thread, sandals, a seat, a bamboo staff, a broom, a water pot, a gourd, a bowl, and a bundle of kuśa grass.
2.7.8.8	If he sees a Candala or a fallen person, he should rinse his mouth and gaze at the sun. The Brahman was his face, the Rajanya was made from his arms, the Vaishya was made from his thighs, and the Shudra was born from his feet. The moon was born from the mind, the sun was born from the eyes. One should recite these three verses.
2.7.11.4	Having kindled the fire, having entered the village from the forest, having shaved the hair and beard, one should bathe in rivers or in a pure pond.
2.7.11.5	Having sipped water, having approached Brahmins on the banks of a river or in a temple, without anger or hatred, one should renounce all actions.
2.7.11.6	One should not renounce the Vedas.
2.7.11.7	By renouncing the Vedas, one becomes a Shudra.
2.7.8.9	If the Homa is interrupted in the middle, one should recite three verses: "I know this person, the great one."
2.7.8.10	Having offered two Miṇḍāhuti oblations, one should complete the remaining part.
2.7.8.11	If the vessels are licked by dogs, etc., the wooden ones should be thrown into the fire, the earthen ones into water, and the metallic ones are purified with ashes.
2.7.11.8	Therefore, one should not abandon the Veda.
2.7.11.9	Having recited the mantra in the presence of a brahmin, one should drink water, saying, "I have abandoned it."
2.7.11.10	Having accepted the offerings from the brahmins up to the bamboo, looking at the circle of the sun, one should say aloud three times, "I have given it up."
2.7.8.12	Taking nine new vessels, one should recite the two verses: "O Vishnu, you are our last refuge. Which of Vishnu's powers shall I praise?"
2.7.8.13	One should offer six oblations, reciting the verses: "What was lost from my self, Agni has given me back. O Varuna, this is yours. I come to you. O Agni,
2.7.8.14	If the fire is extinguished by water, one should remove the fire, perform purification as before, kindle the fire, take the worldly fire, heat the ladle and spoon, wipe them, take four spoonfuls in the ladle, offer the full oblation, and perform the consecration as before.
2.7.11.11	Then, having approached the brahmin Nivita, the performer of many sacrifices, and having been told, "Give the staffs," and having taken the staffs, and having been authorized by the one who has performed the name-giving ceremony, he should properly attend to the duties. He should always have a beard, always wear the sacred thread, always worship at the morning and evening twilight, always bathe in the morning, always beg for alms, always observe the restraints, observances, and vows, always worship the Lord, always live in the house of the cow and the deity, free from fear, desire, anger, greed, delusion, pride, and envy. Thus it is said.
2.7.8.15	If the forest is impure, then taking another (forest) and taking four handfuls, one offers with the Purusha-sutra, following mentally.
2.7.8.16	If the child is dead, then he does not offer in the middle of that. For those days, he offers cooked rice.
2.7.8.17	In Vyatipaata, one gives that substance to a Brahmin. This is said by the revered Agniveshya.
2.7.11.12-15	Having practiced such and other Dharma, he will go to the heavenly world. Or, when the Brahmins are declining, having performed purification as before, abandoning all activities, he eats only water. The Blessed Āgnīveśya says that by worshipping the Lord alone, one becomes pure.
2.7.9.1	Now, we shall describe the expiations for the domestic rites.
2.7.9.2	The remaining ones are those of the Vedic rites.
2.7.9.3	The Brāhmaṇa of Śāṭyāyanī says: "The rites of one who has established the sacred fires are the rites of one who is a householder."
2.7.9.4	Here, the sacrificial cakes are the offerings.
3.1.1.1	At the time of sunset on the new moon day, having prepared food for the ancestors in the afternoon, having arranged seats of Darbha grass with the tips pointing towards the south, he invites even-numbered Brahmins who are pure, knowers of mantras, and have all their limbs, saying, "Please come."
3.1.1.2	One should not feed those who are related by birth, clan, or mantra, if one does not have any purpose.
2.7.9.5	The consecration of the milk, the water, the butter and the ghee is like that of the butter. The placing of the curd, the sprinkling, the cutting, the breaking, the removal, and the touching of the self are done for the purpose of removing the fear of Rudra, Rakshasa, Pitri, and Nairrita. Then one should touch the water.
3.1.1.3	Having kindled the fire, having strewn Darbha-grass with their tips towards the south and east, having placed the vessel of clarified butter within the strainer, having poured the clarified butter, having sanctified it, then he sprinkles it from left to right.
3.1.1.4	Having placed the Udumbara wood, he offers with the Udumbara ladle.
2.7.9.6	When everything is lost, destroyed, burnt, or inverted, one should offer two oblations of the Mīnda mantra: "Whatever was lost from me, may Agni restore my sight again."
3.1.1.5	Having performed the Ajyabhāgas, he invites the Pitrs, facing the east, with the verse, "O Pitrs, come, O Pitrs, who are friendly, by the deep paths of the ancients, giving us progeny and wealth, long life, and a hundred autumns."
2.7.9.7	Having recited the mantra "I sprinkle the spilled (water)," one should sprinkle and then settle down. Having recited the mantra, "The sky has spilled the earth," one should offer two oblations.
2.7.9.8	Having recited the mantra, "The gods have spilled the sky and the tree of heaven," one should give something.
3.1.1.6	He sprinkles water in that direction with the verse, "O divine waters, do you carry Agni to us. May the Fathers accept this sacrifice. May they who are seated and who partake of the food, bestow on us wealth with all heroes."
2.7.9.9	Then, having recited the mantra "Bhinna bhūmir bhūmnā" and having sprinkled the earth, one should sprinkle it with the mantra "Unnambahi pṛthivīm" and offer it with the mantra "Trayastriṃśat tantun".
2.7.9.10	One should throw wooden objects into the fire.
2.7.9.11	Then having recited the formula, "For the burnt one, for Nirriti," he should recite, "You go to the Rakshas in the southern or northern direction." He should offer three oblations of ghee with the formula, "The fires drive away the Rakshas."
2.7.9.12	If a part of the oblation is taken out, he should offer it with this formula.
2.7.9.13	By this the two, Aśrita and Duśrita, are explained.
2.7.9.14	One should drink water.
2.7.9.15	Having recited the formula, "To Rudra thee!" over the unburnt (body), and "To Yama thee!" over the ill-burnt (body), he should recite the formula, "O Agni, to thee who art forgiving, salutations, salutations. Do not injure me. Do not injure my house, my wealth, my cattle." and offer the oblation with the formula, "Svāhā to Agni who is forgiving."
2.7.9.16	"Indra, you are all around us." Again, he should offer with the verse, "Indra, hail!"
2.7.9.17	In the case of the burning of the boundary, he should offer the oblation with the verse, "O Agni, homage, homage to the burning."
2.7.9.18	From here onwards, the same. "You are the kindling wood of Agni." In the western half, "You are the wood of Yama." In the southern half, "You art the wood of Soma." In the northern half,
3.1.1.7	Having recited the Vyāhṛtis, he offers towards the east, saying, "To Soma, the father, Svāhā, salutations to Svāhā. To Yama, the son of Angiras, the father, salutations to Yama, the son Svāhā. Those waters that flow from the east and those that flow from the north, the sustainers of the entire world, have placed the father in the middle. Svāhā, salutation to Svāhā." He has placed the father in between the mountains, the great earth, the sky, the directions, the infinite, and the waters. Svāhā. He has placed the grandfather in between all the seasons, day and night with their junctions, the fortnights, and the months. Svāhā.
2.7.9.19	One should offer two oblations, saying, "May the kindlers be a hundred to us."
2.7.9.20	One should offer another oblation, saying, "You are Gandharva."
2.7.9.21	Then, in the case of reversal, one should offer four oblations, saying: "You are Agni, you are Agni, you have come, O Agni, O Prajapati."
3.1.1.8	Then he offers with names: "To him, Obeisance! To him, Obeisance!"
3.1.1.9	"Whatever my mother has desired, acting contrary to me, may my father destroy that semen. May another fall down. Obeisance! Obeisance!"
3.1.1.10	So also the second.
3.1.1.11	So also the third.
3.1.1.12	The mantra is recited thus: "Whatever my grandmother, whatever my great-grandmother..."
2.7.9.22	If the mind-fire is interrupted, one should perform the fifth offering.
2.7.9.23	If something is given when it is completed,
2.7.9.24	If the offering is not stopped when the later time arrives, then this is a transgression of time. In that case, one should offer the mind-fire as an atonement.
2.7.9.25	One should also offer the mind- fire for the later one.
2.7.9.26	Thus, the Prāṇāyāma is to be done for ten nights.
2.7.9.27	From the eleventh night onwards, fasting is prescribed for twenty nights, and from the thirtieth night onwards, it is prescribed for as long as one can.
2.7.9.28	It has been said that from the eleventh night onwards there are three nights with threads, and the twelve nights are interrupted. It is to be re-established again. This is also said.
3.1.2.1	Those fathers who are here and those who are not here, those whom we know and those whom we do not know, O Agni, you know them, O all-knowing one. They rejoice in the oblation given by you, with their desires. Svāhā to Svāhā! Whatever limb of yours the flesh-eater burned, the all-knowing one led you to the worlds. I now restore that to you. May the fathers be born again with all their limbs. Svāhā! Svāhā! O all-knowing Agni, carry the ghee to the fathers, where you know them to be hidden far away. May the ladle pour the ghee for him. May their blessings be true. With their desires. Svāh
2.7.9.29	Then, when the Parvan is over, having offered four oblations to Agni, the light, the mind, and the rays, and to Indra, one should perform the Sthalipaka offering to Agni, the path-maker, before the eighth day.
2.7.9.30	From then on, fasting should be observed.
3.1.2.2	Thus the second and the third.
3.1.2.3	The mantra "to the grandfathers, to the great-grandfathers" is recited.
3.1.2.4	Thus one offers oblations to food.
3.1.2.5	The mantra “to the food-bearing” is recited.
3.1.2.6	Then one offers the Sauvitkrti oblation with the mantra "to Agni, the food-bearer, to Svishtakrit, to Svāhā, salutations."
2.7.9.31	The rite of Homa is to be performed in the case of the omission of the rites of the Pitṛs in two or three Parvan days. It is settled that fasting is to be observed in the case of omission of the rites in two Parvan days.
2.7.9.32	Then, on one day of the great sacrifices, having offered three oblations to Tantumati and having recited four or five or six or more times, one should recite the Varuni verses "O Varuna, that which is mine, I seek your protection. Whatever is yours, I seek your forgiveness." From the ninth night.
2.7.9.33	From now on, one should offer four oblations every ten days.
2.7.9.34	At the end of all, with the Vyāhṛtis, it is accomplished.
2.7.10.1	From now on, we shall explain the method of the life of a forest hermit.
2.7.10.2	Having practiced the blameless household life, one performs sacrifices.
3.1.2.7	Having offered in the southern half of the eastern half, and having struck the ladle, he touches the food with the formula, "The earth is thy vessel, the heaven is thy cover. I offer thee in the mouth of Brahman, in the mouth of the learned Brahmanas, in the breath and out-breath. Thou art the imperishable. Thou art the best of the Pitrs here and in the other world. The earth is all around, Agni is the observer, for the sake of the gift not being lost. Thy greatness is the Rks. The earth is thy vessel... in the mouth of learned Brahmanas, I offer thee in thy breath and out- breath. Thou art the Imperishable. Thou art best of the grandfathers here and in the next world. The sky is all around, Vayu is the observer, the gift not being wasted. Thy greatness is Yajus. The earth is your vessel... in the breath and the out-breath of the learned Brahmins. Thou art the inexhaustible. Thou art the most excellent of the great-grandfathers here and in yonder world. The heaven is all around, the sun is the observer, and the gift is not lost. Thy greatness are the Sāmans. The earth is the vessel...
3.1.2.8	He sprinkles the Brahmanas.
3.1.2.9	After the Brahmanas have eaten, he asks them to give their consent to the leftovers.
2.7.10.3	Having begotten a son, having educated him, having taught him the Veda, having established him in a livelihood, having entrusted the burden of the family to a virtuous son, having gone to the northern course, on the auspicious side of the month, on an auspicious constellation, wearing a garment of kuśa grass, hide, or bark, having matted hair, wearing a black antelope skin as an upper garment, having made the sign of departure, having deposited the fire on himself, with his wife or without his wife, he should resort to the forest.
3.1.3.1	Taking a pitcher of water and a handful of darbha grass, he spreads the darbha grass with the tips towards the south. With his right hand facing downwards, he places three water pitchers above them, facing towards the south, and says: "May the ancestors be purified, may the grandfathers be purified, may great-grandfathers be purified."
2.7.10.4	Having kindled the fire of asceticism, he should attend to the fire in the evening and morning with bamboo, shyamaka, nīvara, and other wild roots and fruits, and herbs.
2.7.10.5	Having offered oblations to gods, brahmins, ancestors, spirits, and humans with fruits and seeds, he should dry up his body at the proper time with fasting, restraints, observances, and mantras, or by means of the fire.
2.7.10.6	He who eats only fallen leaves, who uses his teeth as a mortar, and who grinds on stone, should give to those who come for alms, even if it takes a long time.
3.1.3.2	"Do thou press down this (pit of) earth." He gives three balls, with the palms turned downwards, towards the south.
3.1.3.3	"This is thine, O father." He gives the ball to the father. "This is thine, grandfather." To the grandfather. "This is yours, great-grandfather." To the great-grandfather.
3.1.3.4	The fourth one silently.
3.1.3.5	He who has performed or not performed the rites.
3.1.3.6	If one does not know the names, one gives the ball to the father with the words, "Svāhā to the fathers seated in the earth."
3.1.3.7	"Svāhā to grandfather, seated in the sky."
3.1.3.8	"Svāhâ to great-grandfather, seated in heaven."
3.1.3.9	Here, one gives the garment and the unguent to the father, grandfather, and great-grandfather, and the ball to the ancestors.
2.7.10.7	One who sleeps on a mat, one who is celibate, one who loves guests, one who is not envious, one who avoids quarrels, slander, and false speech, one who is always pure, one who does not show the roof of the village, one who loves to dwell in the forest, one who gives fearlessness to all beings, one who does no harm to others, one who does nothing harmful to others, one whose hermitages are not touched by others, one who is devoted to the one fire, one who is diligent, one who does not tread on the ground that has been sown or abandoned by others.
3.1.3.10	"Aṅkṣvasāvaṅkṣvasāv iti trir āñjanam |
3.1.3.11	Abhyakṣvasāvābhyakṣvasāv iti tribhir abhyajanaṃ karoti |
3.1.3.12	"These are your fathers' garments. Let the fathers not take them from us. These are your grandfathers' garments. Let not the grandfathers take them from us." Having cut off the ten locks of hair, he places them. Having cut off his own hair in the earlier part of his life, he places it in the later part.
3.1.3.13	Then, having contracted the vessel, he says, "These waters, flowing with honey, are satisfying my sons and grandsons."
3.1.3.14	"The divine waters, flowing with nectar, satisfy both the fathers and the ancestors."
3.1.3.15	Having placed the vessel upside down and exchanging hands, he stands with six salutations, saying, "Salutations to you, O fathers, for the sake of life."
2.7.11.2	In the ascending lunar fortnight, on an auspicious day, after fasting for a while, he prepares the requisites.
2.7.11.3	He prepares requisites such as a robe of bark cloth, a sacred thread, sandals, a seat, a bamboo staff, a broom, a water pot, a gourd, a bowl, and a bundle of kuśa grass.
2.7.11.4	Having kindled the fire, having entered the village from the forest, having shaved the hair and beard, one should bathe in rivers or in a pure pond.
2.7.11.5	Having sipped water, having approached Brahmins on the banks of a river or in a temple, without anger or hatred, one should renounce all actions.
2.7.11.6	One should not renounce the Vedas.
2.7.11.7	By renouncing the Vedas, one becomes a Shudra.
2.7.11.8	Therefore, one should not abandon the Veda.
2.7.11.9	Having recited the mantra in the presence of a brahmin, one should drink water, saying, "I have abandoned it."
2.7.11.10	Having accepted the offerings from the brahmins up to the bamboo, looking at the circle of the sun, one should say aloud three times, "I have given it up."
3.1.3.16	Having gone to the water's edge, he offers water-libations three times with water-libations. This is your father's sweet wave of Sarasvati. As great as Agni and Earth are, so great is his measure, so great is its greatness. I give him this being as much as Agni is imperishable and uninterrupted, so may it be for your father, imperishable and uninterrupted. May you have the Svāhā. May you have Svāhā with the imperishable ones, together with those who live. The Ṛks are your greatness. This is your grandfather's sweet wave, as great as Vāyu and the atmosphere are, so great his measure, so much is its greatness. As much as Vāyu is imperishable and without interruption, so may it for your grandfather, imperishable and without obstruction. May you have Śvāhā. May you be with the imperishable Śvāhā, together with those living. The Yajus are your greatness.
3.1.3.17	This is thy great-grandfather, thy father's father. The sweet-flowing Sarasvati, as wide as the sun and the sky, is his measure, so great is his greatness. I give him to thee as a being, as the sun is imperishable and without decay. So may my great-grandfather, my father, be imperishable and without decline. May there be for him the Svāhā, the imperishable, together with them. May he live with thee. Thy greatness is the same as theirs.
2.7.11.11	Then, having approached the brahmin Nivita, the performer of many sacrifices, and having been told, "Give the staffs," and having taken the staffs, and having been authorized by the one who has performed the name-giving ceremony, he should properly attend to the duties. He should always have a beard, always wear the sacred thread, always worship at the morning and evening twilight, always bathe in the morning, always beg for alms, always observe the restraints, observances, and vows, always worship the Lord, always live in the house of the cow and the deity, free from fear, desire, anger, greed, delusion, pride, and envy. Thus it is said.
3.1.3.18	Having returned, he places it in the water pot and makes it flow towards him, saying, "May the fathers come back, the gentle ones, by the deep ancient paths, giving us offspring and wealth.
3.1.3.19	Then, in the month, may they return to our homes again to eat the oblation, having good offspring and good heroes."
3.1.3.20	This is the explanation of the Arghyavarsha, with its rules.
3.1.3.21	Meat is prescribed, but in the absence of meat, vegetables.
3.2.1.1	One who is going to perform the Aṣṭakā rite procures a bull, or a buffalo, or rice, or food, or honey, or ghee.
3.2.1.2	Purity is well-known.
3.1.1.1	At the time of sunset on the new moon day, having prepared food for the ancestors in the afternoon, having arranged seats of Darbha grass with the tips pointing towards the south, he invites even-numbered Brahmins who are pure, knowers of mantras, and have all their limbs, saying, "Please come."
3.1.1.2	One should not feed those who are related by birth, clan, or mantra, if one does not have any purpose.
3.1.1.3	Having kindled the fire, having strewn Darbha-grass with their tips towards the south and east, having placed the vessel of clarified butter within the strainer, having poured the clarified butter, having sanctified it, then he sprinkles it from left to right.
3.1.1.4	Having placed the Udumbara wood, he offers with the Udumbara ladle.
3.2.1.3	Having placed the fire on the Anurādha asterism, having strewn (Darbha-grass), having gone round along the right side of the fire, he pours out the rice-grains through a single strainer. He pours out this cake on four potsherds for the Pitrs, for the removal of distress. "He says, "I pour out this oblation for the Pitrs in the impulse of Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, for the Pitrs who are dear to them." He pours out the cake on four potshers thus: "For the Pitrs, to the Pitrs."
3.2.1.4	Having sprinkled silently, and having released the speech, he places the cake in the pot as he does the cake.
3.2.1.5	Or in one pot.
3.1.1.5	Having performed the Ajyabhāgas, he invites the Pitrs, facing the east, with the verse, "O Pitrs, come, O Pitrs, who are friendly, by the deep paths of the ancients, giving us progeny and wealth, long life, and a hundred autumns."
3.1.1.6	He sprinkles water in that direction with the verse, "O divine waters, do you carry Agni to us. May the Fathers accept this sacrifice. May they who are seated and who partake of the food, bestow on us wealth with all heroes."
3.2.1.6	Having poured it, he pours clarified butter and curds, and then sprinkles (the fire) with the formula, "O Aditi, do thou approve." To the right, towards the east, with the formula, “O Anumati, do thou approve.” To the west, towards the north, with the formula “O Sarasvati, do thou approve”. To the north, towards the east with the formula, "O God Savitr, do thou approve." Having sprinkled all around in a clockwise direction, he offers the Ajyabhāgas after pouring the Ajya into the Hotr's vessel.

3.1.1.9	"Whatever my mother has desired, acting contrary to me, may my father destroy that semen. May another fall down. Obeisance! Obeisance!"
3.1.1.10	So also the second.
3.1.1.11	So also the third.
3.1.1.12	The mantra is recited thus: "Whatever my grandmother, whatever my great-grandmother..."
3.2.2.5	He offers the sixth oblation. Agni, the bestower of what is well-offered, may he know and make all that is deficient or in excess in this rite well-offered and well-sacrificed. To Agni Svishtakrit, the bestower, the well-sacrificer, the universal sacrificer, the oblations of all expiations, the fulfiller of desires, to Svāhā, salutations with desires.

They rejoice in the oblation given by you, with their desires. Svāhā to Svāhā! Whatever limb of yours the flesh-eater burned, the all-knowing one led you to the worlds. I now restore that to you. May the fathers be born again with all their limbs. Svāhā! Svāhā! O all-knowing Agni, carry the ghee to the fathers, where you know them to be hidden far away. May the ladle pour the ghee for him.

Thy greatness are the Sāmans. The earth is the vessel...
3.1.2.8	He sprinkles the Brahmanas.
3.1.2.9	After the Brahmanas have eaten, he asks them to give their consent to the leftovers.
3.1.3.1	Taking a pitcher of water and a handful of darbha grass, he spreads the darbha grass with the tips towards the south. With his right hand facing downwards, he places three water pitchers above them, facing towards the south, and says: "May the ancestors be purified, may the grandfathers be purified, may great-grandfathers be purified."

Thine are the Sämans. Thy greatness.
3.2.4.2	This much is the rite of that day.
3.2.4.3	Now, those who knew this, the ancient sages, prepared a cake on eight potsherds and four cups of milk. By that they satisfied the Pitrs. They, being satisfied, satisfied them with offspring and cattle. Then they made friendship with the Pitrs, for all beings were friendly to them.
3.1.3.6	If one does not know the names, one gives the ball to the father with the words, "Svāhā to the fathers seated in the earth."
3.1.3.7	"Svāhā to grandfather, seated in the sky."

3.1.3.12	"These are your fathers' garments. Let the fathers not take them from us. These are your grandfathers' garments. Let not the grandfathers take them from us." Having cut off the ten locks of hair, he places them. Having cut off his own hair in the earlier part of his life, he places it in the later part.
3.2.5.2	Having offered the oblation for expiation, he offers the oblation for consecration.

3.2.5.3	Then he consecrates the cow to them, saying, "I consecrate this cow to you, O Fathers, as your own."
3.1.3.13	Then, having contracted the vessel, he says, "These waters, flowing with honey, are satisfying my sons and grandsons."

3.1.3.15	Having placed the vessel upside down and exchanging hands, he stands with six salutations, saying, "Salutations to you, O fathers, for the sake of life."
3.2.5.4	Then he sprinkles her with the formula, "I sprinkle thee for the Pitrs to be agreeable."
3.2.5.5	Here itself they make her lie down with her head towards the west and feet towards the south.
3.2.5.6	Having sprinkled her, he silently nourishes her with water.
3.2.5.7	Having taken out the omentum, he silently covers it with the grass.

May their wishes be fulfilled according to their desires. Svāhā to Svadhā and salutations."
3.1.3.16	Having gone to the water's edge, he offers water-libations three times with water-libations. This is your father's sweet wave of Sarasvati. As great as Agni and Earth are, so great is his measure, so great is its greatness. I give him this being as much as Agni is imperishable and uninterrupted, so may it be for your father, imperishable and uninterrupted. May you have the Svāhā. May you have Svāhā with the imperishable ones, together with those who live. The Ṛks are your greatness. This is your grandfather's sweet wave, as great as Vāyu and the atmosphere are, so great his measure, so much is its greatness.

3.1.3.17	This is thy great-grandfather, thy father's father. The sweet-flowing Sarasvati, as wide as the sun and the sky, is his measure, so great is his greatness. I give him to thee as a being, as the sun is imperishable and without decay. So may my great-grandfather, my father, be imperishable and without decline. May there be for him the Svāhā, the imperishable, together with them. May he live with thee. Thy greatness is the same as theirs.
3.2.6.2	She offers the second oblation. The wife of the year, being tormented by austerities, milked the swollen (cow) at the Ekastaka (rite). The fathers live on that milk which is being released in a thousand ways by desires. Svāhā to Svadhā!

3.2.1.3	Having placed the fire on the Anurādha asterism, having strewn (Darbha-grass), having gone round along the right side of the fire, he pours out the rice-grains through a single strainer. He pours out this cake on four potsherds for the Pitrs, for the removal of distress. "He says, "I pour out this oblation for the Pitrs in the impulse of Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, for the Pitrs who are dear to them." He pours out the cake on four potshers thus: "For the Pitrs, to the Pitrs."
3.2.6.12	Now, those who knew this, the ancient teachers, arranged the eight-fold cow in this way. With it they satisfied the ancestors. They, being satisfied, satisfied them with offspring and cattle. Then they made friendship with the ancestors, for all beings were friendly to them.
3.2.1.4	Having sprinkled silently, and having released the speech, he places the cake in the pot as he does the cake.
3.2.1.5	Or in one pot.
3.2.6.13	He who, knowing this, thus arranges this eight-fold cow,
3.2.6.14	he indeed satisfies the ancestors.
3.2.6.15	Those who are satisfied by him, satisfy with offspring and cattle.
3.2.6.16	Therefore he makes friendship with the ancestors, for all beings become his friends.
3.2.6.17	He who, knowing this thus arranges this eightfold cow,
3.2.1.6	Having poured it, he pours clarified butter and curds, and then sprinkles (the fire) with the formula, "O Aditi, do thou approve."

3.2.3.3	Having entered, he goes to the water and offers water libations with the water libation. This is your father's sweet wave, the one that flows. As great as Agni and the earth are, so great is his measure, so great is its greatness. I give him this existence as such. Just as Agni is imperishable and uninterrupted, so may my father be imperishable and uninterrupted. May you have the Svāhā. May you have Svāhā. The imperishable together with those who live together. The verses are your greatness.

3.2.6.2	She offers the second oblation. The wife of the year, being tormented by austerities, milked the swollen (cow) at the Ekastaka (rite). The fathers live on that milk which is being released in a thousand ways by desires. Svāhā to Svadhā!
3.3.2.9-12	He should recite the Rig and Yajur mantras related to the ancestors.

3.2.6.10	Having entered, having gone to the water, he offers water with the offering of water, saying, "This is for you, for your father."
3.2.6.11	This much is the rite for this day.
3.2.6.12	Now, those who knew this, the ancient teachers, arranged the eight-fold cow in this way. With it they satisfied the ancestors. They, being satisfied, satisfied them with offspring and cattle. Then they made friendship with the ancestors, for all beings were friendly to them.
3.4.1.2	In the case of a person who has kindled the sacred fires, or of one who has not kindled them, or of a woman, when there is doubt about death, in a clean and even place, having smeared it with cow-dung, having sprinkled it with sand, having spread darbha grass with their tips towards the south, having placed him with his head towards the south, the Brahmanas should be addressed with the following words: "May the life-breath be prolonged."
3.2.6.13	He who, knowing this, thus arranges this eight-fold cow,
3.2.6.14	he indeed satisfies the ancestors.
3.2.6.15	Those who are satisfied by him, satisfy with offspring and cattle.
3.2.6.16	Therefore he makes friendship with the ancestors, for all beings become his friends.
3.2.6.17	He who, knowing this thus arranges this eightfold cow,
3.4.1.3	Then, when the vital airs have departed, having turned his face towards the east, having placed a piece of gold in his mouth, having bound the thumb-band, having adorned himself with the village ornament, having covered himself with a new and unworn garment, having offered the evening oblation, having offered the morning oblation, having performed the Full Moon sacrifice, having performed the New Moon sacrifice, having melted the clarified butter in the Garhapatya fire, having purified it, having taken four spoonfuls, having turned towards the east, he offers on the Āhavanīya fire with the Samit-verse, "For the establishment of death, svāhā."

May their wishes be true. With desires, salutations, and Svāhā."
3.4.1.4	Having driven the four Brahmanas, having placed the face towards the village, having driven them towards the cremation ground, having taken the dead body to the cremation ground, and having placed it there with the fire, one should wait for the burning. It should be sloping towards the south or west, not uneven, not muddy, not hollow, and even.
3.2.7.2	He offers the second (oblation) with the verse, "The form of the year which the nights worship, having made the offspring and the best heroes, they enjoy the entire life with desires, with Svāhā and Namaḥ."
3.2.7.3	He offers the third (oblation) saying, "Which the people praise."
3.2.7.4	He offers fourth (oblation) to Prajapati.
3.2.7.5	He offers the fifth (oblation) by saying, "Whatever is the excess of his rite."
3.2.7.6-9	Having struck the ladle and sprinkled it, having given these balls of dough covered with dough, he touches them with the touch of faith, saying, "The earth is your vessel." He approaches the learned Brahmins. Having approached, he goes to the water and offers a water libation, saying, "This is yours."
3.2.7.10	This much is the rite of the day.
3.4.1.5	May those who have gone away, those who have not yet come, those who are here, the old and the new, be freed from the serpent. May Yama give him the end of his life, with the waters, the days, the oblations, and the clearings. Having rubbed the southern branch with a branch of the black fig tree or the jujube tree, and having removed it, having touched the water, having sprinkled it with water, having placed a piece of gold, having said, "Go away, O ghosts, all those who were here before, may they do us well. Let our tears not return." The southern direction is cleared. Having dug three furrows with a spade or an axe, having sprinkled them with water, having filled a handful of sesame and rice, he offers it to Yama, the lord of the dead, to the dead, with the words, "Svāhā, salutations to the dead." He offers it in the first furrow.
3.2.7.11	Now, those who knew this, the ancient scholars, arranged this food in eight portions. By that they satisfied the Pitrs. They, being satisfied, satisfied them with offspring and cattle. Then they made friendship with the Pitrs, for all beings were friendly to them. He who, knowing this, arranges this food in eight parts,
3.4.1.6	So also in the second and third.
3.4.1.7	If he is a householder with a fire altar, he should cut the black antelope skin and spread it with the right side facing up and the hair facing down.
3.4.1.8	At this time, having bathed in water and with herbs, he should fill a pot with it and bathe the one with ten sacrifices with it from a pot.
3.2.7.12	By that he satisfies the Pitrs.
3.2.7.13	Those who are satisfied by that, satisfy him with offspring and cattle.
3.2.7.14	Therefore he makes friends with the Pitrs. All beings become his friends.
3.4.1.9	Then having put on a new garment, and adorned himself, he should place the body on the pyre. Then he should place seven pieces of gold at the seven vital points, or drops of ghee if they are not available. First he should offer sesame seeds and rice mixed with ghee in the mouth, saying: "This is your body, this is your self, this is your Self, I separate the Self from the body. Earth, Heaven, Space, to that Heaven, to that world, Svāhā!"
3.2.7.15	One who knows this and gives food and wealth on the third day according to his faith, then for him there are unlimited food and wealth.
3.2.7.16	One who knows this and does not give food and wealth on third day according to one's faith, then for one there are unlimited food, wealth, but no cattle.

3.4.5.2	When the fire is not yet extinguished, he should take nine potfuls of water, go to the cremation ground, and with a Palāśa stake, or a Śamī stake, or an Udumbara stake, or with the thumb and little finger, or with all the fingers, collect the bones, sprinkle them with milk, and offer ghee, saying, "This is your body, this is your Self. I separate the Self from the body. Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Svaḥ, this is for the heaven world, svāhā."
3.4.5.3	If they do not burn, then taking a torch, he should burn again, saying, "You are born from this, he is born from you. To Agni Vaiśvānara, to the heavenly world, svāhā."
3.4.5.4	Then taking the bones, they should throw them in the banks of rivers or in the banks of the ocean.
3.4.1.5	May those who have gone away, those who have not yet come, those who are here, the old and the new, be freed from the serpent. May Yama give him the end of his life, with the waters, the days, the oblations, and the clearings. Having rubbed the southern branch with a branch of the black fig tree or the jujube tree, and having removed it, having touched the water, having sprinkled it with water, having placed a piece of gold, having said, "Go away, O ghosts, all those who were here before, may they do us well. Let our tears not return." The southern direction is cleared. Having dug three furrows with a spade or an axe, having sprinkled them with water, having filled a handful of sesame and rice, he offers it to Yama, the lord of the dead, to the dead, with the words, "Svāhā, salutations to the dead." He offers it in the first furrow.
3.4.5.5	Or else, having dug a pit the size of an elephant or a man, and having placed the pot of bones, and having smeared it again with dung, one should fill it up. As much as it is, so much one is honoured in heaven.
3.4.1.6	So also in the second and third.
3.4.1.7	If he is a householder with a fire altar, he should cut the black antelope skin and spread it with the right side facing up and the hair facing down.
3.4.1.8	At this time, having bathed in water and with herbs, he should fill a pot with it and bathe the one with ten sacrifices with it from a pot.
3.5.1.1	If a householder who has established the sacred fires goes away, either to be cured or because of old age, they should arrange his bed in the Agniṣṭha fire-chamber or at the place of sacrifice for the sacrificer, with his feet towards the Gārhapatya.
3.5.1.2	They bring him food, as much as he thinks is enough for a meal.
3.5.1.3	If he is sick, he returns.
3.5.1.4	If he does not return, they do not pour milk.
3.4.1.9	Then having put on a new garment, and adorned himself, he should place the body on the pyre. Then he should place seven pieces of gold at the seven vital points, or drops of ghee if they are not available. First he should offer sesame seeds and rice mixed with ghee in the mouth, saying: "This is your body, this is your self, this is your Self, I separate the Self from the body. Earth, Heaven, Space, to that Heaven, to that world, Svāhā!"
3.5.1.5	Now the teachers say that the Agnihotra is to be commenced in the evening and concluded in the morning.
3.5.1.6	Here they quote:
3.5.1.7	If one dies after offering the Agnihotra in the evening, one should offer the Agnihotra in morning after having brought back the fire.
3.5.1.8	If one dies in the morning after offering the Agnihotras, it is good.
3.5.1.9	Now these two, the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa, are the rites of the Full Moon and New Moon. The teachers say:
3.5.1.10	Here they quote:
3.5.1.11	If one dies after the Full Moon, one should perform the New Moon rite after making amends.
3.5.1.12	If one is well after the New Moon,
3.5.1.13	If both Parvanis have passed for one, one should perform an expiation for the transgression.
3.5.1.14	Now if the Agnihotra of one in distress is interrupted, if his son or pupil is capable of performing the rites, he should set up the fire on the kindling woods, perform the Udasvayam, and having performed the rites, offer a cake on eight potshards to Agni Tantumati.
3.5.1.15	He gives a pot as Dakṣiṇā.
3.5.1.16	The Iṣṭi is concluded.
3.4.1.10-12	The Hotr, the Dakshina Hotr, the Maitravaruna, the Brhaddhvar, the Prastotri, the Udgatrs, the Pratihartr, the Subrahmanya, the Neshthya, the Ashvin, the Adhvaryu, the Pratiprasthttr, the Acchhavasya, the Agnidhra, the Soshthya, the Potr, the Neshtri, the Pratihartri, the Upagantri, the Upabarha, the Upavasya, the Upavyacha, the Upaghoshaka, the Upabhartr, the Upagrayan, the Upakraman, the Upakarman, the Uparatrin, the Upavargayan, the Upavartman, the Upayachan, the Upayojan, the Upahrdayan, the Uparishyan, the Uparivartman, the Upariyojan, the Upasthayan, the Uparayayan, the Uparasayan, the Uparamapan, the Uparasadan, the Uparasan, the Uparashan, the Uparaghoshan, the Uparapran, the Uparavasan, the Upavachan, the Uparamayan, the Uparasaman
3.5.1.17	When the sun has set, they should silently perform this ritual. Having established the ritual, they should consume the food and drink.
3.5.1.18	It is known that they consume the food and drinks.
3.5.1.19	Then, having taken him, they should lead him northwards between the two lightning-producing clouds, and then they should cover him.
3.5.1.20	They make the southern door for him.
3.4.1.13	The four Hotars, the earth is the Hotar, twice on the two corners of the mouth. The five Hotars, Agni is the Hotar; twice on the two ears. The six Hotars, the sun is the Hotar. Twice on the two cheeks. The seven Hotars, the great oblation is the Hotar.
3.5.1.21	Then having shaved his hair and beard, and having removed the body-hair, he should cut his nails.
3.5.1.22	Then having drawn his right side, and having made it free from excreta, he should wash it with water, and having filled the intestines with ghee, he should sew it with darbha-grass.
3.5.1.23	It is known that if he does so, his progeny will be hungry.
3.4.2.1	Then he takes up the clarified butter for the oblations, silently, in the Juhu vessel, curds in the Upabhuj vessel, honey and clarified butter in the Dhruva vessel, milk in the Agnihotra vessel.
3.4.2.2	Or he may take up clarified butter in all the vessels.
3.4.2.3	Here he arranges the vessels.
3.5.1.24	Or else, having covered it with the excrement, having adorned it, having taken it, having placed it between the two fires, having placed it in the rear of the Garhapatya, saying, "The oblation is offered here."
3.5.1.25	Having taken it, they place it on the inner part of the altar, with the head towards the east, saying, "Here the oblation is placed."
3.4.2.4	The vessels that are to be filled with water are filled and sprinkled. The others are known to be not empty.
3.4.2.5	He places the ladle and the digging stick in his right hand.
3.5.1.26	Then having melted the clarified butter in the Garhapatya fire, having purified it, having taken four spoonfuls in the ladle, having gone forward, having offered the Samit on the Ahavaniya fire, then having taken hold of his right arm, he offers.
3.4.2.6	The Upabhṛt ladle is placed on the chest, the Dhruva ladle on the neck, the Aranis on the mouth, the Agnihotra ladle on the nose, the two ladles for pouring clarified butter on the ears, the Praśitra ladle on the teeth, having broken them into one each.
3.4.2.7	The stones are placed on the heels.
3.4.2.8	The skull is placed on the head.
3.5.2.1	The path of many, the path of the departed, the path of those who have gone before, the path of Yama, the path of Vaivasvata, the path of all men, the path of many, which is not seen, the path of men to meet, the king Yama, they worship with oblations. Svāhā.
3.5.2.2	One offers on the Garhapatya fire with this (verse).
3.4.2.9	The skull on the forehead, the pot of flour in the belly, the vessel of ghee at the navel, the ladle to be taken up, the stool to be placed near, the stool to put on the head, the winnowing basket at the sides, the two lumps of dough to be cut and placed at the nostrils, the pot of cooked rice, the two lumps to be placed at the testicles, the bull's horn and the pestle at the back, the Agnihotra vessel, the Anvähäryä vessel, the Idä vessel, the Veda at the tuft.
3.5.2.3	Having silently offered to the Anvāhāryapacana fire, he takes it and places it between the Vedi and the Utkara. Having placed it behind the Garhapatya, on the skin of a black antelope, with the head towards the south, he puts on the head a garland of Nalada flowers and covers it with a new and unworn garment, saying, "This is the first garment that has come to you." Then he removes it, saying, "Remove this, what you feared here before. Seeing the fulfilled and unfulfilled, as your gift was given in many ways to your relatives."
3.4.2.10	Or else, he puts the remaining bones between the two thighs.
3.4.2.11	His relatives cover him with the skin of a black antelope, with the neck towards the south and with the hair towards the north, and then they bind him with the Sigvātā.
3.4.2.12	There are three Sigvātās: in the village, on the path and on the funeral pyre.
3.5.2.4	His son, or his pupil, or his wife should keep it.
3.5.2.5	He should keep it for a night or for a day.
3.5.2.6	Then he prepares three pieces of wood.
3.5.2.7	If there are no pieces of wood, then on the inner side of the altar, he cooks three pot-herbs in the Anvāhāryapachana vessel, or one pot-herb, of black grains, cut and thrown away.
3.4.2.13	May the winds blow along your path, fragrant, pleasing to the mind, pleasing to the body, favorable, pleasant to the skin, pleasant to the flesh, pleasant to the bones. May the Maruts carry you to the place where the worlds are well-made.
3.5.2.8	He cooks the milk-rice on the Garhapatya fire.
3.5.2.9	Then he prepares the following requisites: curds mixed with ghee, ghee, a pot of water, Darbha grass for spreading, gold, a ladle, a spoon, a ladle for pouring, a pot, a pot for pouring, sand, three kinds of stone, and three kinds of leaves.
3.5.2.10	How can they burn him?"
3.4.3.1	If the sacrificer is a householder, then having released the thumb-bandage with the verse, "May it cleanse our sin", the Adhvaryu or the Sviṣṭakṛt, having placed the pot of water on the head, sprinkles it three times moving towards the left.
3.4.3.2	He strikes it a little with an axe.
3.5.2.11	If one were to perform many sacrifices, they should cremate him with the eastern fire. This is one view.
3.5.2.12	They should cremate him continuously. This is one opinion.
3.5.2.13	They should burn him with the fire produced by friction. This is one option.
3.4.3.3	Then he recites over the stream of water, "These waters are sweet, may they be milked in this world."
3.4.3.4	When the second (stream) has passed, he strikes (the ground) behind, "These waters which are sweet, may be milked in the sky."
3.5.2.14	Or else, having kindled three fires of straw, they should take a torch from where the fires meet and burn him with it. This is one other thing.
3.5.3.1	Now, the rules for the Anuṣṭaraṇī.
3.5.3.2	They bring her, the black, the crooked, the old, the foolish, the lowest, the Anuṣṭaṇī, the bound.
3.4.3.5	He strikes the third time when the woman has gone away, saying, "These waters are sweet, may they be milked for you in heaven."
3.4.3.6	He breaks the pot.
3.4.3.7	If it falls forward, he becomes worse; if it falls backward, he becomes better.
3.4.3.8	Then he pours the water remaining in the pot into the places of the dead man's vital airs, saying, "Born in heaven, born in water."
3.5.3.3	It is understood that she is bound on the left side.
3.5.3.4	At this time, his ministers, with dishevelled hair, strike her with three fingers and sprinkle dust on their shoulders, saying, "May his sin not be ours!"
3.4.3.9	He offers the plants to the constellation Ārdrā.
3.4.3.10	He sees a cow.
3.4.3.11	He sees Brahmins.
3.4.3.12	He offers gold.
3.4.3.13	Here he gives a gift to the teacher.
3.5.3.5	Then his wives, the youngest and the eldest, with their hair dishevelled, would go to the fields, scattering dust on their shoulders, saying, "It is not his sin, it is the sin of the plough."
3.5.3.6	At this time, a Palasa wood is heated on the Garhapatya fire, and then the first torches are taken up.
3.4.4.1	Then the Adhvaryu lights the Āhavanīya fire in the southeast, the Anvāhāryapacaniya in the southwest, the Gārhapatya in the northwest, and the Sabhya and Avaskya fires in the north.
3.4.4.2	One should fast with the Agni, Yajus, Patnī, Sena, and Indra mantras.
3.5.3.7	Then the sacrificial grass, then the fires, then the vessels, then ghee, then the darbha grass, then the cow from a royal family.
3.5.3.8	Then, having wrapped him in a bed or a mat with this evening prayer, slaves or old men should carry him.
3.5.3.9	Some say that they carry him with the evening prayer.
3.5.3.10	If he does not yoke, he yokes them with the formula, "I yoke these two fires for the carrying of the Asuras, by which one goes to Yama's abode and also to the well-done world." Having placed the fires, they are carried.
3.5.3.11	Having placed the fires, or having made a passage between them, they are carried
3.5.4.1	Then he takes it.
3.4.4.3	With the verses, "O Vācaspati, O Vidhi, O Vācaspati! By the power of speech, Soma! O Vācaspate, with the unbroken speech, O Vācaśpate, O Hṛddhe, O Namna!" - with these verses, the Vāghotrīya recites. With the verse, "This is the Brahman, the one Hotṛ," he stands up.
3.4.4.4	The Āhavanīya is a skull for some.
3.4.4.5	The Vājasaneyins recite with the Santāpana Agni.
3.5.4.2	He recites the formula, "Pūṣan, the knower, may he separate this (animal) from here. The protector of the world, having cattle not lost, he gives it to these fathers, Agni to the gods, to the well-knowing ones."
3.5.4.3	Having gone to the third stage of this path, they place it.
3.5.4.4	Then with a piece of wood without a blade, he cuts one of these pieces.
3.5.4.5	If they are not pieces, then he offers the rice-ball with a spoon.
3.5.4.6	Or if it is one, then he offers a third part of the rice-ball.
3.5.4.7	Having collected the clods, having rubbed them, the youngest and the eldest with loose hair, go around three times in the opposite direction, blowing with the wind.
3.4.4.6	May he return to you, O Agni, whom the heat and the fire have seized, the path that the heroes of battle go to, free from sin, free from grief, free from sorrow, may you go to that path, O Agni, the one in heaven, the one in the sky, the one in space, the one in water, the one in earth, the one in plants, the one in food, the one in fire, the one in wind, the one in light, the one in darkness, the one in day, the one in night, the one in dawn, the one in evening, the one in morning, the one in noon, the one in twilight, the one in all beings, the one in everything, the one in every direction, the one in this world, the one in yonder world, the one who is the one, the one who knows the one, the supreme one, the one in whom all beings are one, the one without a second, the one who has no second, the one without an equal, the one who
3.5.4.8	Thus the ministers, thus the women, having bound their hair, go around three times in the same way.
3.5.4.9	Then they take it up.
3.5.4.10	While being taken up, he recites: "May Pūṣan follow all these directions. May he lead us to the safest place, the giver of well-being, the one without enmity, the hero of all, the one without fear, the one who goes to the city, the one who knows."
3.4.4.7	If he is not one who has kindled the sacred fire, then may he go to the world of those who have given up their bodies in battle, of those who know the way to liberation, of those who are wise, of those who have performed good deeds, of those who offer oblations to Agni, of those who go to heaven, of those who enjoy the world of the ancestors. May he go to the place of those who know about the world of the fathers.
3.5.4.11	Having gone half the distance of this path, they place it down.
3.5.4.12	Then, with one of these pieces, he cuts with a knife.
3.5.4.13	If there are no pieces, he cuts the rice with a bamboo stick.
3.5.4.14	Having collected the clods, they rub them together and scatter their hair, the youngest first. They go around three times counterclockwise, blowing with their mouths.
3.4.4.8	Then, having made peace with the formula, "I sprinkle you with the Yajus, wearing the sacrificial thread," he stands before the sun with the Jyotishmati (hymn), "We rise above darkness, we rise above the gloom."
3.4.4.9	Sons, brothers, and relatives sit together.
3.4.4.10	They come to the sacred place without looking back.
3.5.4.15	Thus the ministers, thus the women, having bound their hair, go around three times in the same way.
3.5.4.16	Then they take it up.
3.5.4.17	While being taken up, he recites this verse: "May life, may universal life protect you. May Pūṣan protect you on the path ahead, where the virtuous ones dwell, where they have gone, may the god Savitā place you there."
3.4.4.11	Or a royal official or a person of the same clan may stop them with a leaf, a branch of the śamī tree, or a branch of the udumbara tree, saying, "Do not cross."
3.5.4.18	Having gone through the entire ritual, they place it down.
3.5.4.19	Then, of these pieces, one is cut with a knife.
3.5.4.20	If there are no pieces, he offers the rice-gruel with a ladle.
3.5.4.21	If there is only one, he offers the remaining rice-gruel from the pot with a ladle.
3.4.4.12	Having said, "We shall not return again," and having made the signs of the sick, having let down their hair, having sprinkled themselves with dust, having put on a single garment or an unwashed garment, facing south, having emerged once after submerging, having placed the left knee on the ground, having pressed the garment, having risen, having taken water in a joined palm, mixed with sesame, towards the west, saying, "This is your water," having done so a second and third time, then they come to the village without waiting.
3.5.4.22	Having collected the clods of earth, having rubbed them together, the youngest and the eldest, with their hair let loose, go round three times to the left, blowing with the Sigb-s.
3.5.4.23	Thus the ministers and the women, having bound their hair, go round three more times in the same way.
3.5.4.24	Then he breaks this pot of cooked rice into many pieces, so that water does not stand in its fragments.
3.5.4.25	And what the women say here, they do.
3.5.5.1	Then he makes room for her.
3.4.4.13	The ants go in the order of their size.
3.4.4.14	Having eaten a neem leaf at the door of the house, having sipped water, having touched cowdung, gold, water, fire, mustard seeds, and oil, having touched the head, having touched the vital airs, having stepped on a stone, having entered the house, they do what the women say.
3.5.5.2	Then, water which is not saline, not injured, not flowing, not muddy, not turbid, not with anthills, not with sleeping places, where the trees are milky, and the plants are mixed, from which water flows gently towards the south and the west, and then, having turned to the right, reaches the great river, and becomes eastern.
3.4.4.15	When the breath has gone out, he should smear the place with cow-dung, install the calf, scatter sesame seeds and rice mixed with water, and say, "May the houses be well! May the remaining be peaceful!" Having performed the wind-ritual, he should eat uncooked food. After that, he should observe celibacy for ten nights.
3.5.5.3	Some say that it is sloping towards the south and west.
3.5.5.4	Or else, it is a level ground.
3.5.5.5	Therefore, they extract herbs from it.
3.5.5.6	And the plants such as Kalama, Prisniparni, Tivaka, Apaghna, Apaamargaka, Shunti, Bahuputrika, Visrasinika, Rajakshapani, and other milky plants.
3.4.4.16	Having sipped water once in the evening and morning, on the tenth day, having sipped water thrice, on the tenth, one should eat in a modified way.
3.4.5.1	Now we shall explain the collection of bones.
3.5.5.7	Then having lifted him up and sprinkled him with gold, he removes him with a leaf-branch, reciting, "Go away, depart, go away, O serpent."
3.5.5.8	They make it of wood, facing south. This is known as the direction of the ancestors.
3.5.5.9	Having made a fire-place in the south-east corner of the cremation ground, having spread Darbha grass around the fire, the dead body and the cremation ground, and having spread Darbha grasses in the south of the fire-place, he places the vessels one by one on them.
3.4.5.2	When the fire is not yet extinguished, he should take nine potfuls of water, go to the cremation ground, and with a Palāśa stake, or a Śamī stake, or an Udumbara stake, or with the thumb and little finger, or with all the fingers, collect the bones, sprinkle them with milk, and offer ghee, saying, "This is your body, this is your Self. I separate the Self from the body. Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Svaḥ, this is for the heaven world, svāhā."
3.4.5.3	If they do not burn, then taking a torch, he should burn again, saying, "You are born from this, he is born from you. To Agni Vaiśvānara, to the heavenly world, svāhā."
3.4.5.4	Then taking the bones, they should throw them in the banks of rivers or in the banks of the ocean.
3.4.5.5	Or else, having dug a pit the size of an elephant or a man, and having placed the pot of bones, and having smeared it again with dung, one should fill it up. As much as it is, so much one is honoured in heaven.
3.5.6.2	When she is about to lie down, she presses her knees against the man's knees. We have removed the dirt of the man and woman. May no one else come before us in old age."
3.5.6.3	Here they kill her with a weapon.
3.5.6.4	Then he recites the following verse to the vital airs of the person which are being released: "I have released your vital air, O man, in the body. Come to the earth, come to the fathers. Bring us here with offspring."
3.5.1.1	If a householder who has established the sacred fires goes away, either to be cured or because of old age, they should arrange his bed in the Agniṣṭha fire-chamber or at the place of sacrifice for the sacrificer, with his feet towards the Gārhapatya.
3.5.1.2	They bring him food, as much as he thinks is enough for a meal.
3.5.1.3	If he is sick, he returns.
3.5.1.4	If he does not return, they do not pour milk.
3.5.6.5	Having risen, they remove the dust. "May I not be hurt! I am the beloved, the true goddess. When the two worlds are destroyed by the wind, may both worlds be covered with milk."
3.5.1.5	Now the teachers say that the Agnihotra is to be commenced in the evening and concluded in the morning.
3.5.1.6	Here they quote:
3.5.1.7	If one dies after offering the Agnihotra in the evening, one should offer the Agnihotra in morning after having brought back the fire.
3.5.1.8	If one dies in the morning after offering the Agnihotras, it is good.
3.5.6.6	Then he instructs him: "Having cut off the flesh from the limbs, except for the bones, and having not uttered any sound, and not thrown it away, and having cooked it in a single pot, he should place the known fat, the known heart, the known tongue, the known skin, with the head, beard, and feet, in the known stream of urine, and the known marrow."
3.5.6.7	Then he makes his wife lie down, saying, "This woman, seeking the world of her husband, lies down; may she, following thee, O mortal, the ancient, the universal, protect thee. May she here have offspring and wealth."
3.5.1.9	Now these two, the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa, are the rites of the Full Moon and New Moon. The teachers say:
3.5.1.10	Here they quote:
3.5.1.11	If one dies after the Full Moon, one should perform the New Moon rite after making amends.
3.5.1.12	If one is well after the New Moon,
3.5.1.13	If both Parvanis have passed for one, one should perform an expiation for the transgression.
3.5.6.8	Holding her by the left hand, he makes her rise, saying, "Rise up, O woman, and live; this is the last of your dead. Come, thou art taken by the hand of the one who desires thee. This is thy husband's duty, thou hast attained it."
3.5.1.14	Now if the Agnihotra of one in distress is interrupted, if his son or pupil is capable of performing the rites, he should set up the fire on the kindling woods, perform the Udasvayam, and having performed the rites, offer a cake on eight potshards to Agni Tantumati.
3.5.1.15	He gives a pot as Dakṣiṇā.
3.5.1.16	The Iṣṭi is concluded.
3.5.6.9	Then he wipes his hands with gold, taking from the hands of the dead, for prosperity, for Brahman, for splendour, for strength. Herein thou art, here we are, well-favoured. May we conquer all our foes and overcome our enemies. Thus the Brahman takes the bow from the hands of a dead man, for prosperity, strength, for the Kshatriya, for strength. Thus the Rajanya takes the gem from the hands of one dead, for prosperity of the community, for nourishment, for strength.
3.5.1.17	When the sun has set, they should silently perform this ritual. Having established the ritual, they should consume the food and drink.
3.5.1.18	It is known that they consume the food and drinks.
3.5.1.19	Then, having taken him, they should lead him northwards between the two lightning-producing clouds, and then they should cover him.
3.5.1.20	They make the southern door for him.
3.5.6.10-14	And what the women say here, they do. Then he places him on the funeral pyre with the wooden stool. Pulling out the rope, they throw away the wooden stool. The dead man lies on the black antelope skin and the rope. On his vital airs he places pieces of gold.
3.5.1.21	Then having shaved his hair and beard, and having removed the body-hair, he should cut his nails.
3.5.1.22	Then having drawn his right side, and having made it free from excreta, he should wash it with water, and having filled the intestines with ghee, he should sew it with darbha-grass.
3.5.1.23	It is known that if he does so, his progeny will be hungry.
3.5.6.15	He offers with two spoonfuls of the oblation-material taken in the ladle, with the two half-verses, "The variegated army of the gods has risen up." It is understood that he offers with the two half verses.
3.5.7.1	How should he join the vessels?
3.5.1.24	Or else, having covered it with the excrement, having adorned it, having taken it, having placed it between the two fires, having placed it in the rear of the Garhapatya, saying, "The oblation is offered here."
3.5.1.25	Having taken it, they place it on the inner part of the altar, with the head towards the east, saying, "Here the oblation is placed."
3.5.1.26	Then having melted the clarified butter in the Garhapatya fire, having purified it, having taken four spoonfuls in the ladle, having gone forward, having offered the Samit on the Ahavaniya fire, then having taken hold of his right arm, he offers.
3.5.7.2	Having filled the mouth with a ladle of clarified butter mixed with curds, having placed the two ladles in the nostrils, having placed the pieces of gold in the eyes, or having placed the two spoons of clarified butter in the ears, having broken the Prastara and having placed one each in the cheeks, having placed the pestle and mortar on the head, having placed the skull on the forehead, having placed the Ekakapala on the head, and having placed the Praṇītā vessel, he places the vessel saying, "O Agni, do not burn this vessel. It is dear to the gods and also to the gentle ones. This is the vessel for drinking by the gods, in which the gods may be pleased with nectar."
3.5.2.1	The path of many, the path of the departed, the path of those who have gone before, the path of Yama, the path of Vaivasvata, the path of all men, the path of many, which is not seen, the path of men to meet, the king Yama, they worship with oblations. Svāhā.
3.5.2.2	One offers on the Garhapatya fire with this (verse).
3.5.7.3	In the right hand he places the Juhu, in the left the Upamant, on the chest the Dhruva, the Upavesha, the Aranis, on the right shoulder the Meshan, on the left the Pisht-udvani, on the back the Spha, on the belly the wooden vessel, on the belly two bowls, the covering of the Sannayy, the carrying of the Ced, on the flanks the Sannayy-pot, on the feet the Agnihotra-pot, on both thighs the Anv-aharya-pot, on his knees the mortar and pestle, on the testicles the stone for grinding, on the penis the Vrishavaran, the Shamia, on the sides the sieve, having cut it into pieces, he places the head of the sieve, the Kurch, which is to be placed near.
3.5.2.3	Having silently offered to the Anvāhāryapacana fire, he takes it and places it between the Vedi and the Utkara. Having placed it behind the Garhapatya, on the skin of a black antelope, with the head towards the south, he puts on the head a garland of Nalada flowers and covers it with a new and unworn garment, saying, "This is the first garment that has come to you." Then he removes it, saying, "Remove this, what you feared here before. Seeing the fulfilled and unfulfilled, as your gift was given in many ways to your relatives."
3.5.7.4-9	The wooden foot-rest is to be used for the feet. The remaining (articles) are to be placed between the knees. The wooden articles are to be used for water. It is understood that the wooden articles are to used for water. Here they are to be placed. They should give the articles made of iron and copper to the Brahmanas.
3.5.2.4	His son, or his pupil, or his wife should keep it.
3.5.2.5	He should keep it for a night or for a day.
3.5.2.6	Then he prepares three pieces of wood.
3.5.2.7	If there are no pieces of wood, then on the inner side of the altar, he cooks three pot-herbs in the Anvāhāryapachana vessel, or one pot-herb, of black grains, cut and thrown away.
3.5.7.10	Those which are moist, he should fill with curds mixed with ghee.
3.5.7.11	He should touch the others.
3.5.7.12	It is known that they are not empty.
3.5.7.13	Here itself, they put the Upavajinam, the Kharī, and the Nalva.
3.5.7.14	Then, having taken out the Amikṣā, he should place it in his hands, saying, "For Mitra and Varuna you."
3.5.2.8	He cooks the milk-rice on the Garhapatya fire.
3.5.2.9	Then he prepares the following requisites: curds mixed with ghee, ghee, a pot of water, Darbha grass for spreading, gold, a ladle, a spoon, a ladle for pouring, a pot, a pot for pouring, sand, three kinds of stone, and three kinds of leaves.
3.5.2.10	How can they burn him?"
3.5.2.11	If one were to perform many sacrifices, they should cremate him with the eastern fire. This is one view.
3.5.2.12	They should cremate him continuously. This is one opinion.
3.5.2.13	They should burn him with the fire produced by friction. This is one option.
3.5.7.15	Then, having written his name on it, he should place it in his hands, saying, "With the dark and strong ones."
3.5.7.16	On the right hand, the right; on the left hand, the left; on the heart, the heart; on the mouth, the tongue; on the limbs, the limbs. Having covered the other parts, he covers the mouth with the fat.
3.5.7.17	It is known that he sprinkles the ladle with fat.
3.5.2.14	Or else, having kindled three fires of straw, they should take a torch from where the fires meet and burn him with it. This is one other thing.
3.5.3.1	Now, the rules for the Anuṣṭaraṇī.
3.5.3.2	They bring her, the black, the crooked, the old, the foolish, the lowest, the Anuṣṭaṇī, the bound.
3.5.7.18	Then he covers him with a skin, with hair upwards, with the head and feet, with the words, "O Agni, thou art covered with the cows, be covered with the fat and marrow. Thou, the drinker, the strong, the vigorous, the destroyer, the burning, art covered with the skin."
3.5.8.1	If they do not cover it with the covering-cloth, he should discard it.
3.5.3.3	It is understood that she is bound on the left side.
3.5.3.4	At this time, his ministers, with dishevelled hair, strike her with three fingers and sprinkle dust on their shoulders, saying, "May his sin not be ours!"
3.5.8.2	Or he may give it to Brahmanas.
3.5.8.3	Having given it, one comes to know that they become prosperous here itself.
3.5.8.4	If he is going to release it, he should lead it around in a counter-clockwise direction with the verse, "We see the young woman moving around." He should lead it around three times with this verse three times. Then he should lead it towards the north and establish it there, reciting the verse, "Those who are living and those who are dead."
3.5.3.5	Then his wives, the youngest and the eldest, with their hair dishevelled, would go to the fields, scattering dust on their shoulders, saying, "It is not his sin, it is the sin of the plough."
3.5.3.6	At this time, a Palasa wood is heated on the Garhapatya fire, and then the first torches are taken up.
3.5.8.5	Then, having plucked out the hairs of her ears, he should place them on her hands, saying, "With the dark and tawny ones."
3.5.8.6	The right one on the right, the left one on the left.
3.5.3.7	Then the sacrificial grass, then the fires, then the vessels, then ghee, then the darbha grass, then the cow from a royal family.
3.5.3.8	Then, having wrapped him in a bed or a mat with this evening prayer, slaves or old men should carry him.
3.5.3.9	Some say that they carry him with the evening prayer.
3.5.8.7	Then she releases her, saying, "The daughter of the Rudras, the sister of the Vasus, the navel of the Adityas, I proclaim to you, O healer, for the people. Do not drink the water, do not eat the grass. O Aditi, do not drink the water. Drink the water. Eat the grass. O Agni, do not drink. Drink the water."
3.5.3.10	If he does not yoke, he yokes them with the formula, "I yoke these two fires for the carrying of the Asuras, by which one goes to Yama's abode and also to the well-done world." Having placed the fires, they are carried.
3.5.3.11	Having placed the fires, or having made a passage between them, they are carried
3.5.4.1	Then he takes it.
3.5.8.8	Then he makes him fast, first with the Āhavanīya, then with the Anvāhāryapacana, then with the Garhapatya, then with both the Sabhya and Avaskhya fires.
3.5.8.9	Here also there is a conjecture.
3.5.8.10	If the Āhavanīyī fire were to blaze first, one should know that he has gone to the world of gods.
3.5.4.2	He recites the formula, "Pūṣan, the knower, may he separate this (animal) from here. The protector of the world, having cattle not lost, he gives it to these fathers, Agni to the gods, to the well-knowing ones."
3.5.4.3	Having gone to the third stage of this path, they place it.
3.5.4.4	Then with a piece of wood without a blade, he cuts one of these pieces.
3.5.8.11	If the Anvāhāryapacana fire goes to the world of the Fathers,
3.5.8.12	if the Garhapatya fire goes to the heavenly world,
3.5.8.13	if the Sabhya and Avaskas fires go to the world of seven sages,
3.5.8.14	if all the fires together go up in flames, one should know that they have gone to the world of Brahma.
3.5.8.15	Whatever women say here, they do.
3.5.4.5	If they are not pieces, then he offers the rice-ball with a spoon.
3.5.4.6	Or if it is one, then he offers a third part of the rice-ball.
3.5.4.7	Having collected the clods, having rubbed them, the youngest and the eldest with loose hair, go around three times in the opposite direction, blowing with the wind.
3.6.1.1	Then he lights it.
3.6.1.2	While being lighted, he recites the formula, "O Agni, do not burn him. Do not grieve. Do not burn his skin. Do not burn the body. When you have cooked him, O Jātavedas, then send him to the Fathers."
3.6.1.3	When thou, O Jātavedas, dost make it boil, then thou givest it to the Fathers. When he goes beyond this ill-omened one, then he becomes obedient to the Gods.
3.5.4.8	Thus the ministers, thus the women, having bound their hair, go around three times in the same way.
3.5.4.9	Then they take it up.
3.5.4.10	While being taken up, he recites: "May Pūṣan follow all these directions. May he lead us to the safest place, the giver of well-being, the one without enmity, the hero of all, the one without fear, the one who goes to the city, the one who knows."
3.6.1.4	Here he explains the six Hotr-s. "Let your eye go to the sun, let your body go to the wind, go to heaven and earth with righteousness. Go to the waters, if that is good for you. Stand in the plants with your bodies."
3.5.4.11	Having gone half the distance of this path, they place it down.
3.5.4.12	Then, with one of these pieces, he cuts with a knife.
3.5.4.13	If there are no pieces, he cuts the rice with a bamboo stick.
3.5.4.14	Having collected the clods, they rub them together and scatter their hair, the youngest first. They go around three times counterclockwise, blowing with their mouths.
3.6.1.5	Here he binds him with a sharp arrow at the end of the altar, saying, "The goat is the share, do thou burn him with austerity. May thy lustre burn him, may thy flame burn him. Thy auspicious forms, O Jātavedas, by them may we go to the well-done worlds where are the worlds."
3.6.1.6	If he runs away, he does not turn him back.
3.6.1.7	Some indeed do it before fasting.
3.5.4.15	Thus the ministers, thus the women, having bound their hair, go around three times in the same way.
3.5.4.16	Then they take it up.
3.5.4.17	While being taken up, he recites this verse: "May life, may universal life protect you. May Pūṣan protect you on the path ahead, where the virtuous ones dwell, where they have gone, may the god Savitā place you there."
3.6.1.8	With a pitcher of water, they go around three times in the opposite direction with the Varuni verses.
3.6.1.9	Then, covering it with a leaf-made ladle, he offers the oblation with the verse, "To those who are the protectors of this path, svāhā." He offers nine oblations with the ladle.
3.5.4.18	Having gone through the entire ritual, they place it down.
3.5.4.19	Then, of these pieces, one is cut with a knife.
3.5.4.20	If there are no pieces, he offers the rice-gruel with a ladle.
3.5.4.21	If there is only one, he offers the remaining rice-gruel from the pot with a ladle.
3.6.1.10	Then he offers to another (fire). "This is thee; thou art above this. This is thy womb. This is thy son, the all-consuming fire, the creator of the world, the knower of beings. May he carry us to the good deeds, to the worlds where are the good deeds. Svāhā."
3.6.1.11	Here only he strikes with the ladle.
3.5.4.22	Having collected the clods of earth, having rubbed them together, the youngest and the eldest, with their hair let loose, go round three times to the left, blowing with the Sigb-s.
3.5.4.23	Thus the ministers and the women, having bound their hair, go round three more times in the same way.
3.5.4.24	Then he breaks this pot of cooked rice into many pieces, so that water does not stand in its fragments.
3.5.4.25	And what the women say here, they do.
3.5.5.1	Then he makes room for her.
3.6.1.12	Here he offers the oblations on the Iḍa-wood, covering them with the Udumbara-wood. He offers with the formula, "To Agni, the bestower of wealth, svāhā."
3.6.1.13	Here only he strikes the ladle with the ladle, with the back towards the fire.
3.6.1.14	Then he worships him with the hymn of Yama, consisting of nine verses, with the verse, "Agni shines brightly, the herald, the great one."
3.6.1.15	Sitting down, he recites the verses in reverse order.
3.5.5.2	Then, water which is not saline, not injured, not flowing, not muddy, not turbid, not with anthills, not with sleeping places, where the trees are milky, and the plants are mixed, from which water flows gently towards the south and the west, and then, having turned to the right, reaches the great river, and becomes eastern.
3.6.1.16	The three Dakshina-courses are drawn with the fire-place at the rear.
3.6.1.17	Having sprinkled them with water, they cover them with sand and collect them, the younger ones collecting before the elder ones.
3.6.1.18	"O ye who have the stone, ye who have the Reva, collect yourselves; rise up, O friends, and cross over. Here we leave those who are not with us. May we go to the auspicious prizes."
3.5.5.3	Some say that it is sloping towards the south and west.
3.5.5.4	Or else, it is a level ground.
3.5.5.5	Therefore, they extract herbs from it.
3.5.5.6	And the plants such as Kalama, Prisniparni, Tivaka, Apaghna, Apaamargaka, Shunti, Bahuputrika, Visrasinika, Rajakshapani, and other milky plants.
3.5.5.7	Then having lifted him up and sprinkled him with gold, he removes him with a leaf-branch, reciting, "Go away, depart, go away, O serpent."
3.5.5.8	They make it of wood, facing south. This is known as the direction of the ancestors.
3.6.1.19	Having bound the weak one with a stone, they creep away. The weak one is the one who is not able to move. The stone is the one who moves. The weak one moves away. The one who moves is the one who does not move. The one who does not know is the one who knows. The one who knows is the one who has knowledge. The one who has knowledge is the one who possesses knowledge. The one possessing knowledge is the one possessing knowledge. The one having knowledge is the one having knowledge. The one with knowledge is the one with knowledge. The one without knowledge is the one without knowledge. The one not knowing is the one not knowing. The one not having knowledge is the purifier. The one not possessing knowledge is the purifier.
3.5.5.9	Having made a fire-place in the south-east corner of the cremation ground, having spread Darbha grass around the fire, the dead body and the cremation ground, and having spread Darbha grasses in the south of the fire-place, he places the vessels one by one on them.
3.6.1.20	The inferior one (of the two) is excluded from the kingdom. Those who have gone away, the branches touched by the king desiring (to touch them), all those metals purified by the wind, may they unite us with offspring, wealth and lustre.
3.6.1.21	Where the waters go, they go without looking back.
3.6.1.22	The women, with their clothes on, facing the south, and with mud on their bodies, float in the water, saying, "May Dhātā purify, may Savitā purify."
3.6.1.23	Having sprinkled water three times with the name at the head, having crossed over and sipped water, he stands facing the sun, reciting, "We rise from darkness."
3.6.1.24	Then they return to their homes.
3.6.1.25	They do whatever the women say here.
3.5.6.2	When she is about to lie down, she presses her knees against the man's knees. We have removed the dirt of the man and woman. May no one else come before us in old age."
3.5.6.3	Here they kill her with a weapon.
3.5.6.4	Then he recites the following verse to the vital airs of the person which are being released: "I have released your vital air, O man, in the body. Come to the earth, come to the fathers. Bring us here with offspring."
3.6.2.1	At this time, the ministers of the king, with dishevelled hair, apply oil to their hair and beards, who are present in the vicinity.
3.6.2.2	There is an option in other cases.
3.6.2.3	They should either apply oil or stop.
3.6.2.4	But according to Bodhāyana's view, oil should be applied even in the absence of the king, if one has heard about it.
3.6.2.5	Some say that those who have not yet completed their studies should not apply oil except in a monastery.
3.5.6.5	Having risen, they remove the dust. "May I not be hurt! I am the beloved, the true goddess. When the two worlds are destroyed by the wind, may both worlds be covered with milk."
3.6.2.6	For the mother, father, and preceptor, one should abstain from eating salt and sour substances, sleep on the ground, and observe celibacy for three nights, six nights, twelve nights, a year, until the moon is visible, or half of twelve nights. For the supreme guru, it is done for three nights, and for others, it is done until death. For the widow of a deceased person, it is done throughout life.
3.5.6.6	Then he instructs him: "Having cut off the flesh from the limbs, except for the bones, and having not uttered any sound, and not thrown it away, and having cooked it in a single pot, he should place the known fat, the known heart, the known tongue, the known skin, with the head, beard, and feet, in the known stream of urine, and the known marrow."
3.5.6.7	Then he makes his wife lie down, saying, "This woman, seeking the world of her husband, lies down; may she, following thee, O mortal, the ancient, the universal, protect thee. May she here have offspring and wealth."
3.6.2.7	If a householder with a fire altar should die away from home, his body should be brought to the fire altars, which are burning and calling him, and should be consigned to the fire.
3.6.2.8	Having milked the cow for the deceased, one should pour the milk into the Garhapatya fire and then into the Ahavaniya fire.
3.5.6.8	Holding her by the left hand, he makes her rise, saying, "Rise up, O woman, and live; this is the last of your dead. Come, thou art taken by the hand of the one who desires thee. This is thy husband's duty, thou hast attained it."
3.5.6.9	Then he wipes his hands with gold, taking from the hands of the dead, for prosperity, for Brahman, for splendour, for strength. Herein thou art, here we are, well-favoured. May we conquer all our foes and overcome our enemies. Thus the Brahman takes the bow from the hands of a dead man, for prosperity, strength, for the Kshatriya, for strength. Thus the Rajanya takes the gem from the hands of one dead, for prosperity of the community, for nourishment, for strength.
3.6.2.9	The kindling-sticks are brought from below, because it is known that the gods take them from above.
3.6.2.10	Having brought it, he should go beyond the lightning and thunder, and offer it to the east. Having brought it, he goes beyond the lightning and the thunder, and offers it to the east.
3.5.6.10-14	And what the women say here, they do. Then he places him on the funeral pyre with the wooden stool. Pulling out the rope, they throw away the wooden stool. The dead man lies on the black antelope skin and the rope. On his vital airs he places pieces of gold.
3.6.2.11	If a householder with the sacred fires were to go elsewhere, he should draw three fire-rooms near the water's edge, enter them once, close his eyes, and gaze at the sun from the southeast.
3.6.2.12	And he should also perform the circumambulation.
3.6.2.13	If he is in a foreign land, he should do this three times.
3.5.6.15	He offers with two spoonfuls of the oblation-material taken in the ladle, with the two half-verses, "The variegated army of the gods has risen up." It is understood that he offers with the two half verses.
3.5.7.1	How should he join the vessels?
3.6.2.14	If he is burnt, then having brought the bones, having made a human figure on a black antelope skin within the altar, having placed the vessels over them, having covered them with fresh Kuśa grass, they should fast as prescribed.
3.6.2.15	If bones are not available, then one should make a human-shaped figure out of three hundred and sixty palm-sized pieces of wood, and place the vessels on it, covering it with fresh Kuśa grass. One should observe a fast as prescribed.
3.6.2.16	It is known that the fire-kindling fire is offered with the sacrificial vessels.
3.6.2.17	For the offering of a man is his most beloved. Thus they describe the well-known offering of Agni.
3.6.2.18	But they also say that the bodies of Agni are his heirs.
3.5.7.2	Having filled the mouth with a ladle of clarified butter mixed with curds, having placed the two ladles in the nostrils, having placed the pieces of gold in the eyes, or having placed the two spoons of clarified butter in the ears, having broken the Prastara and having placed one each in the cheeks, having placed the pestle and mortar on the head, having placed the skull on the forehead, having placed the Ekakapala on the head, and having placed the Praṇītā vessel, he places the vessel saying, "O Agni, do not burn this vessel. It is dear to the gods and also to the gentle ones. This is the vessel for drinking by the gods, in which the gods may be pleased with nectar."
3.6.2.19	That also is known as ten, a hundred, or a thousand years, when the gods have made our bodies old. Where sons become fathers, may they not harm us in the middle of our life.
3.6.3.1	Now, then, the accumulation.
3.6.3.2	When one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven, or twelve months have passed, they should complete and accumulate the offerings.
3.6.3.3	He prepares a hundred (measures) of milk, ghee, a pitcher of water, darbha grass for spreading, blue and red threads, a fruit of the bṛhatī plant, a stone, an apāmārga plant, a branch of the vaiḍūrya plant, sand, three kinds of leaves, and a branch.
3.6.3.4	Therefore, having made coals from burning (wood), he offers three Avassarjaniya oblations: "Let Agni again release, let him unite with the Fathers. Whatever black bird has pecked at you,"
3.5.7.3	In the right hand he places the Juhu, in the left the Upamant, on the chest the Dhruva, the Upavesha, the Aranis, on the right shoulder the Meshan, on the left the Pisht-udvani, on the back the Spha, on the belly the wooden vessel, on the belly two bowls, the covering of the Sannayy, the carrying of the Ced, on the flanks the Sannayy-pot, on the feet the Agnihotra-pot, on both thighs the Anv-aharya-pot, on his knees the mortar and pestle, on the testicles the stone for grinding, on the penis the Vrishavaran, the Shamia, on the sides the sieve, having cut it into pieces, he places the head of the sieve, the Kurch, which is to be placed near.
3.6.3.5	Having placed the milk and the pot of water in this (fire), and having sprinkled with the twigs of Vitex negundo, he prepares it, not proclaiming the bodies. With the six verses, "We have churned that Agni whom ye have churned."
3.6.3.6	They should recite the first and the last two times.
3.5.7.4-9	The wooden foot-rest is to be used for the feet. The remaining (articles) are to be placed between the knees. The wooden articles are to be used for water. It is understood that the wooden articles are to used for water. Here they are to be placed. They should give the articles made of iron and copper to the Brahmanas.
3.6.3.7	Then having sprinkled this fire with water-pots, having placed the stone of rest on the left hand of the chief woman of his wives, having wiped it once with the two kinds of urine, having looked at it, he takes the bones of the head or the skull. "He says, "Rise, gather your body. Carry away the body, not the flesh. Go where you wish to go. There may the god Savitr place you."
3.5.7.10	Those which are moist, he should fill with curds mixed with ghee.
3.5.7.11	He should touch the others.
3.5.7.12	It is known that they are not empty.
3.5.7.13	Here itself, they put the Upavajinam, the Kharī, and the Nalva.
3.5.7.14	Then, having taken out the Amikṣā, he should place it in his hands, saying, "For Mitra and Varuna you."
3.6.3.8	This is the second one.
3.6.3.9	This is the third one.
3.6.3.10	This one is the fourth one.
3.6.3.11	This fifth one.
3.6.3.12	This sixth one.
3.6.3.13	Then he makes a ball of the well-accumulated (earth) after accumulating it.
3.6.3.14	He does it in such a way that the pigeon does not sit in the shade.
3.6.3.15	Then he covers it with an unlimited number of small stones, but he does not cover it in such a manner that the pigeon sits in the shade.
3.5.7.18	Then he covers him with a skin, with hair upwards, with the head and feet, with the words, "O Agni, thou art covered with the cows, be covered with the fat and marrow. Thou, the drinker, the strong, the vigorous, the destroyer, the burning, art covered with the skin."
3.5.8.1	If they do not cover it with the covering-cloth, he should discard it.
3.6.3.16	Then having washed these bones with water, having placed them in a pot or in a vessel, he rises up, saying, "Rise up, go forward, make thy dwelling in the highest heaven. Thou art united with Yama and Yamī; may we ascend to the highest heaven."
3.6.3.17	Having placed the pot containing the bones, now follows the offering of the sacrificial oblation. If one desires, "May he be of endless world,"
3.5.8.2	Or he may give it to Brahmanas.
3.5.8.3	Having given it, one comes to know that they become prosperous here itself.
3.5.8.4	If he is going to release it, he should lead it around in a counter-clockwise direction with the verse, "We see the young woman moving around." He should lead it around three times with this verse three times. Then he should lead it towards the north and establish it there, reciting the verse, "Those who are living and those who are dead."
3.6.3.18	He places it on the ground, which is well-beaten, well-pounded, well-spread, saying, "For thee on the earth, for thee on the imperishable, for thee on water, for thee on plants, for thee on heaven, for thee on space, for thee on Brahman, for thee on prosperity, for thee on this world, for thee on that world."
3.6.3.19	It is known that he becomes one with an endless world.
3.6.3.20	They make three furrows with the pot at the rear.
3.5.8.5	Then, having plucked out the hairs of her ears, he should place them on her hands, saying, "With the dark and tawny ones."
3.5.8.6	The right one on the right, the left one on the left.
3.6.3.21-25	That has been explained before. Having killed the reeds with the leaves and branches with a weak iron-rod, they move away. That has been explained before.
3.5.8.7	Then she releases her, saying, "The daughter of the Rudras, the sister of the Vasus, the navel of the Adityas, I proclaim to you, O healer, for the people. Do not drink the water, do not eat the grass. O Aditi, do not drink the water. Drink the water. Eat the grass. O Agni, do not drink. Drink the water."
3.6.3.26	Having taken up water with the name-formula three times, having crossed (the river) and sipped water, he worships the sun with the formula, "We have risen above darkness."
3.6.3.27	Then they return to their homes.
3.6.3.28	They do whatever the women here say.
3.6.4.1	If they are going to cremate again, they should leave the ladle, the spoon, the black antelope skin, the stone, the wooden sword, and the fire-stirring stick in front.
3.5.8.8	Then he makes him fast, first with the Āhavanīya, then with the Anvāhāryapacana, then with the Garhapatya, then with both the Sabhya and Avaskhya fires.
3.5.8.9	Here also there is a conjecture.
3.5.8.10	If the Āhavanīyī fire were to blaze first, one should know that he has gone to the world of gods.
3.6.4.2	Now if they are taken away, having taken the kindling wood of any Ficus religiosa tree, having kindled the fire, having spread it on a black antelope skin, having placed the pestle and the grinding stone, having ground the bones, having mixed them with old ghee, he offers the exudation of the Soma plant with the ladle, saying, "Thou art born from this, may this be born from thee. To Agni Vaiśvānara, to the heavenly world, svāhā."
3.5.8.11	If the Anvāhāryapacana fire goes to the world of the Fathers,
3.5.8.12	if the Garhapatya fire goes to the heavenly world,
3.5.8.13	if the Sabhya and Avaskas fires go to the world of seven sages,
3.5.8.14	if all the fires together go up in flames, one should know that they have gone to the world of Brahma.
3.5.8.15	Whatever women say here, they do.
3.6.4.3	Here itself he strikes again: "The ladle, the spoon, the black antelope skin, the stone, the wooden ladle, the fire-stirring stick."
3.6.4.4	Here also there are metaphors.
3.6.1.1	Then he lights it.
3.6.1.2	While being lighted, he recites the formula, "O Agni, do not burn him. Do not grieve. Do not burn his skin. Do not burn the body. When you have cooked him, O Jātavedas, then send him to the Fathers."
3.6.4.5	If it blazes upwards, he should know that it has gone to the world of the gods. If it blazes for a moment and then goes out, he should know it has gone to space. If it blames downwards, he should know this is the case.
3.6.4.6	Whatever the women here say, they do.
3.6.1.3	When thou, O Jātavedas, dost make it boil, then thou givest it to the Fathers. When he goes beyond this ill-omened one, then he becomes obedient to the Gods.
3.6.4.7	And he should not be buried after this.
3.6.4.8	Or he should be cremated by those who are skilled in the rite, or he should be creamed by those who are not skilled.
3.6.4.9	The sun shines upon him, the wind blows upon him, and he is not harmed by the touch of the sun, the wind, or the water.
3.6.1.4	Here he explains the six Hotr-s. "Let your eye go to the sun, let your body go to the wind, go to heaven and earth with righteousness. Go to the waters, if that is good for you. Stand in the plants with your bodies."
3.6.4.10-11	Those who thus place it, and those who know it thus, the Ahinas and Hayanas placed it on the ashvattha tree. He did it thus. For him the Ahinas and the Hayanas became more and more prosperous. For him the offspring becomes more and more prosperous and more and more prosperous.
3.6.1.5	Here he binds him with a sharp arrow at the end of the altar, saying, "The goat is the share, do thou burn him with austerity. May thy lustre burn him, may thy flame burn him. Thy auspicious forms, O Jātavedas, by them may we go to the well-done worlds where are the worlds."
3.6.1.6	If he runs away, he does not turn him back.
3.6.1.7	Some indeed do it before fasting.
3.6.4.12	For him, the Kauṣītakins, the most excellent, the most excellent indeed, are the ones who are dying for him. The progeny of him for whom they are dying becomes more and more excellent. Those who know him thus, and those who know him thus,
3.6.1.8	With a pitcher of water, they go around three times in the opposite direction with the Varuni verses.
3.6.1.9	Then, covering it with a leaf-made ladle, he offers the oblation with the verse, "To those who are the protectors of this path, svāhā." He offers nine oblations with the ladle.
3.7.1.1	Then, when he is about to go home, he prepares the following things: a ladle, a spoon, the enclosing sticks, a grass-made sacrificial grass, a leaf-made sacrificial grass-wood, a red hide, a new calf, clarified butter, collyrium, a stone, a horse, a Samī wood twig, young Kuśa grass, a Darbha pillar, a goat, and barley.
3.6.1.10	Then he offers to another (fire). "This is thee; thou art above this. This is thy womb. This is thy son, the all-consuming fire, the creator of the world, the knower of beings. May he carry us to the good deeds, to the worlds where are the good deeds. Svāhā."
3.6.1.11	Here only he strikes with the ladle.
3.7.1.2	Then having placed the fire in between the village and the cremation ground, having spread a grass-made sacrificial grass, having placed the enclosing sticks of wood, having anointed the wood-made kindling wood, having kindled it with the utterance of "svāhā", then he spreads the red skin of a cow, with its tail towards the fire, with its neck towards the east, with the hair towards the north.
3.6.1.12	Here he offers the oblations on the Iḍa-wood, covering them with the Udumbara-wood. He offers with the formula, "To Agni, the bestower of wealth, svāhā."
3.6.1.13	Here only he strikes the ladle with the ladle, with the back towards the fire.
3.6.1.14	Then he worships him with the hymn of Yama, consisting of nine verses, with the verse, "Agni shines brightly, the herald, the great one."
3.6.1.15	Sitting down, he recites the verses in reverse order.
3.7.1.3	Those who are his relatives ascend (the chariot) as far as they can. Ascending, they sing his long life, striving in order. Stand here, O Tvashtra, the well-born, the giver of good gems, for long life, for life, for us.
3.7.1.4	Then they arrange them in order, as the days are in order, as they go by the seasons, as they are arranged. So that the later one does not leave the former behind. O Creator, arrange their lives.
3.6.1.16	The three Dakshina-courses are drawn with the fire-place at the rear.
3.6.1.17	Having sprinkled them with water, they cover them with sand and collect them, the younger ones collecting before the elder ones.
3.6.1.18	"O ye who have the stone, ye who have the Reva, collect yourselves; rise up, O friends, and cross over. Here we leave those who are not with us. May we go to the auspicious prizes."
3.7.1.5	Then, taking four spoonfuls with the elephant ladle into the elephant ladle, he offers. "For you, O Agni, the mortal has not done any cruel deed. The monkey shines forth again. The womb is your offspring, like a cow. May Agni purify our sin. May he purify our wealth. May he purify for us the sin that leads to death. Svāhā!"
3.7.1.6	Then he offers with the ladle of elephant-skin, with the formula, "May it cleanse us from sin." Twelve oblations are offered with the ladle.
3.7.1.7	Then, having risen, they undertake the Anudvāha rite, with the formula: "We undertake the Anudvahā rite for welfare. May he be like Indra to the gods, a carrier of fire."
3.6.1.19	Having bound the weak one with a stone, they creep away. The weak one is the one who is not able to move. The stone is the one who moves. The weak one moves away. The one who moves is the one who does not move. The one who does not know is the one who knows. The one who knows is the one who has knowledge. The one who has knowledge is the one who possesses knowledge. The one possessing knowledge is the one possessing knowledge. The one having knowledge is the one having knowledge. The one with knowledge is the one with knowledge. The one without knowledge is the one without knowledge. The one not knowing is the one not knowing. The one not having knowledge is the purifier. The one not possessing knowledge is the purifier.
3.7.1.8	These living beings go forward, turning back from death. May the auspicious one be turned towards us. Today, going forward, they go to the cow for falsehood and play. Extending their life span and giving it strength, they approach the abode of death. Extending their life span and providing strength, They grow with offspring and wealth, pure and cleansed, becoming fit for sacrifice.
3.6.1.20	The inferior one (of the two) is excluded from the kingdom. Those who have gone away, the branches touched by the king desiring (to touch them), all those metals purified by the wind, may they unite us with offspring, wealth and lustre.
3.6.1.21	Where the waters go, they go without looking back.
3.7.2.1	Then he places the stone between the fire and the village, with the formula, "I place this boundary for the living; may it not be followed by another. May they live a hundred years, looking towards the east. We place death behind the mountain."
3.7.2.2	Then the wives anoint themselves with fresh ghee, saying, "May these women, widows no more, be anointed with ghee."
3.7.2.3	He is anointed with fresh kuśa grass and trikakuda ointment, saying, "The ointment that is trikakuda, born from the Himalayas, with that root of nectar we destroy our enemies."
3.6.1.22	The women, with their clothes on, facing the south, and with mud on their bodies, float in the water, saying, "May Dhātā purify, may Savitā purify."
3.6.1.23	Having sprinkled water three times with the name at the head, having crossed over and sipped water, he stands facing the sun, reciting, "We rise from darkness."
3.6.1.24	Then they return to their homes.
3.6.1.25	They do whatever the women say here.
3.7.2.4	Then having collected these fresh Kuśa grass, he places them on a bunch of Darbha grass.
3.7.2.5	"Just as you, O herb, are growing up above the earth, in the same way may these (people) grow up with fame, glory and brilliance."
3.6.2.1	At this time, the ministers of the king, with dishevelled hair, apply oil to their hair and beards, who are present in the vicinity.
3.6.2.2	There is an option in other cases.
3.6.2.3	They should either apply oil or stop.
3.6.2.4	But according to Bodhāyana's view, oil should be applied even in the absence of the king, if one has heard about it.
3.6.2.5	Some say that those who have not yet completed their studies should not apply oil except in a monastery.
3.7.2.6	Having returned home, they ascend the couch, reciting, "The unerring, the faultless, the well-behaved ones ascend the womb, the first-born."
3.7.2.7	On this day they cook the goat.
3.7.2.8	And also barley-meal.
3.7.2.9	He eats the goat.
3.7.2.10	"The goat is mine, the goat is yours, from sin and hatred."
3.7.2.11	He eats the barley-meal.
3.6.2.6	For the mother, father, and preceptor, one should abstain from eating salt and sour substances, sleep on the ground, and observe celibacy for three nights, six nights, twelve nights, a year, until the moon is visible, or half of twelve nights. For the supreme guru, it is done for three nights, and for others, it is done until death. For the widow of a deceased person, it is done throughout life.
3.6.2.7	If a householder with a fire altar should die away from home, his body should be brought to the fire altars, which are burning and calling him, and should be consigned to the fire.
3.6.2.8	Having milked the cow for the deceased, one should pour the milk into the Garhapatya fire and then into the Ahavaniya fire.
3.7.2.12	You are the grain, may we be prosperous. From evil, from hatreds.
3.7.2.13	Then they perform the obsequies for him.
3.7.2.14	He should give on one day, or on three days, or on five days, or on seven days, or on nine days, or on eleven days, or on twelve days, or on fifteen days, or on thirty days, or on sixty days, or on ninety days, or on one hundred and twenty days, or on six months, or on one year, or on two years, or on three years, or on four years, or on five years, or on six years, or on seven years, or on eight years, or on nine years, or on ten years, or on eleven years, or on twelve years, or on thirteen years, or on fourteen years, or on fifteen years, or on sixteen years, or on seventeen years, or on eighteen years, or on nineteen years, or on twenty years, or on thirty years, or on forty years, or on fifty years, or on sixty years, or on seventy years, or on eighty years, or on ninety years, or on one-hundred years, or on two-hundred years,
3.7.2.15	or on three-hundred years, he may give for as long as he likes, for eleven months.
3.7.2.16	He should not go beyond twelve months.
3.7.2.17	One should give on this day every year.
3.7.2.18	This is the proper way to do it.
3.7.2.19	For a woman who has not yet kindled the sacred fire, the pot-shaped bricks and the hair-cutting should be done with masculine pronouns, either by her father, mother or teacher.
3.7.2.20	Or else, one should give a thousand as a fee.
3.6.2.11	If a householder with the sacred fires were to go elsewhere, he should draw three fire-rooms near the water's edge, enter them once, close his eyes, and gaze at the sun from the southeast.
3.6.2.12	And he should also perform the circumambulation.
3.6.2.13	If he is in a foreign land, he should do this three times.
3.7.2.21	The Pitr-medha comes to an end. The Pitr- medha comes to anend.
3.7.3.1	As it is said, "When a man who has not attended to the fire goes away, he should offer the Agnihotra in the morning after having restored it, and should offer the New-moon sacrifice after having restored it."
3.7.3.2	One should perform these two rites as if they were performed by a living person.
3.6.2.14	If he is burnt, then having brought the bones, having made a human figure on a black antelope skin within the altar, having placed the vessels over them, having covered them with fresh Kuśa grass, they should fast as prescribed.
3.7.3.3	If he dies before offering the morning Agnihotra, or before the new moon has set, then his Agnihotra should be offered silently, and the new moon sacrifice should be performed silently, as it is done and as it is done.
3.6.2.15	If bones are not available, then one should make a human-shaped figure out of three hundred and sixty palm-sized pieces of wood, and place the vessels on it, covering it with fresh Kuśa grass. One should observe a fast as prescribed.
3.6.2.16	It is known that the fire-kindling fire is offered with the sacrificial vessels.
3.7.3.4	If he is cured, then he should offer the Agnihotra again in the morning, without any fault.
3.7.3.5	He should offer the sacrifice again on the new moon day, without any fault."
3.7.3.6	This means that one should not mix milk for the purpose of making curds, but should keep the milk aside.
3.6.2.17	For the offering of a man is his most beloved. Thus they describe the well-known offering of Agni.
3.6.2.18	But they also say that the bodies of Agni are his heirs.
3.6.2.19	That also is known as ten, a hundred, or a thousand years, when the gods have made our bodies old. Where sons become fathers, may they not harm us in the middle of our life.
3.6.3.1	Now, then, the accumulation.
3.7.3.7	As this is said in the Asandya, it is said here.
3.7.3.8	As this is known in the Antavedi, having made the shape of a man on the black antelope skin of the bodies, having placed the vessels on them, and having covered them with fresh Kusha grass, they should fast as is well known.
3.7.3.9	From the selection of the vessels onwards, it is well established.
3.6.3.2	When one, three, five, seven, nine, eleven, or twelve months have passed, they should complete and accumulate the offerings.
3.6.3.3	He prepares a hundred (measures) of milk, ghee, a pitcher of water, darbha grass for spreading, blue and red threads, a fruit of the bṛhatī plant, a stone, an apāmārga plant, a branch of the vaiḍūrya plant, sand, three kinds of leaves, and a branch.
3.7.3.10	This much is enough. There is no need to mention the sprinkling of the cow at the time of spreading the grass. One should spread the grass with fresh grass, dry cow-dung and ghee, reciting the verse "May the cow protect you with its armor." This same verse is to be recited while spreading the leaves.
3.7.3.11	Or, according to one's own preference.
3.7.3.12	Or, everything can be done silently, except for the sprinkling of the grass.
3.6.3.4	Therefore, having made coals from burning (wood), he offers three Avassarjaniya oblations: "Let Agni again release, let him unite with the Fathers. Whatever black bird has pecked at you,"
3.7.3.13	Now indeed it is said:
3.7.3.14	Prajapati, having created the creatures, was exhausted and lay down.
3.7.3.15	The gods, having collected the essence of the Brahman, the radiance, and anointed him with it.
3.7.3.16	One should say thus: "The four Hotars."
3.6.3.5	Having placed the milk and the pot of water in this (fire), and having sprinkled with the twigs of Vitex negundo, he prepares it, not proclaiming the bodies. With the six verses, "We have churned that Agni whom ye have churned."
3.6.3.6	They should recite the first and the last two times.
3.6.3.7	Then having sprinkled this fire with water-pots, having placed the stone of rest on the left hand of the chief woman of his wives, having wiped it once with the two kinds of urine, having looked at it, he takes the bones of the head or the skull. "He says, "Rise, gather your body. Carry away the body, not the flesh. Go where you wish to go. There may the god Savitr place you."
3.7.3.17	His oblation with the planets and Hotṛs, his nourishment with the Sūkta of the Lord, his resting with his wives, his path with the acceptance of gifts, his heart with the pieces of gold, his collection of vessels with the offerings, his fasting with the Jyotiṣmatī, his attendance with the Brāhmaṇas, the one Hotṛ, and the offering of ghee with the words "May effort be successful! Svāhā!" The oblation of flesh with the words "The mind with the continuity," the commendation with the Mṛtyu Sūkta, the collection with the Sūryā Sūkta, and the immersion with the Sūrya Sūkta. The attendance on the Sun with the Sūrye Sūkta.
3.6.3.8	This is the second one.
3.6.3.9	This is the third one.
3.6.3.10	This one is the fourth one.
3.6.3.11	This fifth one.
3.6.3.12	This sixth one.
3.6.3.13	Then he makes a ball of the well-accumulated (earth) after accumulating it.
3.7.3.18	They are called the Supreme Brahman.
3.7.3.19	One should not use them in a common cremation ground, nor for a non-teacher, nor for one who is not learned, nor for one without a beard.
3.7.3.20	This oblation is for the path, the sacrificial offering, the covering, and the burning again. If one were to perform this on a particular day, one should do it on that very day.
3.7.3.21	Up to the pot, for one who has not established the fire, and for a woman.
3.6.3.14	He does it in such a way that the pigeon does not sit in the shade.
3.6.3.15	Then he covers it with an unlimited number of small stones, but he does not cover it in such a manner that the pigeon sits in the shade.
3.6.3.16	Then having washed these bones with water, having placed them in a pot or in a vessel, he rises up, saying, "Rise up, go forward, make thy dwelling in the highest heaven. Thou art united with Yama and Yamī; may we ascend to the highest heaven."
3.6.3.17	Having placed the pot containing the bones, now follows the offering of the sacrificial oblation. If one desires, "May he be of endless world,"
3.7.3.22	The rites of the Haviryajna end with the Nivapana; those of the Soma sacrifice end with the Punaredhana; those of the Agnihotra end with the Citti.
3.7.3.23	If the death is of another person, the impurity lasts for ten days. After that, there is peace.
3.7.3.24	If the Citti dies during the Citti rites, the impurity ends with the Citti rites.
3.7.3.25	Having performed the Citti rites before the Karshus, he resumes the rites on the next day with the Dhunvana.
3.6.3.18	He places it on the ground, which is well-beaten, well-pounded, well-spread, saying, "For thee on the earth, for thee on the imperishable, for thee on water, for thee on plants, for thee on heaven, for thee on space, for thee on Brahman, for thee on prosperity, for thee on this world, for thee on that world."
3.6.3.19	It is known that he becomes one with an endless world.
3.6.3.20	They make three furrows with the pot at the rear.
3.6.3.21-25	That has been explained before. Having killed the reeds with the leaves and branches with a weak iron-rod, they move away. That has been explained before.
3.7.3.26	The rest is well known.
3.7.4.1	Now, the kinsmen of those who have died by water, and the mother, and the seven generations of the father, and the preceptor, and the pupil, and the co-wife, and the son, and the kinsmen of the same caste, and the kinsman of the same Gotra, and the kinswomen, and the kinsfolk of the same caste and Gotra, and those who are related to them through marriage, and those who have the same funeral rites, and those who belong to the same family, and those who live in the same house, and those who eat together, and those who share the same bed, and those who wear the same clothes, and those who offer the same oblations, and those who perform the same rites, and those whose funeral rites are performed together, and those whose bodies are cremated together, and those of the same caste who are related to each other through marriage, and the kinspeople of the same caste as those who have died, and the kins-people of the same Gotras as those who have passed away, and the kinswomenthe kinsmen of the dead, and the kinsfolks of the same caste of the dead, all these should observe the ten-day rule.
3.7.4.2	Others should observe the three-day rule.
3.6.3.26	Having taken up water with the name-formula three times, having crossed (the river) and sipped water, he worships the sun with the formula, "We have risen above darkness."
3.6.3.27	Then they return to their homes.
3.6.3.28	They do whatever the women here say.
3.6.4.1	If they are going to cremate again, they should leave the ladle, the spoon, the black antelope skin, the stone, the wooden sword, and the fire-stirring stick in front.
3.7.4.3	Some say that there is immediate purification in the case of a child or one who is in a foreign country.
3.7.4.4	Thus, the remembrance of the constant water offering is for women, those who are initiated by a teacher, and those who are initiated.
3.7.4.5	There is no cremation before the head shaving for those who have died.
3.7.4.6	There is neither the sacrifice of animals nor the offering of milk to those who are about to die. There is no fire offering for those who are not cremated.
3.6.4.2	Now if they are taken away, having taken the kindling wood of any Ficus religiosa tree, having kindled the fire, having spread it on a black antelope skin, having placed the pestle and the grinding stone, having ground the bones, having mixed them with old ghee, he offers the exudation of the Soma plant with the ladle, saying, "Thou art born from this, may this be born from thee. To Agni Vaiśvānara, to the heavenly world, svāhā."
3.7.4.7	There is no shaving of women, no funeral pyre, no burning again.
3.7.4.8	Women's vessels are like wood.
3.7.4.9	In the Pitrimedha of the Bahvricas, one should recite these mantras for women.
3.6.4.3	Here itself he strikes again: "The ladle, the spoon, the black antelope skin, the stone, the wooden ladle, the fire-stirring stick."
3.6.4.4	Here also there are metaphors.
3.6.4.5	If it blazes upwards, he should know that it has gone to the world of the gods. If it blazes for a moment and then goes out, he should know it has gone to space. If it blames downwards, he should know this is the case.
3.6.4.6	Whatever the women here say, they do.
3.6.4.7	And he should not be buried after this.
3.6.4.8	Or he should be cremated by those who are skilled in the rite, or he should be creamed by those who are not skilled.
3.6.4.9	The sun shines upon him, the wind blows upon him, and he is not harmed by the touch of the sun, the wind, or the water.
3.7.4.10	This woman, O world of the husband, may she aspire to you. O woman, may she live in the world of the living. Taking gold from the hand of the dead, taking a bow from the hand of a dead man, taking a gem from the hand of one who is dead, do not burn him, O Agni, do not grieve for him who is dead, O Jātavedas. The goat is your share, may you torment him with austerity. This one is you, this one is above you. This one is yours, this one is the one above. This one is the one, the one above is the one. The two dogs that are yours, the black bird that is yours, the one who has been struck by lightning, rise up, go forth, run, make yourself a place. You are born from this one. Go away, go away, and move away from here. Shake off, O Earth, do not obstruct me.
3.6.4.10-11	Those who thus place it, and those who know it thus, the Ahinas and Hayanas placed it on the ashvattha tree. He did it thus. For him the Ahinas and the Hayanas became more and more prosperous. For him the offspring becomes more and more prosperous and more and more prosperous.
3.7.4.11	One whose wife has died, who is about to perform the sacrifices, should install the fires in the wife he has married.
3.7.4.12	It is known that one man can have two wives.
3.7.4.13	The Pitryajna is performed by one whose wife has died.
3.7.4.14	Because he does not have a wife, there is no need for him to install the fires again.
3.7.4.15	It is also known that one woman cannot have two husbands.
3.6.4.12	For him, the Kauṣītakins, the most excellent, the most excellent indeed, are the ones who are dying for him. The progeny of him for whom they are dying becomes more and more excellent. Those who know him thus, and those who know him thus,
3.7.4.16	The text says that the husband and wife who have kindled the sacred fires are to be cremated with the fires and sacrificial vessels. This is because there is no distinction between them.
3.7.4.17	If the husband dies first, his funeral rites are to be performed with the fires and the sacrificial vessels. If the wife dies first, her funeral rites are to performed with the Upavasana rite.
3.7.4.18	If both die together, then a single funeral rite is performed for both.
3.7.1.1	Then, when he is about to go home, he prepares the following things: a ladle, a spoon, the enclosing sticks, a grass-made sacrificial grass, a leaf-made sacrificial grass-wood, a red hide, a new calf, clarified butter, collyrium, a stone, a horse, a Samī wood twig, young Kuśa grass, a Darbha pillar, a goat, and barley.
3.7.4.19	And the Upavasana would be for the purpose of the Ulmukara.
3.7.4.20	By the Upavasanā, one who has not kindled the fire, and a woman, should be cremated by the Nirmanthya.
3.7.4.21	Some say that it should be done by the Uttāpanīya.
3.7.4.22	Some others say that a woman or a boy should be cremated with the Nirmanthīya.
3.7.4.23	When the wife is burnt by the fire of the dead husband, what is the procedure to be followed?
3.7.1.2	Then having placed the fire in between the village and the cremation ground, having spread a grass-made sacrificial grass, having placed the enclosing sticks of wood, having anointed the wood-made kindling wood, having kindled it with the utterance of "svāhā", then he spreads the red skin of a cow, with its tail towards the fire, with its neck towards the east, with the hair towards the north.
3.7.1.3	Those who are his relatives ascend (the chariot) as far as they can. Ascending, they sing his long life, striving in order. Stand here, O Tvashtra, the well-born, the giver of good gems, for long life, for life, for us.
3.7.4.24	If he is going to perform a sacrifice, he should perform the Brahmodanika.
3.7.4.25	If he is going to enter the forest, he should perform only the Upaasana.
3.7.4.26	If he renounces, he should not be respected.
3.7.4.27	One who is impure should not perform a voluntary penance, offer a sacrifice, or study the Vedas, except for the Agnihotra and the Darsha-Paurnamasa sacrifices.
3.7.1.4	Then they arrange them in order, as the days are in order, as they go by the seasons, as they are arranged. So that the later one does not leave the former behind. O Creator, arrange their lives.
3.7.4.28	One should give to the priests as one wishes.
3.7.4.29	This means that one who is about to return home should prepare for his duties as a householder.
3.7.4.30	How should the ancestral rites be performed for one who wears the sacred thread over the left shoulder and for one who wears it over the right shoulder?
3.7.4.31	One should say, "For one who wears the thread over the left."
3.7.4.32	The oblation to the Pitrs is the same as that to the gods.
3.7.4.33	The two, Nivītin and Hareyu, placed the oblation on the funeral pyre.
3.7.1.5	Then, taking four spoonfuls with the elephant ladle into the elephant ladle, he offers. "For you, O Agni, the mortal has not done any cruel deed. The monkey shines forth again. The womb is your offspring, like a cow. May Agni purify our sin. May he purify our wealth. May he purify for us the sin that leads to death. Svāhā!"
3.8.1.1	Those who are to be purified for one day, three days, five, seven, nine, eleven, half a month, a month, a season, or a year, should be purified.
3.7.1.6	Then he offers with the ladle of elephant-skin, with the formula, "May it cleanse us from sin." Twelve oblations are offered with the ladle.
3.7.1.7	Then, having risen, they undertake the Anudvāha rite, with the formula: "We undertake the Anudvahā rite for welfare. May he be like Indra to the gods, a carrier of fire."
3.7.1.8	These living beings go forward, turning back from death. May the auspicious one be turned towards us. Today, going forward, they go to the cow for falsehood and play. Extending their life span and giving it strength, they approach the abode of death. Extending their life span and providing strength, They grow with offspring and wealth, pure and cleansed, becoming fit for sacrifice.
3.7.2.1	Then he places the stone between the fire and the village, with the formula, "I place this boundary for the living; may it not be followed by another. May they live a hundred years, looking towards the east. We place death behind the mountain."
3.8.1.2	He procures curd mixed with horse-dung, a pot with a hundred holes, three Palasha-branches, a red hide of a black antelope for beating, a rope for binding, six hundred bricks made of clay, an unlimited number of Lokampra bricks, two kinds of Dhānas mixed with sesamum and Atitila, milk for Abhivanī, a half-pot with roots, a bundle of grass, a worn-out garment, a bundle of grasses for clearing the ground, four clods, five gruels, five cakes, one with ghee, one with milk, one with curd, one with honey, four Stambas - Arjuna Stamba, Durva Stamba, Kasa Stamba, Kusha Stamba, four Paridhīs made of different trees, made of leaves, Varana, Vetasa, and Sami, two Varana branches, a bundle of herbs for clearing the ground and a support, barley made of all herbs, gravel, and gold, three Palasha branches.
3.7.2.2	Then the wives anoint themselves with fresh ghee, saying, "May these women, widows no more, be anointed with ghee."
3.7.2.3	He is anointed with fresh kuśa grass and trikakuda ointment, saying, "The ointment that is trikakuda, born from the Himalayas, with that root of nectar we destroy our enemies."
3.8.1.3	Or if there is a village or a cemetery or a house in between, or if the house is measured or being measured.
3.7.2.4	Then having collected these fresh Kuśa grass, he places them on a bunch of Darbha grass.
3.7.2.5	"Just as you, O herb, are growing up above the earth, in the same way may these (people) grow up with fame, glory and brilliance."
3.8.1.4	Having placed the Agni of the Vṛddhi-rite, having killed three Palāśa-trees, having placed the bone-pot between them, having raised a hundred-fold cover above it, he fills it with curds mixed with honey, with the two verses, "This oblation I offer to Vaiśvānara, this hundred-streamed ocean, this mountain."
3.7.2.6	Having returned home, they ascend the couch, reciting, "The unerring, the faultless, the well-behaved ones ascend the womb, the first-born."
3.7.2.7	On this day they cook the goat.
3.7.2.8	And also barley-meal.
3.7.2.9	He eats the goat.
3.7.2.10	"The goat is mine, the goat is yours, from sin and hatred."
3.7.2.11	He eats the barley-meal.
3.8.1.5	He recites the verse, "Drapsa has fallen down."
3.8.1.6	Then they go around the place of striking three times to the left with a red hide and a bull.
3.8.1.7	"Ajinamā ajinamā."
3.8.1.8	They go around three times in the night and three times in the day.
3.8.1.9	In the same way, the advisers and women.
3.8.1.10	The dancers should dance in accordance with that.
3.8.1.11	Those who are killed in a ditch or a swamp, they are brought to rest.
3.8.1.12	Those who are brought to rest, they do not go as they were before, so that they would not see the moon either in front or behind.
3.8.1.13	They got up at dawn and went, knowing that it was the place of cremation.
3.8.1.14	Then those four Brahmanas, taking the ladle, go to the north and collect the bricks or clods.
3.8.1.15	Then he sprinkles the burning place with water-pots, saying, "Go away, be gone, move away from here."
3.8.1.16	One should approach as long as one is alive. One should not strike a living person, for one would strike the vital breaths of a living person.
3.7.2.12	You are the grain, may we be prosperous. From evil, from hatreds.
3.7.2.13	Then they perform the obsequies for him.
3.7.2.14	He should give on one day, or on three days, or on five days, or on seven days, or on nine days, or on eleven days, or on twelve days, or on fifteen days, or on thirty days, or on sixty days, or on ninety days, or on one hundred and twenty days, or on six months, or on one year, or on two years, or on three years, or on four years, or on five years, or on six years, or on seven years, or on eight years, or on nine years, or on ten years, or on eleven years, or on twelve years, or on thirteen years, or on fourteen years, or on fifteen years, or on sixteen years, or on seventeen years, or on eighteen years, or on nineteen years, or on twenty years, or on thirty years, or on forty years, or on fifty years, or on sixty years, or on seventy years, or on eighty years, or on ninety years, or on one-hundred years, or on two-hundred years,
3.7.2.15	or on three-hundred years, he may give for as long as he likes, for eleven months.
3.8.1.17	Having bound the rope with the branches of a tree, he should sleep in the prescribed measure.
3.8.1.18	If it is neck-high in front and navel-high in the back, if it is knee-high in front, ankle-high in the rear, if it is ankle-high in front or equal to the ground in the rear, it is known to be human-sized.
3.8.1.19	He writes the line with the two lines as described.
3.8.1.20	Having removed the line, they dig the furrow.
3.8.1.21	They raise it on its right side and make it higher at the back.
3.8.2.1	Then he takes Agni in himself with the two formulas, "I take Agni in myself first, Agni who is ours."
3.7.2.16	He should not go beyond twelve months.
3.7.2.17	One should give on this day every year.
3.7.2.18	This is the proper way to do it.
3.7.2.19	For a woman who has not yet kindled the sacred fire, the pot-shaped bricks and the hair-cutting should be done with masculine pronouns, either by her father, mother or teacher.
3.7.2.20	Or else, one should give a thousand as a fee.
3.8.2.2	He himself recites the verse, "Those are thy kindling woods, O Agni, those are thy abodes."
3.8.2.3	Touching the white horse, he places this sand within (the altar) with the verse, "May Prajapati place thee; may it be firm like Angiras with that deity."
3.7.2.21	The Pitr-medha comes to an end. The Pitr- medha comes to anend.
3.7.3.1	As it is said, "When a man who has not attended to the fire goes away, he should offer the Agnihotra in the morning after having restored it, and should offer the New-moon sacrifice after having restored it."
3.7.3.2	One should perform these two rites as if they were performed by a living person.
3.8.2.4	Then, in front of it, a yoke of ploughs is made of Udumbara wood, with seven or twelve oxen, or with horses. The oxen are good, the men are good, the plough is good, the ploughshares are good, the yokes are good, the goads are good, the oxen are good, and the ploughs are good. The ploughs are good, the ploughing is good, the oxen and the ploughs give us good ploughing. With these two verses.
3.7.3.3	If he dies before offering the morning Agnihotra, or before the new moon has set, then his Agnihotra should be offered silently, and the new moon sacrifice should be performed silently, as it is done and as it is done.
3.7.3.4	If he is cured, then he should offer the Agnihotra again in the morning, without any fault.
3.7.3.5	He should offer the sacrifice again on the new moon day, without any fault."
3.7.3.6	This means that one should not mix milk for the purpose of making curds, but should keep the milk aside.
3.8.2.5	He looks at Sita (the sacrificial post) and says, "We salute thee, O Sita, the auspicious one. Be auspicious to us. Be thou as auspicious to us as thou art to the auspicious ones. Be thou as fruitful to us as thou are to the fruitful ones."
3.8.2.6	Then he places the skull of the bones in Sita (the sacrificial pit) with the verse, "These bodies of mine have been placed by Savitar on the lap of the mother earth. May they be auspicious to Aditi."
3.7.3.7	As this is said in the Asandya, it is said here.
3.7.3.8	As this is known in the Antavedi, having made the shape of a man on the black antelope skin of the bodies, having placed the vessels on them, and having covered them with fresh Kusha grass, they should fast as is well known.
3.7.3.9	From the selection of the vessels onwards, it is well established.
3.8.2.7	Then he releases the animals, saying, "Be released, ye harmless ones, going to the gods. We have crossed over the darkness, we have attained the light, the water, and the heaven."
3.8.2.8	These are the Adhvaryus if the sacrifice is with Dakshina.
3.8.2.9	If the sacrifice is a Sattra, the Agni is released like a cow.
3.8.2.10	Where the oxen are, that is the yoke and plough.
3.8.2.11	Then he fans him with the wind, saying, 'The winds blow, the lightning flashes, the plants grow, the waters swell, the heaven rains, the rain nourishes the earth with its seed.'
3.7.3.10	This much is enough. There is no need to mention the sprinkling of the cow at the time of spreading the grass. One should spread the grass with fresh grass, dry cow-dung and ghee, reciting the verse "May the cow protect you with its armor." This same verse is to be recited while spreading the leaves.
3.7.3.11	Or, according to one's own preference.
3.7.3.12	Or, everything can be done silently, except for the sprinkling of the grass.
3.8.2.12	He scatters the seeds of all herbs like fire, as the five men scattered the seeds for Yama, so I scatter the seeds for harmony, as there are many in the world of the living.
3.8.2.13	Here he scatters sand with six verses in anuṣṭubh metre, "O Agni, may your fame be ours."
3.7.3.13	Now indeed it is said:
3.7.3.14	Prajapati, having created the creatures, was exhausted and lay down.
3.7.3.15	The gods, having collected the essence of the Brahman, the radiance, and anointed him with it.
3.7.3.16	One should say thus: "The four Hotars."
3.8.2.14	Then he lays down the Upadha bricks with the verse, "May the Cit and Paricit, the Upadha, be firm. May the Fathers, the deities, be firm. Prajapati may settle you. May you be firm with that deity, like Angiras."
3.8.2.15	Then he arranges them with the verse, “May you be nourished.” With the Gayatri verse for the Brahman.
3.8.2.16	With the verse, “Your milk may be united,” with the Tristubh verse for the Rajanya. He arranges them as well as he can, as much as he can.
3.7.3.17	His oblation with the planets and Hotṛs, his nourishment with the Sūkta of the Lord, his resting with his wives, his path with the acceptance of gifts, his heart with the pieces of gold, his collection of vessels with the offerings, his fasting with the Jyotiṣmatī, his attendance with the Brāhmaṇas, the one Hotṛ, and the offering of ghee with the words "May effort be successful! Svāhā!" The oblation of flesh with the words "The mind with the continuity," the commendation with the Mṛtyu Sūkta, the collection with the Sūryā Sūkta, and the immersion with the Sūrya Sūkta. The attendance on the Sun with the Sūrye Sūkta.
3.8.2.17	Then with two (verses) he takes Agni in himself, with the words, "I take Agni first in myself; Agni who is ours."
3.8.2.18	He mutters the Svayamciti verse, "Those thy kindling woods, O Agni, those thy abodes."
3.8.2.19	Touching a white horse, he mutters the Abhi-dravana verse, "This is the going down of the waters; salutations to them." Two verses.
3.8.2.20	Then he lays down four clods of earth in the field, with the formulas, "I cut thee from the earth, I place thee in thy place. May I not be an enemy to thee. May the Fathers hold this post. May Yama release thee from that place." He lays them down in front.
3.7.3.18	They are called the Supreme Brahman.
3.7.3.19	One should not use them in a common cremation ground, nor for a non-teacher, nor for one who is not learned, nor for one without a beard.
3.7.3.20	This oblation is for the path, the sacrificial offering, the covering, and the burning again. If one were to perform this on a particular day, one should do it on that very day.
3.7.3.21	Up to the pot, for one who has not established the fire, and for a woman.
3.8.2.21	"Come near, O Mother Earth, the extensive, the beautiful, the golden, the youthful, the bountiful, the one who is on your right side. May she protect you from the evil influence of Nirriti." Thus (he recites) towards the north.
3.8.2.22	"Be kind to him, O Earth, do not injure him. Be easy to approach and easy to be with, like a mother to her son. Be kind to him, like the Earth." Thus (he says) towards the west.
3.7.3.22	The rites of the Haviryajna end with the Nivapana; those of the Soma sacrifice end with the Punaredhana; those of the Agnihotra end with the Citti.
3.7.3.23	If the death is of another person, the impurity lasts for ten days. After that, there is peace.
3.7.3.24	If the Citti dies during the Citti rites, the impurity ends with the Citti rites.
3.7.3.25	Having performed the Citti rites before the Karshus, he resumes the rites on the next day with the Dhunvana.
3.8.2.23	Standing on the earth, which is shaking, you are the one who is to be worshipped. May a thousand of them be yours. May these houses, flowing with honey, be for him, may they be his refuge here. Thus on the right side.
3.8.2.24	Having made that the deity, he performs the Sudadoha rite.
3.8.2.25	Then he covers him with cooked grains mixed with sesamum, with the verse, "May the cows be gentle, tawny, and dark-coloured, giving milk like sesamum, giving strength to him, may they be of all kinds, not giving any trouble."
3.8.2.26	Then he places the milk in a half-vessel towards the south, saying, "This is your share of food deposited in Yama's abode, your house. Your name is Akshiti." He takes the name of the sacrificer.
3.8.2.27	Having made it the deity, he performs the Sūdadohasa.
3.8.2.28	He places the sacrificial grass with its roots towards the south, reciting, "We offer this sacrificial grass to the Fathers, to the Gods. We shall offer the living grass to the Fathers. You go up to that. Be fit for sacrifice. You are united with Yama and Yamī."
3.8.2.29	Having made it the deity, he performs the Sūdadohasa rite.
3.7.3.26	The rest is well known.
3.7.4.1	Now, the kinsmen of those who have died by water, and the mother, and the seven generations of the father, and the preceptor, and the pupil, and the co-wife, and the son, and the kinsmen of the same caste, and the kinsman of the same Gotra, and the kinswomen, and the kinsfolk of the same caste and Gotra, and those who are related to them through marriage, and those who have the same funeral rites, and those who belong to the same family, and those who live in the same house, and those who eat together, and those who share the same bed, and those who wear the same clothes, and those who offer the same oblations, and those who perform the same rites, and those whose funeral rites are performed together, and those whose bodies are cremated together, and those of the same caste who are related to each other through marriage, and the kinspeople of the same caste as those who have died, and the kins-people of the same Gotras as those who have passed away, and the kinswomenthe kinsmen of the dead, and the kinsfolks of the same caste of the dead, all these should observe the ten-day rule.
3.7.4.2	Others should observe the three-day rule.
3.8.2.30	Then he lays down the Naleṣikā (twig) with the verse, "One should mount the raft of reeds, follow the path by means of this reed. You become the raft of reeds and cross the stream."
3.8.2.31	Having made it the deity, he performs the Sūdadohasam.
3.7.4.3	Some say that there is immediate purification in the case of a child or one who is in a foreign country.
3.7.4.4	Thus, the remembrance of the constant water offering is for women, those who are initiated by a teacher, and those who are initiated.
3.7.4.5	There is no cremation before the head shaving for those who have died.
3.7.4.6	There is neither the sacrifice of animals nor the offering of milk to those who are about to die. There is no fire offering for those who are not cremated.
3.8.2.32	Then, having cleansed the skull with a cloth that has been used for eating and drinking, he arranges it according to the limbs, saying, "O Earth, you have placed these bodies of ours on the lap of your mother. May they be well for you, O Earth."
3.7.4.7	There is no shaving of women, no funeral pyre, no burning again.
3.7.4.8	Women's vessels are like wood.
3.7.4.9	In the Pitrimedha of the Bahvricas, one should recite these mantras for women.
3.8.2.33	Here he explains the six Hotr-priests. The six Hotr-priest-s are the sun, your eye may go to the wind, your body may go to the sky and earth by the law. Go to the waters, if that is good for you. Stand in the plants with your bodies. Go beyond death, the supreme path.
3.8.2.34	Then he fans him with the wind, saying, "May the wind be auspicious, may the sun be auspicious, may all the plants be auspicious for thee. May the directions be auspicious for me.
3.7.4.10	This woman, O world of the husband, may she aspire to you. O woman, may she live in the world of the living. Taking gold from the hand of the dead, taking a bow from the hand of a dead man, taking a gem from the hand of one who is dead, do not burn him, O Agni, do not grieve for him who is dead, O Jātavedas. The goat is your share, may you torment him with austerity. This one is you, this one is above you. This one is yours, this one is the one above. This one is the one, the one above is the one. The two dogs that are yours, the black bird that is yours, the one who has been struck by lightning, rise up, go forth, run, make yourself a place. You are born from this one. Go away, go away, and move away from here. Shake off, O Earth, do not obstruct me.
3.7.4.11	One whose wife has died, who is about to perform the sacrifices, should install the fires in the wife he has married.
3.7.4.12	It is known that one man can have two wives.
3.7.4.13	The Pitryajna is performed by one whose wife has died.
3.7.4.14	Because he does not have a wife, there is no need for him to install the fires again.
3.7.4.15	It is also known that one woman cannot have two husbands.
3.7.4.16	The text says that the husband and wife who have kindled the sacred fires are to be cremated with the fires and sacrificial vessels. This is because there is no distinction between them.
3.7.4.17	If the husband dies first, his funeral rites are to be performed with the fires and the sacrificial vessels. If the wife dies first, her funeral rites are to performed with the Upavasana rite.
3.7.4.18	If both die together, then a single funeral rite is performed for both.
3.8.2.35	Then he lays down five oblations with cakes, with butter, with rice-gruel, saying, "May the oblation with cake, with butter, and with rice-grucl come here. The creator of the heaven and earth, the creator of the path, the creator of offspring, the creator of all, the creator of heaven, the creator of earth, the creator who has created all, the creator who is the creator of all. The creator who has created the heaven and earth. The creator who is the maker of the path. The creator who created the offspring. The creator who made all. The creator of heaven. The creator of earth. The creator of all. He takes the name of the sacrificer, saying, "This is your share of butter, this is your share of rice-gruel. This is your share of cake. This is your portion of butter. This is your oblation of rice-grucl. This is your cake. This is the oblation of ricegruel. This oblation of cake. This oblation with butter. This is the portion of butter. Here is your oblation with rice-gruc1. This is your rice-gruel."
3.8.2.36	"Protect it, guard it, I give it to thee. Thy fathers have placed thee in it. May Prajapati place thee in it. Let it be firm like Angiras, with that deity." He places it in front.
3.7.4.19	And the Upavasana would be for the purpose of the Ulmukara.
3.7.4.20	By the Upavasanā, one who has not kindled the fire, and a woman, should be cremated by the Nirmanthya.
3.7.4.21	Some say that it should be done by the Uttāpanīya.
3.7.4.22	Some others say that a woman or a boy should be cremated with the Nirmanthīya.
3.7.4.23	When the wife is burnt by the fire of the dead husband, what is the procedure to be followed?
3.8.2.37	He recites the verse, "He who desires Apūpa (cakes)..." towards the south. "He who desires milk..." towards the west. "He who possesses Apūpa and curd..." towards the north. "He who is endowed with Apūpa and honey..." towards the centre. "The one with a hundred syllables..." towards each direction. He recites the verses.
3.8.2.38	Having made the deity, he performs the Sūda dohsa.
3.7.4.24	If he is going to perform a sacrifice, he should perform the Brahmodanika.
3.7.4.25	If he is going to enter the forest, he should perform only the Upaasana.
3.7.4.26	If he renounces, he should not be respected.
3.7.4.27	One who is impure should not perform a voluntary penance, offer a sacrifice, or study the Vedas, except for the Agnihotra and the Darsha-Paurnamasa sacrifices.
3.8.2.39	Then he covers him with cooked grains mixed with sesamum, saying, "These are thy sweet offerings, thy ambrosial ones."
3.8.2.40	Having made him a deity, he performs the Sūdadohasa rite.
3.8.2.41	Then he places four posts.
3.7.4.28	One should give to the priests as one wishes.
3.7.4.29	This means that one who is about to return home should prepare for his duties as a householder.
3.7.4.30	How should the ancestral rites be performed for one who wears the sacred thread over the left shoulder and for one who wears it over the right shoulder?
3.7.4.31	One should say, "For one who wears the thread over the left."
3.7.4.32	The oblation to the Pitrs is the same as that to the gods.
3.7.4.33	The two, Nivītin and Hareyu, placed the oblation on the funeral pyre.
3.8.1.1	Those who are to be purified for one day, three days, five, seven, nine, eleven, half a month, a month, a season, or a year, should be purified.
3.8.1.2	He procures curd mixed with horse-dung, a pot with a hundred holes, three Palasha-branches, a red hide of a black antelope for beating, a rope for binding, six hundred bricks made of clay, an unlimited number of Lokampra bricks, two kinds of Dhānas mixed with sesamum and Atitila, milk for Abhivanī, a half-pot with roots, a bundle of grass, a worn-out garment, a bundle of grasses for clearing the ground, four clods, five gruels, five cakes, one with ghee, one with milk, one with curd, one with honey, four Stambas - Arjuna Stamba, Durva Stamba, Kasa Stamba, Kusha Stamba, four Paridhīs made of different trees, made of leaves, Varana, Vetasa, and Sami, two Varana branches, a bundle of herbs for clearing the ground and a support, barley made of all herbs, gravel, and gold, three Palasha branches.
3.8.3.1	The Brahmins know the milk of the herbs above the rice-balls. I have taken thee from among them for the rice-balls to be placed.

3.8.1.3	Or if there is a village or a cemetery or a house in between, or if the house is measured or being measured.
3.8.1.4	Having placed the Agni of the Vṛddhi-rite, having killed three Palāśa-trees, having placed the bone-pot between them, having raised a hundred-fold cover above it, he fills it with curds mixed with honey, with the two verses, "This oblation I offer to Vaiśvānara, this hundred-streamed ocean, this mountain."
3.8.3.4	Then he places four enclosing sticks of different trees, with the formulas, "May the trees not injure thee; may not thy mother injure thee. Thou art going to the world of Yama, where thou shalt shine." The two enclosing sticks of Vitex and of Smilax are in front and north.
3.8.3.5	Having made it a deity, he performs the Sūdadohasa rite.
3.8.3.6	Some do it with the formulas, Naleśīka.
3.8.3.7	Then he places the clods.
3.8.1.5	He recites the verse, "Drapsa has fallen down."
3.8.1.6	Then they go around the place of striking three times to the left with a red hide and a bull.
3.8.1.7	"Ajinamā ajinamā."
3.8.1.8	They go around three times in the night and three times in the day.
3.8.1.9	In the same way, the advisers and women.
3.8.1.10	The dancers should dance in accordance with that.
3.8.3.8	I place thee in the world of earth. May Prajapati place thee. Be thou firm according to that deity, like Angiras. He places a hundred in front, saying, "I place thee in the sky world." A hundred in the north, saying, "In the world of heaven." A hundred in back, saying, "Thee in the world of the quarters." A hundred in south, saying, " Thee in the world of quarters." "I place thee on the back of the sky, on the spreading of the Brahman." Two hundred in the middle.
3.8.1.11	Those who are killed in a ditch or a swamp, they are brought to rest.
3.8.1.12	Those who are brought to rest, they do not go as they were before, so that they would not see the moon either in front or behind.
3.8.1.13	They got up at dawn and went, knowing that it was the place of cremation.
3.8.3.9	Having made that the deity, he performs the Sūda-dohās.
3.8.3.10	Then he lays down the Lokampṛṇā bricks with the formula, "Thou fillest the world, thou fillest the void, thou fillest." With the Lokampṛnās, the number becomes a thousand.
3.8.3.11	In the case of the two thousand and four thousand bricks, one should lay down the same number again and again.
3.8.3.12	In the Kâthaka and Agnicita fires, one should lay the bricks eighty-five times.
3.8.1.14	Then those four Brahmanas, taking the ladle, go to the north and collect the bricks or clods.
3.8.1.15	Then he sprinkles the burning place with water-pots, saying, "Go away, be gone, move away from here."
3.8.1.16	One should approach as long as one is alive. One should not strike a living person, for one would strike the vital breaths of a living person.
3.8.1.17	Having bound the rope with the branches of a tree, he should sleep in the prescribed measure.
3.8.1.18	If it is neck-high in front and navel-high in the back, if it is knee-high in front, ankle-high in the rear, if it is ankle-high in front or equal to the ground in the rear, it is known to be human-sized.
3.8.3.13	Having known that one should offer the Sūtrāmaṇī sacrifice to Agni, or the Maitrāvaruṇa sacrifice with milk, this is the Brāhmaṇa of the Kāṭhaka Agni.
3.8.3.14	Having made it the deity, one performs the Sūda-dohās.
3.8.3.15	Then he fans it, saying, "May the wind be auspicious, may the sun be auspicious, may all the plants be auspicious for you, may all the directions be auspicious for you."
3.8.1.19	He writes the line with the two lines as described.
3.8.1.20	Having removed the line, they dig the furrow.
3.8.1.21	They raise it on its right side and make it higher at the back.
3.8.2.1	Then he takes Agni in himself with the two formulas, "I take Agni in myself first, Agni who is ours."
3.8.3.16	Then he touches him with the formula, "This is my protection from further distress and from the enemies. So has it been done by the Asvins, Mitra and Varuna."
3.8.3.17	He places the branch of the Vrana tree in front with the formula, "The god Vana-s-pati has protected this from distress, from ill-will and from hatred."
3.8.2.2	He himself recites the verse, "Those are thy kindling woods, O Agni, those are thy abodes."
3.8.2.3	Touching the white horse, he places this sand within (the altar) with the verse, "May Prajapati place thee; may it be firm like Angiras with that deity."
3.8.3.18	He places the grass-blades towards the north with the formula, "Thou art the support; do thou support us from sin and hatred."
3.8.3.19	He places the twig of the Sami tree towards the west with the formula, “Thou art the Sami; do thou pacify us from sin and enmity."
3.8.3.20	He places barley towards the south with the formula, "Thou art the barley; do thou barley us from sin and hostility."
3.8.2.4	Then, in front of it, a yoke of ploughs is made of Udumbara wood, with seven or twelve oxen, or with horses. The oxen are good, the men are good, the plough is good, the ploughshares are good, the yokes are good, the goads are good, the oxen are good, and the ploughs are good. The ploughs are good, the ploughing is good, the oxen and the ploughs give us good ploughing. With these two verses.
3.8.3.21	Then he addresses him: "Go to the earth, go to the sky, go to heaven, go to the directions, go to heaven (again), go to the directions (again), go again to heaven, go again to the sky, and go again to the earth. Go to the waters, if that is beneficial to you. Stand in the plants with your bodies."
3.8.3.22	They make three furrows behind the pyre, facing south and east.
3.8.2.5	He looks at Sita (the sacrificial post) and says, "We salute thee, O Sita, the auspicious one. Be auspicious to us. Be thou as auspicious to us as thou art to the auspicious ones. Be thou as fruitful to us as thou are to the fruitful ones."
3.8.2.6	Then he places the skull of the bones in Sita (the sacrificial pit) with the verse, "These bodies of mine have been placed by Savitar on the lap of the mother earth. May they be auspicious to Aditi."
3.8.3.23-27	That has been explained before. Having cut down the reeds with the leaves and branches, and having bound them with a weak iron rod, they move away. That has been explained before.
3.8.2.7	Then he releases the animals, saying, "Be released, ye harmless ones, going to the gods. We have crossed over the darkness, we have attained the light, the water, and the heaven."
3.8.2.8	These are the Adhvaryus if the sacrifice is with Dakshina.
3.8.2.9	If the sacrifice is a Sattra, the Agni is released like a cow.
3.8.3.28	Having thrice sprinkled water with the name, having crossed and sipped, he stands facing the sun, reciting, "We have risen from darkness."
3.8.3.29	Then they return home.
3.8.3.30	They do whatever the women here say.
3.8.3.31	Here they perform the Śānī rite. It is said that there is a reference to the Sautrāmaṇī.
3.8.3.32	Here one should perform with cooked barley.
3.8.2.10	Where the oxen are, that is the yoke and plough.
3.8.2.11	Then he fans him with the wind, saying, 'The winds blow, the lightning flashes, the plants grow, the waters swell, the heaven rains, the rain nourishes the earth with its seed.'
3.8.3.33	The Loṣṭa-oblation is concluded. The Loṣṭo-oblation is conluded.
3.9.1.1	Now if the sacrificer whose fire has been lost or carried away dies, if he has a son or a pupil who is fit for the rites,
3.8.2.12	He scatters the seeds of all herbs like fire, as the five men scattered the seeds for Yama, so I scatter the seeds for harmony, as there are many in the world of the living.
3.8.2.13	Here he scatters sand with six verses in anuṣṭubh metre, "O Agni, may your fame be ours."
3.9.1.2	Having put on the sacred thread, having sprinkled water, having placed the dead body in the place of the sacrificer, having placed the kindling wood in the place of Garhapatya, having taken hold of the right arm of the dead body, he churns, saying, "Those who are the fires of him who offers oblations, desiring meat, may they be born as the sacrificer, may they lead this dead body to heaven for the enjoyment of the oblation."
3.9.1.3	Having remained silent, having filled the ladle with twelve spoonfuls, and having followed mentally with the Puruṣa Sūkta, he offers in the Āhavanīya.
3.9.1.4	He offers in the Gārhapatya with the same.
3.9.1.5	Having offered silently in the Anvāhāryapacaniya, he should proceed with the rites pertaining to the ancestors.
3.8.2.14	Then he lays down the Upadha bricks with the verse, "May the Cit and Paricit, the Upadha, be firm. May the Fathers, the deities, be firm. Prajapati may settle you. May you be firm with that deity, like Angiras."
3.8.2.15	Then he arranges them with the verse, “May you be nourished.” With the Gayatri verse for the Brahman.
3.8.2.16	With the verse, “Your milk may be united,” with the Tristubh verse for the Rajanya. He arranges them as well as he can, as much as he can.
3.9.1.6	As it is said here, the bones of the deceased sacrificer are brought and purified.
3.9.1.7	How is the bringing here known?
3.9.1.8	It is known that one takes the bones in the order of head first, then chest, then belly, then thighs and arms, then the limbs, taking thirty-three bones. The Purusha is thirty-three.
3.8.2.17	Then with two (verses) he takes Agni in himself, with the words, "I take Agni first in myself; Agni who is ours."
3.8.2.18	He mutters the Svayamciti verse, "Those thy kindling woods, O Agni, those thy abodes."
3.8.2.19	Touching a white horse, he mutters the Abhi-dravana verse, "This is the going down of the waters; salutations to them." Two verses.
3.9.1.9	Then having washed the bones with water, he spreads out the black antelope skin with its neck towards the south and with its hairy side upwards, and puts the bones on it with the verse, "Indra with the bones of Dadhici."
3.9.1.10	He makes it a deity with the verse, “May it be firm like Angiras with that deity.”
3.8.2.20	Then he lays down four clods of earth in the field, with the formulas, "I cut thee from the earth, I place thee in thy place. May I not be an enemy to thee. May the Fathers hold this post. May Yama release thee from that place." He lays them down in front.
3.9.1.11	Then he performs the Sūdadohas (rites). The Pṛṣṇis, the Sūdadohasa rites, press Soma for him. The classes of gods are born in the three ascending regions of heaven.
3.9.1.12	They eat food from long-stemmed vessels, with salt and without salt, from earthen vessels.
3.9.1.13	Having deposited them on the boundary of the village, they should bring the fires.
3.8.2.21	"Come near, O Mother Earth, the extensive, the beautiful, the golden, the youthful, the bountiful, the one who is on your right side. May she protect you from the evil influence of Nirriti." Thus (he recites) towards the north.
3.8.2.22	"Be kind to him, O Earth, do not injure him. Be easy to approach and easy to be with, like a mother to her son. Be kind to him, like the Earth." Thus (he says) towards the west.
3.9.1.14	If the worldly fires were to be carried away, they would be lost.
3.9.1.15	But it is known that the sacrificer, before going away, gives his fires to someone else and then goes home.
3.9.1.16	They do not cross the boundary of the village.
3.9.1.17	Therefore, one should not carry the fires beyond the boundary of the house.
3.9.2.1	Now if the sacrificer should die while the fires are set up in him or on the kindling woods, or if his son or pupil is capable of performing the rites,
3.8.2.23	Standing on the earth, which is shaking, you are the one who is to be worshipped. May a thousand of them be yours. May these houses, flowing with honey, be for him, may they be his refuge here. Thus on the right side.
3.8.2.24	Having made that the deity, he performs the Sudadoha rite.
3.8.2.25	Then he covers him with cooked grains mixed with sesamum, with the verse, "May the cows be gentle, tawny, and dark-coloured, giving milk like sesamum, giving strength to him, may they be of all kinds, not giving any trouble."
3.9.2.2	Having put on the sacred thread, having sprinkled water, having placed the dead body in the place of the sacrificer, having kindled the worldly fire in the place of Garhapatya, having taken the right hand of the dead body, he recites: "O Jātavedas, come down and lead this dead body to heaven for the world, knowing, bestow life, progeny, and wealth on us, and enjoy all the offerings made to the dead."
3.8.2.26	Then he places the milk in a half-vessel towards the south, saying, "This is your share of food deposited in Yama's abode, your house. Your name is Akshiti." He takes the name of the sacrificer.
3.8.2.27	Having made it the deity, he performs the Sūdadohasa.
3.9.2.3	Then, having descended from the elephant, he should churn.
3.9.2.4	Having remained silent, filling the ladle with twelve spoonfuls, offering to Durga, Manasa, and the great formulas, offering the full oblation with two verses beginning with "Yama is the king," if the petitioners desire, he gives a cow to them.
3.8.2.28	He places the sacrificial grass with its roots towards the south, reciting, "We offer this sacrificial grass to the Fathers, to the Gods. We shall offer the living grass to the Fathers. You go up to that. Be fit for sacrifice. You are united with Yama and Yamī."
3.8.2.29	Having made it the deity, he performs the Sūdadohasa rite.
3.9.2.5	Now, when the sacrificer is absent, the direction is known.
3.9.2.6	Having made a resting place in that direction, having called him by his name, saying "Come", having made a human figure with the leaves of the Palasa tree, having placed the vessels over them, having covered them with fresh Kuśa grass, they should fast as prescribed.
3.8.2.30	Then he lays down the Naleṣikā (twig) with the verse, "One should mount the raft of reeds, follow the path by means of this reed. You become the raft of reeds and cross the stream."
3.8.2.31	Having made it the deity, he performs the Sūdadohasam.
3.9.2.7	If the sacrificer returns after the fire has been set up, what should he do?
3.9.3.1	Having kindled fire from sacrificial wood, having set up the fire, having strewn it, having made it face the fire, he offers with the two verses, "Hiranyagarbha, the golden embryo, came forth first."
3.8.2.32	Then, having cleansed the skull with a cloth that has been used for eating and drinking, he arranges it according to the limbs, saying, "O Earth, you have placed these bodies of ours on the lap of your mother. May they be well for you, O Earth."
3.9.3.2	Then he offers oblations of ghee with the verses beginning with "The Person has a thousand heads" and ending with "Svāhā".
3.9.3.3	From the Svishtakrit onwards, everything is accomplished up to the gift of the cow.
3.9.3.4	With a golden vessel or a new earthen vessel or a piece of black antelope skin, filled with ghee and water, he fills it up. If the father is alive, he recites the mantra, "May Vishnu create the womb."
3.9.3.5	Then he introduces him, saying, "O Pushan, send him to the most auspicious place."
3.9.3.6	He, having become a foetus, dwells in the night in the form of a garment made of black antelope skin.
3.9.3.7	When the night is over, he should draw himself out from the lower half of the womb and be born.
3.9.3.8	Having performed the rites of birth and others for the newborn, one should observe the vow for ten nights.
3.9.3.9	Having performed the Agnihotra rites with his wife, having performed the Vratya animal sacrifice, having gone to a mountain, one should offer an Isti to Agni Kama, consisting of a hundred black-coloured cows, for longevity.
3.9.3.10	Having worshipped in all directions, one should offer a sacrifice.
3.9.3.11	From here onwards, one should perform sacrifices with desired sacrificial rites.
3.8.2.34	Then he fans him with the wind, saying, "May the wind be auspicious, may the sun be auspicious, may all the plants be auspicious for thee. May the directions be auspicious for me.
3.9.3.12	It is known that the golden embryo, the Brahman, who has crossed over to the other shore, does not rise up for anyone, but he is equal to the gods.
3.9.3.13	Thus it is known.
3.9.3.14	Therefore, when the sacrificer is absent for twenty-four years, one should maintain the Agnihotra and perform the consecration. If he is not heard,
3.9.3.15	If a person who is observing the vow for the Agrayana sacrifice, the Iṣṭi sacrifice, the animal sacrifice, and the Cāturmāsya sacrifice dies in between, if his son or a student completes the remaining rites as a single rite,
3.9.3.16	he should offer a cake or cooked rice to the deity of the animal sacrifice.
3.9.3.17	Now, indeed, it is said, "He enters darkness from darkness." One should perform the rites for one who has died with other fires.
3.9.3.18	But they also say, "The fires become the inheritors of the body."
3.9.3.19	It is better to die.
3.8.2.35	Then he lays down five oblations with cakes, with butter, with rice-gruel, saying, "May the oblation with cake, with butter, and with rice-grucl come here. The creator of the heaven and earth, the creator of the path, the creator of offspring, the creator of all, the creator of heaven, the creator of earth, the creator who has created all, the creator who is the creator of all. The creator who has created the heaven and earth. The creator who is the maker of the path. The creator who created the offspring. The creator who made all. The creator of heaven. The creator of earth. The creator of all. He takes the name of the sacrificer, saying, "This is your share of butter, this is your share of rice-gruel. This is your share of cake. This is your portion of butter. This is your oblation of rice-grucl. This is your cake. This is the oblation of ricegruel. This oblation of cake. This oblation with butter. This is the portion of butter. Here is your oblation with rice-gruc1. This is your rice-gruel."
3.9.3.20	He who, knowing this, dies at the time of the northern solstice, goes to heaven by the solar path, and he who dies at the time when the sun is in the south, goes to the world of the Pitrs by the lunar path. This is known.
3.8.2.36	"Protect it, guard it, I give it to thee. Thy fathers have placed thee in it. May Prajapati place thee in it. Let it be firm like Angiras, with that deity." He places it in front.
3.9.3.21	They say that the sun and the moon are the two great supports of the world. By means of oblations, he is (reborn) in the night, in the dark fortnight, in the southern solstice, in the northern solstice, in the waxing fortnight, in the day, at the end of the sacrifice, and they instruct that death is better.
3.9.3.22	In other sacrifices which are regulated, they should do as in the case of one who dies while consecrated or in a single day which is not deficient.
3.8.2.37	He recites the verse, "He who desires Apūpa (cakes)..." towards the south. "He who desires milk..." towards the west. "He who possesses Apūpa and curd..." towards the north. "He who is endowed with Apūpa and honey..." towards the centre. "The one with a hundred syllables..." towards each direction. He recites the verses.
3.8.2.38	Having made the deity, he performs the Sūda dohsa.
3.10.1.1	Now, some quote here: "Some are silent, others are not."
3.10.1.2	"The woman is called the wife, the man is called the brahmin, they are the Hotr-rites, the others are without mantra-rites."
3.10.1.3	We shall explain them.
3.8.2.39	Then he covers him with cooked grains mixed with sesamum, saying, "These are thy sweet offerings, thy ambrosial ones."
3.8.2.40	Having made him a deity, he performs the Sūdadohasa rite.
3.8.2.41	Then he places four posts.
3.10.1.4	One who is not initiated, one who is mad, one who is dull, one who is blind, one who is dumb, one who is deaf, one who has leprosy, one who is lazy, one who is hunchbacked, one who is lame, one who is deficient in limbs, one who has excess limbs, one who is a companion of the world, a brahmin without a protector, a kshatriya without fire, a householder, a son born to a vaishya woman, a girl, a widow, and one who is barren.
3.10.1.5	When their lives have departed, bathe them silently.
3.10.1.6	Having taken the corpse to the cremation ground, one should cremate it without mantras.
3.10.1.7	Having rubbed and scattered sesamum and rice, having made a pyre, having placed the dead body on the pyre, having poured ghee into its mouth, he should say, "This is his body, this is his soul. The soul separates the soul from the body." "Bhuvar, Svar, Asau, for the world of heaven, svāhā."
3.10.1.8	They sprinkle with the mantra "Sigva" and "Vata".
3.10.1.9	He sprinkles silently with the water-pot, turning to the right.
3.10.1.10	He should join the fire with the Uddhatana fire, saying, "You are born from this, may this be born from you. To Agni Vaiśvānara, to the heavenly world, svāhā."
3.10.1.11	One should sprinkle at a sacred place.
3.10.2.1	Now, if the husband of a pregnant woman dies after the tenth month, the funeral rites should be performed by taking him to the cremation ground and offering him to the fire.
3.10.2.2	Having arranged the funeral pyre, the dead body should be placed on the left side of the pyre, and the inscription "Hiranyagarbhaḥ samavartata agre" should be written above it.
3.10.2.3	Seeing the prince, he says, "My son is alive."
3.10.2.4	Then they should bathe the prince.
3.10.2.5	Having hidden the gold, they return to the village.
3.8.3.1	The Brahmins know the milk of the herbs above the rice-balls. I have taken thee from among them for the rice-balls to be placed. The Arjuna-stalk, the Dūrvā-stalk, the Kāśa-stalk, the Darbha-stalk, the Pīlu-stalk, the Śyāmāka-stalk, the Kṛṣṇatīla-stalk, the Vīra-stalk, the Sūryā-stalk, and the Śālmali-stalk. The Arjuna-stalks are brought in front. The Dūrvā stalks are brought in the north. The Kāśa stalks are brought in back. The Darbha stalks are brought in south. The Pīlu stalks are brought in east. The Śyāmākas are brought in south-east. The Kṛṣṇatila stalks are brought in west. The Vīra stalks are brought in north-west. The Sūryā stalks are brought on the north. The Śālmali stalks are brought in northeast.
3.8.3.2	He places the pot of cooked rice in the middle of the four pillars, using the same four mantras.
3.8.3.3	Having made the deity, he performs the Sūdadausadhana.
3.10.2.6	Having given the breast to the one who says, "Your breast is like a hare," he offers oblations of ghee in the stomach with these five verses: "To the one with a hundred weapons, to the one with a thousand powers..." and concludes with "To Pravara, svāhā."
3.10.2.7	One should perform the rite with these verses: "To Prāṇa, svāhā! To Vyāna, svāhā!"
3.10.2.8	Having placed the deceased on the funeral pyre, one should cremate him according to the prescribed method.
3.8.3.4	Then he places four enclosing sticks of different trees, with the formulas, "May the trees not injure thee; may not thy mother injure thee. Thou art going to the world of Yama, where thou shalt shine." The two enclosing sticks of Vitex and of Smilax are in front and north.
3.8.3.5	Having made it a deity, he performs the Sūdadohasa rite.
3.8.3.6	Some do it with the formulas, Naleśīka.
3.8.3.7	Then he places the clods.
3.10.2.10	Now, if there is impurity among men, it is due to the birth or death of a brahmin, kṣatriya, vaiśya, or other castes. One should perform the rite with the five products of the cow, the Surabhimati verses, the Varuni verses, the Hiranyavarna verses, and the Pavamani verses. Having sprinkled with the Shatarudriya verses, one should give dakshina according to one's ability and then undertake the rites for the ancestors.
3.8.3.8	I place thee in the world of earth. May Prajapati place thee. Be thou firm according to that deity, like Angiras. He places a hundred in front, saying, "I place thee in the sky world." A hundred in the north, saying, "In the world of heaven." A hundred in back, saying, "Thee in the world of the quarters." A hundred in south, saying, " Thee in the world of quarters." "I place thee on the back of the sky, on the spreading of the Brahman." Two hundred in the middle.
3.10.3.1	Now, if a householder obtains many wives, and one of them dies, he should perform the rites for the dead in the fire.
3.10.3.2	Then he should observe a vow for ten days.
3.10.3.3	He should observe a vow such as sleeping on the ground, celibacy, wearing a garment of unwoven cloth, eating only once a day, not touching each other's bodies, and not eating each other's food.
3.8.3.9	Having made that the deity, he performs the Sūda-dohās.
3.8.3.10	Then he lays down the Lokampṛṇā bricks with the formula, "Thou fillest the world, thou fillest the void, thou fillest." With the Lokampṛnās, the number becomes a thousand.
3.8.3.11	In the case of the two thousand and four thousand bricks, one should lay down the same number again and again.
3.8.3.12	In the Kâthaka and Agnicita fires, one should lay the bricks eighty-five times.
3.10.3.4	and on other days of impurity.
3.10.3.5	On the eleventh day they perform the Ekoddiṣṭa.
3.10.3.6	Having kindled the fire with the other wives, the domestic rites are performed in it.
3.10.3.7	If a householder has many wives, and he dies before performing the rites of the Upavasatha, or if he dies after performing them, then the rites should be performed according to the prescribed rules. The body should be cremated in the fire.
3.10.3.8	From here onwards, the rites of the householder are performed by the other wives after kindling the fire.
3.8.3.13	Having known that one should offer the Sūtrāmaṇī sacrifice to Agni, or the Maitrāvaruṇa sacrifice with milk, this is the Brāhmaṇa of the Kāṭhaka Agni.
3.8.3.14	Having made it the deity, one performs the Sūda-dohās.
3.8.3.15	Then he fans it, saying, "May the wind be auspicious, may the sun be auspicious, may all the plants be auspicious for you, may all the directions be auspicious for you."
3.8.3.16	Then he touches him with the formula, "This is my protection from further distress and from the enemies. So has it been done by the Asvins, Mitra and Varuna."
3.8.3.17	He places the branch of the Vrana tree in front with the formula, "The god Vana-s-pati has protected this from distress, from ill-will and from hatred."
3.10.3.9	When one of them dies, having kindled the fire in the proper direction, having spread it around, having heated and wiped the ladle and spoon, having taken four spoonfuls in the ladle, the sacrificer offers with the wife standing by his side, saying, "Salutations to Tṛṣā, to Gadā, to Avadhayā, to Svadhā. May I not be injured by Indra. May I not suffer from your enemies. May I not have any misfortune. May I not go to the other world. May I not fall into the other world. Let there be no misfortune for me. Let there be nothing that is not Brahman for me. Svāhā!"
3.10.3.10	Then having placed the fire on it, he puts a twig on the other fire, with the formula, "This is thy proper place." With the two formulas, "O Agni, thou art invoked, do thou awaken."
3.8.3.18	He places the grass-blades towards the north with the formula, "Thou art the support; do thou support us from sin and hatred."
3.8.3.19	He places the twig of the Sami tree towards the west with the formula, “Thou art the Sami; do thou pacify us from sin and enmity."
3.8.3.20	He places barley towards the south with the formula, "Thou art the barley; do thou barley us from sin and hostility."
3.10.3.11	Having spread the clarified butter, having melted it, having heated the spoon and the ladle, having wiped them, having taken four spoonfuls of clarified butter, having begun with the right arm of the deceased, he offers with this verse, "He who is Brahma, who raised Brahma up."
3.8.3.21	Then he addresses him: "Go to the earth, go to the sky, go to heaven, go to the directions, go to heaven (again), go to the directions (again), go again to heaven, go again to the sky, and go again to the earth. Go to the waters, if that is beneficial to you. Stand in the plants with your bodies."
3.8.3.22	They make three furrows behind the pyre, facing south and east.
3.10.3.12	Taking up four handfuls of each, he cooks the rice in four pots, and having cooked it, having poured over it, having taken it out, having placed it, he pours over it.
3.8.3.23-27	That has been explained before. Having cut down the reeds with the leaves and branches, and having bound them with a weak iron rod, they move away. That has been explained before.
3.10.3.13	Having placed the Paridhana and other (materials) in front of the fire, he offers from the cooked (rice). Having recited the Puronuvākyā "May you both be united in your resolve", he offers with the Yājyā "O Agni, be the lord of the Pūriṣas, you are the lord of the fires."
3.10.3.14	He offers oblations of ghee on a stone or wood, reciting the Anuvāka ending with "You are the lord of Pūriṣa, O Agni".
3.8.3.28	Having thrice sprinkled water with the name, having crossed and sipped, he stands facing the sun, reciting, "We have risen from darkness."
3.8.3.29	Then they return home.
3.8.3.30	They do whatever the women here say.
3.8.3.31	Here they perform the Śānī rite. It is said that there is a reference to the Sautrāmaṇī.
3.8.3.32	Here one should perform with cooked barley.
3.10.3.15	The Svishtakrit and other rites are completed up to the gift of the cow.
3.10.3.16	The teacher gives the cow.
3.10.3.17	One should cremate according to the prescribed method.
3.10.3.18	After ten nights, the other rites are performed.
3.10.3.19	Having kindled the fire with the wives, the domestic rites are performed in that fire.
3.8.3.33	The Loṣṭa-oblation is concluded. The Loṣṭo-oblation is conluded.
3.9.1.1	Now if the sacrificer whose fire has been lost or carried away dies, if he has a son or a pupil who is fit for the rites,
3.10.4.1	Having bowed to Sadāśiva, the Supreme Lord, with the body, I shall describe the rite of the funeral ceremony of the dead in particular.
3.10.4.2	A householder brahmin with a pure soul should perform the rite of a renunciate, having placed the body on a stretcher and adorned with incense and garlands.
3.10.4.3	Having set fire to the chaff here, the performer should take the ascetic, having proclaimed victory with shouts and the sound of drums.
3.10.4.4	Having gone to the east or north, one should resort to a pure place, having dug it with the Vyāhṛtis, the measure of the length of the staff.
3.9.1.2	Having put on the sacred thread, having sprinkled water, having placed the dead body in the place of the sacrificer, having placed the kindling wood in the place of Garhapatya, having taken hold of the right arm of the dead body, he churns, saying, "Those who are the fires of him who offers oblations, desiring meat, may they be born as the sacrificer, may they lead this dead body to heaven for the enjoyment of the oblation."
3.10.4.5	Having sprinkled with the seven Vyāhrtis, he should make a wooden pyre there, either with sacrificial wood or with other wood, as much as possible.
3.10.4.6	Then having placed the body, with a pure mind, he should say, "O Vishnu, protect this body" and deposit the oblation in it.
3.9.1.3	Having remained silent, having filled the ladle with twelve spoonfuls, and having followed mentally with the Puruṣa Sūkta, he offers in the Āhavanīya.
3.9.1.4	He offers in the Gārhapatya with the same.
3.9.1.5	Having offered silently in the Anvāhāryapacaniya, he should proceed with the rites pertaining to the ancestors.
3.10.4.7	With the mantra "Obeisance to the sacred one," the sacred thread should be placed on the mouth. The three staffs should be placed in the right hand with the mantra "This is Vishnu, etc."
3.10.4.8	The pouch should be placed in with the mantra "What is this of his" ending with "Svaha". The vessel should be placed in his belly with the Savitri mantra, and the water pot in the secret place.
3.9.1.6	As it is said here, the bones of the deceased sacrificer are brought and purified.
3.9.1.7	How is the bringing here known?
3.9.1.8	It is known that one takes the bones in the order of head first, then chest, then belly, then thighs and arms, then the limbs, taking thirty-three bones. The Purusha is thirty-three.
3.10.4.9	Then he should establish the Kupaṇa with the mantra "Bhūmiḥ bhūmnā mama Agnēti".
3.10.4.10	The performer, along with all the means of worship scattered by the path, should worship the body with the Hotr priests and the planets. He should cremate the body with the fire of husks, and it will become the wind-gone.
3.9.1.9	Then having washed the bones with water, he spreads out the black antelope skin with its neck towards the south and with its hairy side upwards, and puts the bones on it with the verse, "Indra with the bones of Dadhici."
3.9.1.10	He makes it a deity with the verse, “May it be firm like Angiras with that deity.”
3.10.4.11	Thus, the learned who are skilled in the meaning of the Vedas cite it thus: The rites beginning with Viṣeka and ending with Śamāna are based on the Brāhmaṇa-s.
3.10.4.12	The householder performs the consecration of the deceased person as if it were a mantra, having established the fire within himself and cremating the dead body.
3.9.1.11	Then he performs the Sūdadohas (rites). The Pṛṣṇis, the Sūdadohasa rites, press Soma for him. The classes of gods are born in the three ascending regions of heaven.
3.9.1.12	They eat food from long-stemmed vessels, with salt and without salt, from earthen vessels.
3.9.1.13	Having deposited them on the boundary of the village, they should bring the fires.
3.10.4.13	His son, having duly consigned him to the fire, should cremate him, either according to the rules for the Hotr or with the Gayatri and Pranava.
3.10.4.14	If the father has died while the son is still alive, the son should perform the cremation, the Shraddha and the offering of water and balls of rice.
3.10.4.15	At the beginning, the Brahmachari should become a Yati, and then the Shraddha of the householder should be performed in his presence.
3.9.1.14	If the worldly fires were to be carried away, they would be lost.
3.9.1.15	But it is known that the sacrificer, before going away, gives his fires to someone else and then goes home.
3.9.1.16	They do not cross the boundary of the village.
3.9.1.17	Therefore, one should not carry the fires beyond the boundary of the house.
3.9.2.1	Now if the sacrificer should die while the fires are set up in him or on the kindling woods, or if his son or pupil is capable of performing the rites,
3.10.4.16	Carrying the dead body of a monk, burning, touching, one becomes pure by bathing alone. All of them attain the fruit of a horse sacrifice separately with their sons.
3.10.4.17	When the father, devoted to deeds, has renounced and passed away, his sons should not cremate him, but perform the śrāddha, piṇḍa, and water rituals.
3.9.2.2	Having put on the sacred thread, having sprinkled water, having placed the dead body in the place of the sacrificer, having kindled the worldly fire in the place of Garhapatya, having taken the right hand of the dead body, he recites: "O Jātavedas, come down and lead this dead body to heaven for the world, knowing, bestow life, progeny, and wealth on us, and enjoy all the offerings made to the dead."
3.10.4.18	For one who has renounced all attachments, who is devoted to meditation and yoga, there is no cremation, no impurity, and no water.
3.10.5.1	Now, we shall explain the purification ritual again.
3.10.5.2	If the body of a person made in the shape of a man with three hundred and sixty palāśa twigs on a black antelope skin were to perish, they perform the purification ritual again.
3.10.5.3	The number of oblations increases by one each day, and after three days, the fire should be extinguished. This is understood.
3.10.5.4	One should wrap the joints with palāśa bark or kuśa grass.
3.9.2.3	Then, having descended from the elephant, he should churn.
3.9.2.4	Having remained silent, filling the ladle with twelve spoonfuls, offering to Durga, Manasa, and the great formulas, offering the full oblation with two verses beginning with "Yama is the king," if the petitioners desire, he gives a cow to them.
3.10.5.5	He makes the head with forty, the neck with ten, the chest with twenty, the belly with thirty, the arms with fifty each, and the fingers of those with five each.
3.10.5.6	He makes each foot with seventy, and the fingers with five each.
3.9.2.5	Now, when the sacrificer is absent, the direction is known.
3.9.2.6	Having made a resting place in that direction, having called him by his name, saying "Come", having made a human figure with the leaves of the Palasa tree, having placed the vessels over them, having covered them with fresh Kuśa grass, they should fast as prescribed.
3.10.5.7	With eight (verses) the penis, with twelve the testicles.
3.10.5.8	Having bathed them, adorned them, and covered them with a new garment, having placed them inside the altar, the relatives sit around and recite the mantras: "This is Yama's, this is Yama's. These are the fires of Yama."
3.10.5.9	They undertake this initial rite.
3.11.1.1	Now we shall explain the offering to the dead.
3.9.2.7	If the sacrificer returns after the fire has been set up, what should he do?
3.9.3.1	Having kindled fire from sacrificial wood, having set up the fire, having strewn it, having made it face the fire, he offers with the two verses, "Hiranyagarbha, the golden embryo, came forth first."
3.9.3.2	Then he offers oblations of ghee with the verses beginning with "The Person has a thousand heads" and ending with "Svāhā".
3.9.3.3	From the Svishtakrit onwards, everything is accomplished up to the gift of the cow.
3.11.1.2	Having shaved the hair and beard, one should bathe and perform the water ritual.
3.11.1.3	In the eastern and southern directions, having smeared a square area with cow dung, placing a stone in the middle three times, scratching it once, sprinkling it with water, spreading darbha grass with the tips pointing towards the south, one should offer a ball of rice mixed with sesame, the size of a fist or an egg.
3.9.3.4	With a golden vessel or a new earthen vessel or a piece of black antelope skin, filled with ghee and water, he fills it up. If the father is alive, he recites the mantra, "May Vishnu create the womb."
3.9.3.5	Then he introduces him, saying, "O Pushan, send him to the most auspicious place."
3.11.1.4	With hair dishevelled, placing the left knee on the ground, he should offer the ball of rice on a stone.
3.11.1.5	He should offer this ball to him.
3.11.1.6	He should give unguent, ointment and clothes.
3.11.1.7	He should take water in a vessel and offer it clockwise.
3.11.1.8	Here the ghosts take it from the crow.
3.9.3.6	He, having become a foetus, dwells in the night in the form of a garment made of black antelope skin.
3.9.3.7	When the night is over, he should draw himself out from the lower half of the womb and be born.
3.9.3.8	Having performed the rites of birth and others for the newborn, one should observe the vow for ten nights.
3.9.3.9	Having performed the Agnihotra rites with his wife, having performed the Vratya animal sacrifice, having gone to a mountain, one should offer an Isti to Agni Kama, consisting of a hundred black-coloured cows, for longevity.
3.9.3.10	Having worshipped in all directions, one should offer a sacrifice.
3.9.3.11	From here onwards, one should perform sacrifices with desired sacrificial rites.
3.11.1.9	Thus, having performed the rites in the evening and morning, on the tenth day, having given the evening oblation, and having invited Brahmins at dusk, excluding those with deficient or excessive limbs, those with leprosy, nails, black teeth, diseases, those with prostitutes as wives, the insane, the sinful, and those who are pure, learned, well-behaved, accomplished in study, householders, poor, ritualistic, worthy vessels, those who can be known immediately, those connected with the same lineage, those who are skilled in rites, and those who have been explained, he should say, "This is what your father has decided, whatever is approved for the departed. May you all eat at my father's one-day śrāddha tomorrow."
3.11.1.10	The answer is that it is enjoyed.
3.11.2.1	On the eleventh day, they perform the Ekoddiṣṭa.
3.9.3.12	It is known that the golden embryo, the Brahman, who has crossed over to the other shore, does not rise up for anyone, but he is equal to the gods.
3.9.3.13	Thus it is known.
3.9.3.14	Therefore, when the sacrificer is absent for twenty-four years, one should maintain the Agnihotra and perform the consecration. If he is not heard,
3.11.2.2	Then, having invited a Brāhmaṇa at an auspicious time, having given him something and informed him, he says, "Tomorrow, having prepared food, give it to a Brāhmaṇas who have shaved their beards, hair, and nails, having given him a tooth-stick, having touched the wealth, grain, and vessel, having given the vessel etc. in the country, he should make the Brāhmaṇa sit facing north.
3.9.3.15	If a person who is observing the vow for the Agrayana sacrifice, the Iṣṭi sacrifice, the animal sacrifice, and the Cāturmāsya sacrifice dies in between, if his son or a student completes the remaining rites as a single rite,
3.9.3.16	he should offer a cake or cooked rice to the deity of the animal sacrifice.
3.9.3.17	Now, indeed, it is said, "He enters darkness from darkness." One should perform the rites for one who has died with other fires.
3.9.3.18	But they also say, "The fires become the inheritors of the body."
3.9.3.19	It is better to die.
3.11.2.3	He should give water mixed with sesamum seeds, except when he is offering libations.
3.11.2.4	When the vessel is covered with a single cloth, he should bring water, purify it with the Pavitra, mix sesamum seeds in it, and place it on the Darbha grass. He then covers it with Darbha grass.
3.11.2.5	Having given fragrance etc. to the Brahmin, he says, "I am offering the ball."
3.11.2.6	The reply is "Offer the ball."
3.9.3.20	He who, knowing this, dies at the time of the northern solstice, goes to heaven by the solar path, and he who dies at the time when the sun is in the south, goes to the world of the Pitrs by the lunar path. This is known.
3.11.2.7	Then he should place the ball on the darbha grass, saying: "May this rice be a wish-yielding cow, inexhaustible, fragrant, fulfilling all desires. May it stand before you, immortal, always existing, yielding nectar. May it satisfy the immortals."
3.11.2.8	Having given one ball, he sprinkles the water with sesame seeds. "They are the goddesses of nourishment, worshipped with oblations, the goddesses who bestow nourishment, the goddesses who carry nourishment, the goddesses of oblation, the goddesses of inexhaustible water, milk, water, ghee, honey, juice, and the flowing liquid."
3.9.3.21	They say that the sun and the moon are the two great supports of the world. By means of oblations, he is (reborn) in the night, in the dark fortnight, in the southern solstice, in the northern solstice, in the waxing fortnight, in the day, at the end of the sacrifice, and they instruct that death is better.
3.9.3.22	In other sacrifices which are regulated, they should do as in the case of one who dies while consecrated or in a single day which is not deficient.
3.11.2.9	Having adorned the ball with Anjanā and other things, having worshipped the Brāhmaṇa, having taken hold of the root of the thumb, he says, "Eat." Having said, "Let us eat," and then eating, having placed the leftovers of all, having scattered the grass at the end of eating, the Brāhmaṇas should say, "The vessel is well-eaten."
3.11.2.10	Then having placed the sacred thread, and having said loudly, "May there be Svāhā," the reply is, "Let there be Svāha."
3.11.2.11	Having sprinkled with the sacrificial thread, having given the gift, having risen, he says, "What should be done with the remaining food?"
3.11.2.12	The reply is, "May it be enjoyed with the desired ones."
3.10.1.4	One who is not initiated, one who is mad, one who is dull, one who is blind, one who is dumb, one who is deaf, one who has leprosy, one who is lazy, one who is hunchbacked, one who is lame, one who is deficient in limbs, one who has excess limbs, one who is a companion of the world, a brahmin without a protector, a kshatriya without fire, a householder, a son born to a vaishya woman, a girl, a widow, and one who is barren.
3.10.1.5	When their lives have departed, bathe them silently.
3.10.1.6	Having taken the corpse to the cremation ground, one should cremate it without mantras.
3.11.2.13	Having circumambulated, having returned, having abandoned the alms in water, having bathed, having entered the temple, having made the right hand free, having made the añjali, having adorned, having come to the house, having recited the auspicious days, etc., the group eats the remaining food.
3.11.2.14	He sees his son, he sees his grandson, and he is not born as the remnant of a Śūdra. This is said by Kuśahārita.
3.11.3.1	The Śrāddha rite of Sapandīkaraṇa should be performed in the year.
3.10.1.7	Having rubbed and scattered sesamum and rice, having made a pyre, having placed the dead body on the pyre, having poured ghee into its mouth, he should say, "This is his body, this is his soul. The soul separates the soul from the body." "Bhuvar, Svar, Asau, for the world of heaven, svāhā."
3.10.1.8	They sprinkle with the mantra "Sigva" and "Vata".
3.11.3.2	Having placed the fire in front, having spread darbha grass with their tips towards the south and east, having placed four water pots on them, having purified the sprinkling water with a single strainer, having sprinkled the pots, having placed one of them to the right as the pot for the departed, having brought a pot with half water, having purified it with the strainer, having filled it with sesame seeds, having placed it on the darbha grass, he covers it with darbha grass.
3.10.1.9	He sprinkles silently with the water-pot, turning to the right.
3.10.1.10	He should join the fire with the Uddhatana fire, saying, "You are born from this, may this be born from you. To Agni Vaiśvānara, to the heavenly world, svāhā."
3.10.1.11	One should sprinkle at a sacred place.
3.11.3.4	Having placed the pitcher of water on the right side, he makes the Brahmins sit facing east on the Darbha grass seats, having washed their hands and feet well, and the other gods facing north, and says, "May you attain." The others reply, "We have attained."
3.10.2.1	Now, if the husband of a pregnant woman dies after the tenth month, the funeral rites should be performed by taking him to the cremation ground and offering him to the fire.
3.10.2.2	Having arranged the funeral pyre, the dead body should be placed on the left side of the pyre, and the inscription "Hiranyagarbhaḥ samavartata agre" should be written above it.
3.11.3.5	Having offered worship to them, except for incense and lamps, he sprinkles water in a counter-clockwise direction.
3.11.3.6	Having placed an Udumbara wood fire, he offers with an Udumbara ladle.
3.10.2.3	Seeing the prince, he says, "My son is alive."
3.10.2.4	Then they should bathe the prince.
3.10.2.5	Having hidden the gold, they return to the village.
3.11.3.7	Having offered oblations with ghee fit for offering, with the six mantras beginning with "To Soma, the father of the fathers," he then offers with names, saying "Svāhā to him, salutations to him" - eight oblations.
3.11.3.8	He offers these eight.
3.10.2.6	Having given the breast to the one who says, "Your breast is like a hare," he offers oblations of ghee in the stomach with these five verses: "To the one with a hundred weapons, to the one with a thousand powers..." and concludes with "To Pravara, svāhā."
3.10.2.7	One should perform the rite with these verses: "To Prāṇa, svāhā! To Vyāna, svāhā!"
3.10.2.8	Having placed the deceased on the funeral pyre, one should cremate him according to the prescribed method.
3.11.3.9	Having thus offered the oblation to Agni, the conveyor of oblations, to Svishtakrit, with the words "Svāhā, salutations to Svāhā", having offered and sprinkled the ladle in the southeastern quarter, having sprinkled the Darbha grass with the ladle in a counter-clockwise direction, having spread Darbha grass with their tips pointing towards the south, he should place one Preta ball on them, saying, "This is the Odanaka, the wish-yielding cow".
3.10.2.9	One should give a cow for the Aṣṭaka rite, a cow for sesame seeds, or a cow for land.
3.11.3.10	"Having sprinkled them with sesame water, having given these balls of rice, having touched them with faith, he approaches the Brahmanas who know the Veda, saying, 'Eat!'
3.11.3.11	He looks at those who are eating, saying, 'I offer the immortal in the life-force, my Self for immortality.'
3.10.2.10	Now, if there is impurity among men, it is due to the birth or death of a brahmin, kṣatriya, vaiśya, or other castes. One should perform the rite with the five products of the cow, the Surabhimati verses, the Varuni verses, the Hiranyavarna verses, and the Pavamani verses. Having sprinkled with the Shatarudriya verses, one should give dakshina according to one's ability and then undertake the rites for the ancestors.
3.11.3.12	He should recite the Rig and Yajur verses with the names of the ancestors.
3.11.3.13	After giving water mixed with sesame seeds to those who have finished eating, he should recite "May there be Svāhā" and the reply should be "May there be svadhā."
3.11.3.14	Having given dakṣiṇā according to one's ability, then he should place the preta vessel in the pitṛ vessels, reciting "May there be a common intention."
3.10.3.1	Now, if a householder obtains many wives, and one of them dies, he should perform the rites for the dead in the fire.
3.10.3.2	Then he should observe a vow for ten days.
3.10.3.3	He should observe a vow such as sleeping on the ground, celibacy, wearing a garment of unwoven cloth, eating only once a day, not touching each other's bodies, and not eating each other's food.
3.11.3.15	Then he should place the Preta-ball among the Pitṛ-balls, saying, "May you be united, may you be in harmony, the same mantra, the same assembly." With these two verses.
3.11.3.16	He stands before them, saying, "Those who are equal, those who are of the same lineage." With these two.
3.11.3.17	Here he recites the Paiṭhīka Anuvāka, saying, "We call you, O Ushanas."
3.11.3.18	The rites for the father should be performed afterwards.
3.10.3.4	and on other days of impurity.
3.10.3.5	On the eleventh day they perform the Ekoddiṣṭa.
3.10.3.6	Having kindled the fire with the other wives, the domestic rites are performed in it.
3.11.3.19	One should eat after having given a portion to Śeṣa.
3.11.3.20	This is the rite of feeding the departed ancestors.
3.11.4.1	Now we shall explain the rite of Narayana.
3.11.4.2	It should be performed on the twelfth day of the dark fortnight in the southern and northern transits of the sun.
3.11.4.3	One invites twelve or six Brahmins who are learned and virtuous.
3.10.3.7	If a householder has many wives, and he dies before performing the rites of the Upavasatha, or if he dies after performing them, then the rites should be performed according to the prescribed rules. The body should be cremated in the fire.
3.10.3.8	From here onwards, the rites of the householder are performed by the other wives after kindling the fire.
3.10.3.9	When one of them dies, having kindled the fire in the proper direction, having spread it around, having heated and wiped the ladle and spoon, having taken four spoonfuls in the ladle, the sacrificer offers with the wife standing by his side, saying, "Salutations to Tṛṣā, to Gadā, to Avadhayā, to Svadhā. May I not be injured by Indra. May I not suffer from your enemies. May I not have any misfortune. May I not go to the other world. May I not fall into the other world. Let there be no misfortune for me. Let there be nothing that is not Brahman for me. Svāhā!"
3.11.4.4	Having drawn the image of the deity in a temple or on the bank of a river, and having performed the rites from the beginning, one should stand up and invoke the deity in front of the fire. "Om, I invoke the Purusha. Om, I invoke the Bhuva Purusha. Om I invoke the Suva Purusha. I invoke the Puruṣa of Bhuḥ, Bhuvaḥ, and Suva. Having invoked thus, one should perform the rites from the mouth of the fire, worship the deity, and sprinkle oneself with the three verses beginning with "The waters are firm, the bountiful ones..." and the four verses beginning with "Golden-colored, pure, and radiant..." and the Anuvāka beginning with "Pavamāna, the golden-born..." Having sprinkled oneself with this Anuvāka, one should offer oblations with unbroken grains, fragrances, flowers, incense, and lamps, or with the eight-syllable mantra.

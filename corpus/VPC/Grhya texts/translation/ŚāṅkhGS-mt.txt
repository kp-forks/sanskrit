1.1.12	The times for offering the fire oblation have been explained in the Agnihotra section.
1.1.13	And the statement "wearing the sacred thread" and so on, which is possible, is due to the oneness of the imagination.

1.3.8	Some people think that the morning oblation should be offered at the time of the evening oblation, because it has passed.

Whatever my mother has desired, wandering without a husband, may my father destroy that seed, and may another be deposited in my mother's womb. Svāhā. Thus, in place of the four great formulas, one should recite this.
4.4.12	May the ancestors, beginning with Nandin, be pleased, in the imperishable place.
4.4.13	One who is going to recite the ancestors beginning with Nandin says so in the recitation.
4.4.14	"The question of satisfaction is said to be "accomplished."
4.4.15	What is similar is what is not contradictory.
4.5.1	Now the offering.
4.5.2	At the appearance of herbs, by hand or by hearing,
3.13.6	Rice-gruel or cooked rice.
3.13.7	The Anvaṣṭaka sacrifice is performed on the next day, with the Pinda-pitryajña.
3.14.1	One offers cakes on the Utkāma day.
3.14.2	The Ukthya and Atirātra are performed together. The Apūpakṛt is performed on the same day as the Chanda. "Obeisance to you, O you having a smiling face, O you having the name of Svāhā."
3.14.3	A goat or a sheep or a pot-cooked rice.
3.14.4	Or one may offer a mouthful of grass.
4.5.3-7	Some say that one should offer oblations of unbroken grains and cooked rice mixed with curds and ghee, reciting each verse separately. Some say that one should recite the verses and sections of the Veda. Mandukya says that one should recite them according to the chapters and verses of the Veda. Then Kauṣītaki said: "Agni is the priest in front" is one verse.
3.14.5	If he is in the forest, he should offer the oblation in a pot. This is my eighth.
3.14.6	One should not do it, one should not do it.
4.1.1	One should give to the ancestors every month.
4.1.2	Having seated the Brahmins who know the Vedas, an odd number, three and a half, like the ancestors,
4.1.3	Having scattered odd-numbered water pots with sesame seeds,
4.5.8	Kusumbaka said this: "O bird, speak well. Singing, you have approached the abode of Jamadagni. The entire universe is dependent on you. O Agni, go to the sacrifice with the Maruts. O one who is to be appeased, tell us what is ours. O Agni, know and go. O King, the offered oblation is heard." These are two verses.
4.1.4	Having directed them thus, he should place it in the hands of the Brahmanas.
4.1.5	From now on, they are adorned.
4.1.6	Having invited them, having offered oblations to the fire,
4.1.7	having directed them thus, one should feed them.
4.1.8	While they are eating, one should recite the great formulas, the Savitri, the Madhuvattiya, the Pitridevatiya, and the Pavamana verses.
4.5.9	"We have chosen this, the best of all."
4.5.10	They eat the remaining oblation with the verse, "I have done what was to be done by Dadhikravan."
4.5.11	Having sipped water and sat down,
4.5.12	he recites the great formulas, Savitri, and the auspicious verses beginning with the Vedas.
4.5.13	Having greeted the teacher with "May there be welfare,"
4.5.14	This is also said:
4.5.15	The sages, desiring the perfection of the rites, the excellence of the hymns, and the non-deterioration of the rites, saw the Upakrama through the power of austerities.
4.5.16	Therefore, those who desire the accomplishment of the rites say that the Upakraman should be performed by one who is always engaged in the six rites for the accomplishment of the mantras.
4.1.9	He should give the balls to those who have eaten.
4.1.10	Some do it in front.
4.1.11	The balls of the wives of the Brahmins should be hidden a little.
4.1.12	He should offer the remaining to the Brahmins.
4.1.13	The Ekoddiṣṭa rite is explained in the Kalpa, which begins with the Agnikarana and ends with the Piṇḍapitṛyajña.
4.2.1	Now, the Ekoddiṣța rite.
4.2.2	One sacred thread.
4.2.3	One offering.
4.2.4	One ball.
4.2.5	No invocation, no offering to fire, no "the world of gods is satisfied" here. The question of satisfaction should be asked at the place of imperishability.
4.2.6	The dismissal is "May you be pleased."
4.2.7	Thus for a year for the departed.
4.2.8	And the fourth dismissal.
4.3.1	Now the offering to the ancestors.
4.3.2	After a year or three fortnights.
4.3.3	Or on the day when prosperity would occur.
4.5.17	And at the Upakarman and Utsarga, the expiation should be for three nights. At the Astakas, it should be for one day and night, and at the Rtuantya nights, it should be one night.
4.6.1	On the first day of the bright fortnight of Magha.
4.6.2	In the direction of Aparajita.
4.6.3	In a place with many medicinal herbs.
4.6.4	Having recited the Surya mantras, "O Jatavedas, the bright one, the god, the protector, the sun, may it protect us from heaven."
4.3.4	Having prepared four water-vessels with rice and fragrant water,
4.3.5	three for the ancestors and one for the departed.
4.3.6	He sprinkles the departed's vessel into the vessels of the ancestors, saying "Those who are equal" twice.
4.3.7	Similarly, the ball of food.
4.3.8	This is the offering to the ancestors.
4.4.1	Now, the rites for prosperity.
4.4.2	In the waxing fortnight, on an auspicious day,
4.4.3	Having performed the Mother's sacrifice,
4.6.5	"The great one is here, the great one is there," (thus) they place the clods in the opposite directions, reciting the verse.
4.6.6	Having gratified the sages, the metres, the deities, and the ancestors, he should then gratify the ancestors of each person.
4.6.7	They rest the metres for half the seventh months.
4.6.8	Or for half the sixth months.
4.6.9	If they are studying, they should stop for a day and night before resuming their studies.
4.4.4	Having seated the couples who know the Vedas,
4.4.5	in the morning,
4.4.6	the act of circumambulating is the offering.
4.4.7	Recitation except for the Pitṛ mantras.
4.4.8	Darbha grass is straight.
4.4.9	Yava is the meaning of sesame.
4.4.10	The balls are mixed with curd, jujube and ghee.
4.4.11	"One should invite the Pitṛs with the words, 'I am inviting the Pitṛs who are at the gate of heaven.' In the invitation,"
4.7.1	Then, for a cessation.
4.7.2	In calamities, until the time is right.
4.7.3	In other miracles.
4.7.4	In lightning, thunder, and rain, for three junctions.
4.7.5	For one day in a funeral feast.
4.7.6	For ten days in a birth or death.
4.7.7	On the fourteenth and new moon days, and in the Aṣṭakās.
4.7.8	On the days of the new moon and the full moon, and in the Navarātras.
4.7.9	And when the teacher has passed away, for ten days.
4.4.12	May the ancestors, beginning with Nandin, be pleased, in the imperishable place.
4.4.13	One who is going to recite the ancestors beginning with Nandin says so in the recitation.
4.4.14	"The question of satisfaction is said to be "accomplished."
4.4.15	What is similar is what is not contradictory.
4.5.1	Now the offering.
4.5.2	At the appearance of herbs, by hand or by hearing,
4.7.10	After hearing, for three nights.
4.7.11	And for those who have performed the rites before that.
4.7.12	In accepting, like a śrāddha.
4.7.13	With a fellow student.
4.7.14	Having followed the departed one.
4.7.15	And having placed the balls of rice for the ancestors.
4.7.16	For the night.
4.7.17	For the twilight.

4.5.3-7	Some say that one should offer oblations of unbroken grains and cooked rice mixed with curds and ghee, reciting each verse separately. Some say that one should recite the verses and sections of the Veda. Mandukya says that one should recite them according to the chapters and verses of the Veda. Then Kauṣītaki said: "Agni is the priest in front" is one verse.

4.7.25	From one who is not visible.
4.7.26	From one whose voice is not heard.

O one who is to be appeased, tell us what is ours. O Agni, know and go. O King, the offered oblation is heard." These are two verses.

4.7.51	They should study when they have passed.
4.5.9	"We have chosen this, the best of all."
4.5.10	They eat the remaining oblation with the verse, "I have done what was to be done by Dadhikravan."
4.5.11	Having sipped water and sat down,
4.5.12	he recites the great formulas, Savitri, and the auspicious verses beginning with the Vedas.
4.5.13	Having greeted the teacher with "May there be welfare,"
4.5.14	This is also said:

4.7.54	That is also this.
4.5.15	The sages, desiring the perfection of the rites, the excellence of the hymns, and the non-deterioration of the rites, saw the Upakrama through the power of austerities.

4.7.55	Food, water, roots, fruits, and whatever else is offered as a śrāddha, having accepted it, one is not prohibited from studying. A brahmin is said to be one who eats with his hand.

2.14.14	These are the obstacles that prevent princes who possess these characteristics from attaining the kingdom.
2.14.28	Thereafter, having spread darbha grass facing all directions at a village-crossroad, a town-crossroad, or a city-crossroad, he offers oblations in a new basket.

2.14.25	Having prepared all fragrances, all tastes, all herbs, and all gems, one should offer honey, curd, and ghee.

Give me brilliance, O Brilliant One! Give me fame, O Famed One! Give me sons, O Sonful One! Give all desires to me, O All-Having One!"
2.14.31	Then, after the sun has risen, in a clear sky, at an auspicious time, offer worship to the sun and give salutations, saying: "Salutations to you, O Blessed One, O Hundred-rayed One, O Remover of Darkness, O God, remove my misfortune and unite me with good fortune."
2.14.32	Then comes the offering to the Brahmins:
2.14.33	The bull is the Dakshina (offering).
2.14.26	Having thus collected these requisites, having ascended the skin of a bull, he consecrates the thousand-eyed one with the hundred streams, purified by the sages. With those, I consecrate you.

Whatever misfortune there is in your hair, in the parting of your hair, on your forehead, on your cheeks, in your ears, in your eyes, may the waters always destroy it. Varuna the king gives you good fortune, Surya gives you good fortune. Brihaspati gives you good fortune; Indra and Vayu give you good fortune; the seven sages give you good fortune.
2.14.27	Having bathed, at night, he offers four oblations on the head with mustard oil, pressed on the same day, using a ladle made of Udumbara wood, saying, "To Śālakaṭaṅkaṭa, svāhā! To the son of the king of Kūṣmāṇḍa, svāha! To Uṣmīta, svāhā!"
2.15.1	If one sees a bad dream, having offered sesame seeds with the Vyāhṛtis, one should stand facing the directions. May Bodha and Pratibodha protect me from the front, Aswapan and Manavadraṇa from the right, Gopayama and Rakṣamāṇa from the back, Jagrvi and Mārunḍatī from the left, Viṣṇu and the earth, and the serpents from below, Bṛhaspatis and the Viśve Devas, and the sky from above, protect me.
2.15.2	Thus, when it arises, one should suspect misfortune.
2.15.3	Having offered sesame seeds with the Vyāhṛtis, one should undertake austerity for twelve nights, six nights, three nights, or one night.
2.15.4	If one thinks it is a calamity, or if it is so.
2.15.5	If the earth is broken on a parvan day, one should strike in water with the mantra, "O king, may the earth be firm. Go to your source. Svāhā."
2.14.28	Thereafter, having spread darbha grass facing all directions at a village-crossroad, a town-crossroad, or a city-crossroad, he offers oblations in a new basket.

May Indra, the increaser of wealth, grant us welfare. May Pusan, the knower of all, grant us welfare; may Tarkshya, the one with the uninjured wheel, grant us welfare, may Brihaspati grant us welfare. May the Asvins, Bhaga, and the divine Aditi, the unaging one, grant us welfare! May Pusan, Asura, grant us welfare: may heaven and earth grant us welfare with good counsel. For welfare we invoke Vayu, Soma, the lord of the universe, Brihaspati, the all-knowing one, for welfare. May the Adityas grant us welfare. All the gods grant us welfare today. May Vaishvanara, the Vasu Agni, grant us welfare.
2.14.31	Then, after the sun has risen, in a clear sky, at an auspicious time, offer worship to the sun and give salutations, saying: "Salutations to you, O Blessed One, O Hundred-rayed One, O Remover of Darkness, O God, remove my misfortune and unite me with good fortune."
2.14.32	Then comes the offering to the Brahmins:
2.14.33	The bull is the Dakshina (offering).
2.15.7	The same as in the case of Jaya.
2.16.1	One who is afraid of serpents, having cooked a single-potful oblation to Bhūmi on the Śrāvaṇī day, and having ground the rice and barley, and having spread Darbha grass on the ground prepared by himself, offers the oblation with the formula, "To Bhūmi, to the firm, to the steady, svāhā."
2.16.2	He stands up with the formulas, "Samīcī was the name," repeating them twice in each direction and twice in the middle.
2.15.1	If one sees a bad dream, having offered sesame seeds with the Vyāhṛtis, one should stand facing the directions. May Bodha and Pratibodha protect me from the front, Aswapan and Manavadraṇa from the right, Gopayama and Rakṣamāṇa from the back, Jagrvi and Mārunḍatī from the left, Viṣṇu and the earth, and the serpents from below, Bṛhaspatis and the Viśve Devas, and the sky from above, protect me.
2.15.2	Thus, when it arises, one should suspect misfortune.
2.15.3	Having offered sesame seeds with the Vyāhṛtis, one should undertake austerity for twelve nights, six nights, three nights, or one night.
2.15.4	If one thinks it is a calamity, or if it is so.
2.16.3	Some say, "To the Lord of Serpents." "Thou art a serpent, thou art the lord of serpents. Let all serpents be the bearers of oblations. Let the serpents pay homage. Let them not injure, let them not harm, let them not bite. Let the serpents not injure us. O Agni, do thou not let loose the serpents, the evil-doers, the enemies, the ill-wishers, the haters, the destroyers, the tormentors, the injurers, the violent ones. Do thou destroy them, O thou of a thousand powers. Thou art a serpent, the lord of serpents, thou savest men with food, and serpents with cakes. Let them not bite me who are in thee, or in me. Let the serpents injure us not. Let the serpents be paid homage to by these three verses."
2.15.5	If the earth is broken on a parvan day, one should strike in water with the mantra, "O king, may the earth be firm. Go to your source. Svāhā."
2.16.4	"I give you this Dhruva." He gives the names of all the ministers and himself.
2.16.5	For four months, taking the serpent-offering, he should desist by this Dharma.
2.16.6	Even silently, a Śūdra with washed hands.
2.15.6	If the sacrificial post is burnt, destroyed, falls down, is broken, is shaken, or if the pot is broken, or if the pots are mixed up, or if the door-post is split, or if a cow is milked, or if a woman strikes another woman, or if there is a collision of ploughs, or if the pestle falls down, or if the mortar is broken, or in any other wonder, one should offer with these (verses).

2.17.1	When the pigeon, frightened and without its flock, has entered the house, its foot may be seen in the fire, in the butter, in the wood, or in the oil. The gods, the pigeon, is sent by Yama, the messenger of Death, to come here. Therefore let us make atonement and propitiation. May there be peace for us, for the bipeds and for the quadrupeds. May the pigeon, sent by Yama, be auspicious to us. The gods, may the bird not be a misfortune in the house. Agni, the priest, may he enjoy our oblation. May the winged curse not strike us. The winged curse does not strike us. It makes a place for us in the house of Yama. May there be well-being for our cattle and for men. May the pigeon not harm us here, O gods. When the owl speaks, it is in vain. When the pigeon makes a place in the fire, it is because this messenger has been sent by him. To Yama, to Death, let us offer salutations. With this verse, drive away the pigeon, rejoicing, enjoying food, leading the cattle around. Binding together all the evils, may it go away from the place of nourishment. Thus it is said.
2.15.7	The same as in the case of Jaya.
2.16.1	One who is afraid of serpents, having cooked a single-potful oblation to Bhūmi on the Śrāvaṇī day, and having ground the rice and barley, and having spread Darbha grass on the ground prepared by himself, offers the oblation with the formula, "To Bhūmi, to the firm, to the steady, svāhā."
2.16.2	He stands up with the formulas, "Samīcī was the name," repeating them twice in each direction and twice in the middle.
2.17.2	Having taken the step, they go to the south.
2.17.3	They go with the Adhvaryu.
2.17.4	Having placed the step in the furrow made by himself, he goes along.
2.17.5	They sprinkle the cowpen with three verses, "O Agni, do thou purify our life, Agni is the sage, O Agni, do thou be purified."
2.17.6	Not looking back, they go back.
2.17.7	Having returned, they recite the verses, "O god Agni, do thou cleanse our life, Agni, the sage, O god Agni, do you be purified."
2.18.1	One who desires a son should offer six oblations on the first day.
2.16.3	Some say, "To the Lord of Serpents." "Thou art a serpent, thou art the lord of serpents. Let all serpents be the bearers of oblations. Let the serpents pay homage. Let them not injure, let them not harm, let them not bite. Let the serpents not injure us. O Agni, do thou not let loose the serpents, the evil-doers, the enemies, the ill-wishers, the haters, the destroyers, the tormentors, the injurers, the violent ones.

2.16.4	"I give you this Dhruva." He gives the names of all the ministers and himself.
2.16.5	For four months, taking the serpent-offering, he should desist by this Dharma.
2.16.6	Even silently, a Śūdra with washed hands.
2.18.2	Having cooked the oblation of rice in milk, he offers it. May Agni, united with Brahman, the destroyer of Rakshas, drive away from here the evil-named one who harms your embryo and the one who harms your womb. The one who harms your unborn embryo and the one harming your womb, Agni, together with Brahman, drove away the one who eats the dead. The one who kills your husband, the one who is sitting, the one who creeps, the one who harms the born, we drive him away from here. The one who, having deceived you with sleep and darkness, lies down, the one who seeks to harm your offspring, we drive him from here. The brother who becomes your husband, the lover who becomes your husband - the one who seeks harm to your offspring, we destroy him from here. Those who kill you, the Apsarases, the Gandharvas, the ones who eat the dead, the one who belongs to the gods, we destroy him here. The one between the couple who lies down, the lover who lies between the two, we destroy him. The one who has a broken egg, the one with an enlarged embryo, the one who has not died, the one who gives birth to pigs, may she give birth, may she be the one who gives. May Vishnu create the womb, may Tvashtri fashion the forms, may Prajapati sprinkle, may the creator place the embryo in you. Place the embryo, O Sinivali, place the embryo, O Sarasvati. May the two Ashvins, the gods with lotus garlands, place the embryo in your womb. The golden kindling wood, which the Ashvins churned, that embryo we invoke for you in the tenth month for delivery. O Death, follow the path beyond this, the one that is other than the path of the gods. To the one who sees and hears, I say this: Do not harm our offspring or our heroes. The twelve goddesses of pregnancy, the first six are of the oblation of cooked rice, the last six are of ghee.
2.18.3	The same as Jaya and others.
2.17.1	When the pigeon, frightened and without its flock, has entered the house, its foot may be seen in the fire, in the butter, in the wood, or in the oil.

2.18.2	Having cooked the oblation of rice in milk, he offers it. May Agni, united with Brahman, the destroyer of Rakshas, drive away from here the evil-named one who harms your embryo and the one who harms your womb. The one who harms your unborn embryo and the one harming your womb, Agni, together with Brahman, drove away the one who eats the dead. The one who kills your husband, the one who is sitting, the one who creeps, the one who harms the born, we drive him away from here.

2.18.3	The same as Jaya and others.
2.18.4	Having cooked the flesh of a goat, having offered six oblations, let the goat fall down. Let the son fall down again. Again place the son for this one who desires a son. If a man is born, as this earth has placed a foetus on me, lying down, so place that foetus in the tenth month for delivery. With Vishnu's supreme form, place a male son in this cow-like woman, in the tenth month, for delivery. Having approached the Pākayajñas, with one ghee and one sacrificial grass, one should perform one Svishtakrit, even though the deities are different. Even though the deities are separate.

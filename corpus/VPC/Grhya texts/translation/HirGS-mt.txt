1.12.15	He says each one of them, "Kurch", "Anusandhi", "Anupkichaya" and "Vaca".
1.12.16	"Kurch" means foot-stool.
1.12.17	One sits facing east on it, saying, "May the teacher's seat be the support of the kingdom today."
1.12.18	Then he says to him, "This is water for washing the feet."

1.13.8	Having taken it with both hands in the Savitrī-form, he places it on the navel of the earth, saying, "In the place of Ida." Having placed it on the earth, he says, "May I be the supreme eater of honey by this supreme form of honey, the supreme eater of food." Having joined the thumb and the middle finger three times in a clockwise direction, he eats it three times, saying, "I eat for brilliance, prosperity, fame, strength, and food." He gives the leftovers to the one who has a share in it.
1.13.9	"All this is the covering of nectar." He sips water with this verse.

He gives the leftovers to the one who has a share in it.
1.13.12	Let the cow, the milch cow, the mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the sister of the Adityas, the navel of immortality, be praised for you, for the healing people. Do not kill the cow, the non-cow, Aditi. Drink water, eat grass, and let go of what is yours." This is said in the context of letting go.
1.13.9	"All this is the covering of nectar." He sips water with this verse.
1.13.10	Then he says to him, "This is a cow."
1.13.11	The rite of releasing it is done.
1.13.13	When the cow is being killed, he says, "May the cow be free from sin; may it remove my sin and that of this (person). May my enemy be killed. May my enemy be made to kill."
1.13.14	When the meat is being offered to him after preparing the food with some other meat, he says, “This is for the departed soul.”
1.13.15	That is the good, that is the Viraḍ food, that is the food of the gods, that is the nourishing food, that is to be given, that is the good. Having said this, he then says, "Feed the Brahmins."
1.13.16	When they have eaten, he serves them with the leftover food.
1.13.17	May heaven accept it. May earth give it. May earth accept it. May heaven give it. May the breath accept it. May the life accept it. May life eat it. May life drink it.

1.14.2	If one wishes to have a minister, a student, or a servant, one should go to his house in the evening, having bathed, wearing clean clothes, having spoken with a brahmin, and having waited for the day. Having urinated on the tip of a living plant, one should sprinkle the house three times while circumambulating it, saying: "You are surrounded by the mountains here, by your brother, by your sister, by all your relatives. You will be afflicted by the constant one, by the one who is angry, by the one without interruption, by the one with the root. You are surrounded by the one who praises, by the one praised by the root."
1.14.3	He places the living horn in the uncovered (place).
1.13.15	That is the good, that is the Viraḍ food, that is the food of the gods, that is the nourishing food, that is to be given, that is the good. Having said this, he then says, "Feed the Brahmins."
1.13.16	When they have eaten, he serves them with the leftover food.
1.14.4	If the ministers, pupils, or servants should run away, he should cry after them, "May he who has not come, come! May he who has not grown, grow! Indra is your cry, may he always cry after you. If you think otherwise of me, may the gods come down to you. Indra having bound you with a noose, may he again bring you to me."
1.13.17	May heaven accept it. May earth give it. May earth accept it. May heaven give it. May the breath accept it. May the life accept it. May life eat it. May life drink it.

1.14.5	Then, having entered his own house, having placed a bundle of grass, he offers with the invocation "May the fire be kindled and may it be kindled."
1.14.6	Now, then, the protection of the wife.
1.14.7	Having made a paste of hard, firm, and strong substances, one should apply it to the wife's vagina while she is asleep, saying, "Indra, may your penis be false for others, except for me."
1.14.8	Now, here is the accomplishment of trade.
1.14.9	He offers for the sale of goods.
1.15.1	"O gods, we are selling our goods. The gods who desire wealth, may Soma, Agni, Indra, Brihaspati and Ishana place their radiance in it. Svāhā."

You will be afflicted by the constant one, by the one who is angry, by the one without interruption, by the one with the root. You are surrounded by the one who praises, by the one praised by the root."
1.14.3	He places the living horn in the uncovered (place).
1.15.3	The body of that Raraṭyā, the destroyer of the angry one, may the Brahmacārin gods, the wise ones, control it. That which is in your mouth, the Raraṭa, as if piercing upwards, you strike, like a bowman at the sky, I am stretching your anger, like the heart. The sun and the sky and the earth, O Creator, we are taking your anger to them, like the embryo of the mare. Thus one recites against the angry one.
1.14.4	If the ministers, pupils, or servants should run away, he should cry after them, "May he who has not come, come! May he who has not grown, grow! Indra is your cry, may he always cry after you. If you think otherwise of me, may the gods come down to you. Indra having bound you with a noose, may he again bring you to me."

1.15.5	Having kindled a fire in the inner chamber at night and performed the rites up to the Vyāhṛtis, he offers with grains mixed with ghee, reciting: "May you be without tongue, may you be without tongue. I worship you with oblations. As I speak above, may he speak below. May he speak. Svāhā."
1.14.5	Then, having entered his own house, having placed a bundle of grass, he offers with the invocation "May the fire be kindled and may it be kindled."

1.14.7	Having made a paste of hard, firm, and strong substances, one should apply it to the wife's vagina while she is asleep, saying, "Indra, may your penis be false for others, except for me."
1.14.8	Now, here is the accomplishment of trade.
1.15.6	Then he recites over him: "I have taken your speech from the mouth, from the mind, from the heart, from the limbs, from the limbs. I have taken your speech wherever it is hidden. O Rudra, blue-crested hero, in the act, in the act may this tree be responsive to me, as if struck by lightning. Speak below, speak below, speak below the earth. Like a rock, struck by a rock, hidden by me. That is true, what I say. Speak below, you are mine."
1.14.9	He offers for the sale of goods.
1.15.1	"O gods, we are selling our goods. The gods who desire wealth, may Soma, Agni, Indra, Brihaspati and Ishana place their radiance in it. Svāhā."
1.15.2	Now, here is the pacification of anger.
1.15.7	Hirannyabahu, Subhaga, Jitaaksha, and Alaankara, seated in the midst of the gods, said to me, "Svāhā." Having embraced the assembly, he recites.

1.15.3	The body of that Raraṭyā, the destroyer of the angry one, may the Brahmacārin gods, the wise ones, control it. That which is in your mouth, the Raraṭa, as if piercing upwards, you strike, like a bowman at the sky, I am stretching your anger, like the heart. The sun and the sky and the earth, O Creator, we are taking your anger to them, like the embryo of the mare. Thus one recites against the angry one.
1.16.1	Having seen the moon in the Darśa, having sipped water, holding water, he stands with four verses, "May you grow; your new and new birth is nourished by the Adityas and rays."
1.16.2	He mutters while shaking, "May the Dakṣa-minded ones be in me."
1.16.3	He muttles while throwing a stone, "You are a stone, I am a stone. May there be peace to you. Do not harm me."
1.15.4	Now, then, the recitation of the Abhijana.
1.15.5	Having kindled a fire in the inner chamber at night and performed the rites up to the Vyāhṛtis, he offers with grains mixed with ghee, reciting: "May you be without tongue, may you be without tongue. I worship you with oblations. As I speak above, may he speak below. May he speak. Svāhā."
1.16.4	Having cut off the thread of that (thread), one should destroy it with the breath of the mouth.
1.16.5	Those birds who fall with fear along with the Niṛṛtas, may they be destroyed by the auspicious and shining energy of Śiva. With this, one should recite the mantra. Having removed it from the hand with another (thread), one can wash it with water.
1.16.6	From the sky, from the great heaven, the drop of water has fallen on me for good, with the mind of Indra. I have come with the Brahman, protected by the good deed done. One should recite this if an unknown drop of water falls on him.
1.15.6	Then he recites over him: "I have taken your speech from the mouth, from the mind, from the heart, from the limbs, from the limbs. I have taken your speech wherever it is hidden. O Rudra, blue-crested hero, in the act, in the act may this tree be responsive to me, as if struck by lightning. Speak below, speak below, speak below the earth. Like a rock, struck by a rock, hidden by me. That is true, what I say. Speak below, you are mine."
1.16.7	If a fruit falls from the top of a tree, or if it falls from the sky, then it is the wind. If the tree is weak, and if the water is obstructing, then one should recite the mantra, "May the wind carry away the obstruction." If an unknown fruit falls on him,
1.16.8	One recites the mantra, "Salutations to the wind, to the one who resides in the path, to Rudra, salutations to Rudra who resides in the paths," while stepping onto a crossroads.
1.15.7	Hirannyabahu, Subhaga, Jitaaksha, and Alaankara, seated in the midst of the gods, said to me, "Svāhā." Having embraced the assembly, he recites.

1.16.15	The Sūrya-abhinimṛktam is recited at night.
1.16.16	One should not touch the sacrificial post. If one touches it, one should recite the Durishtā Yajñas. If one touches one, one should say, "This is for you, O Vayu." If two, "These are for you, O Vayus." If many, "These are yours, O Vayus.
1.16.17	Whatever is uncalled for, called for, praised, lamented by birds, and whatever is uttered by the deer with his eyes, may it be a terror to our enemies. He recites this while going on a journey.

1.17.2	Stretching out his thighs, he falls down, and his left eye closes. What is this, I wonder? This is the Śakuni verse.
1.17.3	The golden-winged bird, the messenger of the gods, having circumambulated the village, may Kauśika speak to us for our welfare. Thus to Pingala.

Whatever food is eaten in the evening, that is not available in the morning due to hunger. May it not harm us. For that was not seen during the day. Svāhā to heaven. Thus, having seen an undesirable dream, one offers oblations with sesame mixed with ghee.

1.19.6	He sprinkles her as before, when she has finished eating and is seated together.
1.18.3	"Be ye established, be ye not shaken; do not shake me. May I not be deprived of you." Thus they are established.

1.19.7	Having recited the Vyāhṛtis, he offers: "May Agni, the first of the deities, come here. May he release his offspring from the noose of death.

May the mother live without being deprived of her presence. May she awaken to the joy of her grandson. Svāhâ! May there be no sound of crying in your house at night, except for those who cry for you.

"May the sky protect your back, the wind your thighs, and the Ashvins your breast while you are breastfeeding. May Savitar protect your sons. May Brihaspati protect you from the wearing of garments. May all the gods protect you from the rear. Svāhā!” "May the one who is childless release the death of her grandson, the sin, and the evil. Like a garland from the head, I release the evil against the enemies. Svāhā." "The Brahmana created by the gods, when being performed, I strike with it the pishachas who sit in the womb, the flesh-eating dead ones. I drive them away from the feet. May you live long. May your sons live. Svāhā.”
1.19.8	Having offered this oblation, he places the stone, saying, "Stand on this stone. Be firm like a stone. Crush the wicked ones. Bear the enemies."
1.19.9	Having spread two darbha-blades towards the east and west, with their tips towards the north, beyond the fire, they stand on them, facing each other.
1.19.4	Having kindled the fire, having performed the rites up to the wearing of the garment, he sees the bride being brought in, saying, "This is the auspicious bride. Look at her. Having given her good fortune, go away."
1.19.5	The wife sits to the right of the husband.
1.19.6	He sprinkles her as before, when she has finished eating and is seated together.
1.20.1	Facing east, he should take the hand of one facing west, or vice versa. If one desires to generate a male, one should take the thumb. If one desires a female, one should take all the fingers. If one desires both, one should take both the thumb and the fingers together with the hair. "O Sarasvati, like a horse, like a swift one, like a good one, I have placed you in front of the offspring of all beings. I take your hand for the sake of good offspring, so that I may be with my husband as long as the sun shines. Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitar, Purandhi, may you give me the household fire."
1.19.7	Having recited the Vyāhṛtis, he offers: "May Agni, the first of the deities, come here. May he release his offspring from the noose of death. May this king Varuna consent to this, so that this woman may not weep for her grandson. Svāhā! May this woman be protected by Agni, the domestic fire. May he lead her offspring to a long life. May the mother live without being deprived of her presence. May she awaken to the joy of her grandson. Svāhâ! May there be no sound of crying in your house at night, except for those who cry for you. Do not lie down with your hair loose. May the wife of the living husband rule the world of the husband. May she see her offspring with a joyful mind. Svāhā!" "May the sky protect your back, the wind your thighs, and the Ashvins your breast while you are breastfeeding. May Savitar protect your sons. May Brihaspati protect you from the wearing of garments. May all the gods protect you from the rear. Svāhā!” "May the one who is childless release the death of her grandson, the sin, and the evil. Like a garland from the head, I release the evil against the enemies. Svāhā." "The Brahmana created by the gods, when being performed, I strike with it the pishachas who sit in the womb, the flesh-eating dead ones. I drive them away from the feet. May you live long. May your sons live. Svāhā.”
1.19.8	Having offered this oblation, he places the stone, saying, "Stand on this stone. Be firm like a stone. Crush the wicked ones. Bear the enemies."
1.20.2	She is to be recited, turning towards the west, with the right shoulder in front, with the formula, "May she be the eye of the good, the slayer of the wicked, the auspicious one, the well-willed one, the well shining one, the life-giver, the hero-giver, the gentle one, the giver of good, the giver of peace to the two-footed and the four-footed. May she be the giver of peace. O Pusan, may you make her the most auspicious one, in whom men sow seeds. In whom the well-wishing ones are resting, in whom the well-wishers are striking the sheath. Soma first knew, Gandharva knew the next, Agni knew the third, you are the lord of the fourth, I am born of men. Soma gave to Gandharva, Gandharva gave to Agni, Agni gave me cattle and sons. Now I have taken you. You are heaven, I am earth. You are Sama, I am Rik. You are the two, let us come together and deposit the semen for the son, for the son who knows, for the son, the knower, for the son. For the son who knows. For the son, the one who knows. For wealth, for prosperity, for good offspring, for good strength. This daughter of yours, O Indra, the well-born one, the well favored one, make her the one with ten sons, make her the eleventh husband."
1.19.9	Having spread two darbha-blades towards the east and west, with their tips towards the north, beyond the fire, they stand on them, facing each other.
1.20.3	Having placed her in the proper position, he pours two handfuls of parched grains on her palms anointed with clarified butter, with the verse, "I pour these parched grains for prosperity, for your and my affection. May Agni approve of this."
1.20.4	Having sprinkled, this woman, while reciting the verse, "May my husband live long, may my kinsmen prosper. Svāhā!" offers oblations with her joined palms.
1.20.1	Facing east, he should take the hand of one facing west, or vice versa. If one desires to generate a male, one should take the thumb. If one desires a female, one should take all the fingers.

I take your hand for the sake of good offspring, so that I may be with my husband as long as the sun shines. Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitar, Purandhi, may you give me the household fire."
1.20.5	"With life, with life" (he says) while raising (the fire). "May we, with thy help, cross over all difficulties, like a stream. May we overcome the enemies." Having circumambulated the fire clockwise, he scatters the parched grains in the same way.

1.21.2	Having placed the seventh step, he recites: "You two have become friends for seven steps. May I go to friendship from your friendship. May I not be a woman. May I not become a woman."
1.21.3	Then, stepping on his right foot with his right foot, and rubbing his right shoulder with his right hand, he touches the heart region as before.
1.20.2	She is to be recited, turning towards the west, with the right shoulder in front, with the formula, "May she be the eye of the good, the slayer of the wicked, the auspicious one, the well-willed one, the well shining one, the life-giver, the hero-giver, the gentle one, the giver of good, the giver of peace to the two-footed and the four-footed. May she be the giver of peace. O Pusan, may you make her the most auspicious one, in whom men sow seeds. In whom the well-wishing ones are resting, in whom the well-wishers are striking the sheath. Soma first knew, Gandharva knew the next, Agni knew the third, you are the lord of the fourth, I am born of men. Soma gave to Gandharva, Gandharva gave to Agni, Agni gave me cattle and sons. Now I have taken you. You are heaven, I am earth. You are Sama, I am Rik. You are the two, let us come together and deposit the semen for the son, for the son who knows, for the son, the knower, for the son. For the son who knows. For the son, the one who knows. For wealth, for prosperity, for good offspring, for good strength. This daughter of yours, O Indra, the well-born one, the well favored one, make her the one with ten sons, make her the eleventh husband."

1.21.4	"Thou art the knot of the vital airs; do thou not be loosened." Thus he says while touching the region of the navel.
1.21.5	Having seated her facing the east, beyond the fire, and standing in front of her, he sprinkles her with water with the three verses, "The waters are firm, the bestower of wealth," and with the four verses, "Golden-coloured, pure, shining," and with the Anuvaka, "Pavamana, the bestower."
1.20.4	Having sprinkled, this woman, while reciting the verse, "May my husband live long, may my kinsmen prosper. Svāhā!" offers oblations with her joined palms.
1.21.6	Here seeds are sown.
1.22.1	Then they let it flow or cause it to flow.

1.25.2	Earth, I send forth the hero with Prajapati, the bull. Place him here. Heaven, I send forth with Prajapati the bull. Place here. Space, I send forth him with Prajapati. Place him here." Thus he generates a hero.

1.24.7	For three nights, he performs the vows explained by the Brahmanas while wearing dirty clothes.
1.25.4	And what is at the beginning and what is at the end, says Badarayana.
1.26.1	The marriage ceremony and other rites are called the rites of the domestic fire.
1.26.2	The rites of the domestic rites are performed in that.
1.26.3	By performing the rites of the Domestic Fire, one becomes a householder with the domestic fire, and by offering the Parvan oblation, one becomes a performer of the Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices.
1.26.4	One who has discontinued the twelve-day rite should re-establish it.
1.24.8	On the fourth day, she bathes, wears fresh clothes, adorns herself, and converses with Brahmins. After performing the ritual of sipping water, she invokes the following:
1.26.5	Or he may offer all the oblations after deliberation.
1.26.6	On a well-prepared, well-spread, well-sprinkled, well-pounded ground.
1.26.7	Covering it with the branches of the Udumbara or the branches of the Plaksha tree, and collecting the materials as much as he can, he should kindle the fire from the sacrificial wood, or bring the worldly fire, and having made it hot, he should light it and offer it.
1.26.8	"Om, earth, heaven, heaven, Om, the foundation."
1.26.9	Then, having settled the fire and concluding with the Vyāhṛtis, he offers two Mindahuti offerings: "Whatever was lost from the self, Agni has given back the eye."
1.26.10	He offers three offerings with the string: "Weaving the string, awaken, O Agni, the thirty-three strings."
1.26.11	He offers four oblations with the formula, "O Agni, thou art the one who turns back, O Agni, the son of Angiras, again with energy and wealth."
1.26.12	Each of the Vyahrtis separately and all together.
1.26.13	Having offered, he says, "O Agni, may I be without censure. You are my true friend. I am held by the mind of iron. I offer oblations with iron. Grant us healing. Svāhā." This is the Manasa-svarūpa Sūkta.
1.25.1	May Vishnu fashion the womb, Tvashtri may fashion the forms. May Prajapati sprinkle, may the Creator deposit the embryo in thee. Deposit the embryo, O Sinivali, deposit the embryo, O Sarasvati. The two Ashvins have deposited the embryo, the two wearing garlands of lotuses. The golden kindling-sticks, when the Ashvins churned him, that embryo we invoke for thee, for the tenth-month-old child. As the earth is with Agni as its embryo, as heaven is with Indra as its embryo, and as the wind is with the directions as its embryo, so do I deposit the embryo in you. The embryo which thou didst receive in thy womb, may a male child be born. May the mother bear it for ten months. May it be born as the most heroic of thy sons. May the embryo enter thy womb, a male like an arrow in the target. May a hero be born here as thy son. I make him tenth-month-born. I make him thy son. May the embryo be deposited in thy womb. May it be unborn, full, without blemish, without disease, without sickness, without evil. May the bulls generate for us all the abundant virility. With that be thou pregnant. May it be the most heroic of thine own sons. The embryo which Indra deposited in the womb of Vasha and in the womb of Vehatl, with that be thou pregnant, and be thou a cow that gives milk. The name of the Cakravaka.
1.25.2	Earth, I send forth the hero with Prajapati, the bull. Place him here. Heaven, I send forth with Prajapati the bull. Place here. Space, I send forth him with Prajapati. Place him here." Thus he generates a hero.
1.25.3	All the approaches are to be done with mantras, says Atreya.
1.26.14	Having offered the seven Prajapati oblations, having followed the Dashahotar with the mind, having offered the Grahas, having offered the oblations, having offered the Soma, having offered the Somas, having offered the Prajapati oblation, having offered the seven Prajapatis, having offered the Dashahotara, having followed the mind, having performed the Grahas, one should offer this oblation. "O Varuna, I am coming to you. You are Agni. You are Agni, O Agni, I am coming. O Prajapati, whatever transgression I have committed in this rite." Here some offer the Jaya oblations, the Rajyabhrita oblations, as before.
1.26.15	Having fed the Brahmanas with food, having recited the auspicious benedictory verses, he performs the sacrifice with the well-known Agniya-sthalipaka-offering.
1.26.16	Here he gives a gift to the preceptor, a garment, a cow or a bull.
1.26.17	If he goes away, it is explained that the installation of the fire is done either in oneself or in the two fires.
1.26.18	Or one should install it in the Samidhi.
1.25.4	And what is at the beginning and what is at the end, says Badarayana.
1.26.1	The marriage ceremony and other rites are called the rites of the domestic fire.
1.26.2	The rites of the domestic rites are performed in that.
1.26.3	By performing the rites of the Domestic Fire, one becomes a householder with the domestic fire, and by offering the Parvan oblation, one becomes a performer of the Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices.
1.26.4	One who has discontinued the twelve-day rite should re-establish it.

1.26.16	Here he gives a gift to the preceptor, a garment, a cow or a bull.
1.26.17	If he goes away, it is explained that the installation of the fire is done either in oneself or in the two fires.
1.26.18	Or one should install it in the Samidhi.
1.27.8	May not our enemy be a refuge. The god, measured by the gods, at the beginning of his life, wearing grass, you are well-disposed. Be auspicious to the bipeds and the quadrupeds. He touches the hidden (fire) with this (verse).

2.2.7	If the embryo is discharged, she should rub it three times upwards of the navel with her moist hand, saying, "Thou art turned away, not turned towards. May Tvashtri bind thee in the bond. Having placed thee in the seasons, may the ten months be without loss."
2.2.8	At the time of delivery, she should quickly deliver the child, placing a pot of water on the head and playing a musical instrument. Then she should touch the woman's belly.
2.3.1	Just as the wind blows, just as the ocean surges, so may your embryo surge, may it move with the placenta. This is the silent rubbing.
2.3.2	Having placed the axe on the stone, he places the gold above it, and the boy above the two, saying, "Be thou a stone, be thou an axe, be the gold spread out. Thou art named after thy son, live thou a hundred autumns. Thou art born from limb to limb, thou art born from the heart. Thou art named according to thy self, live thou a full hundred autumns."
2.1.3	This is my truth, O Varuna. You are Agni. You are Agni, O Agni. You have come, O Agni, lord of creatures.

"He says, "May they be killed, may they be bound." This is Brahma's messenger. Agni surrounded them, Indra surrounded them, Brihaspati surrounded them, I know them, the Brahman knows them. May the ones with broken teeth, the ones with loose hair, the ones with hanging breasts, svāhā." The ones who move at night, the ones who rule the thighs, the ones with spears in their hands, the ones who drink from skulls, svāhā"." "The one who is the mother of these, the one who is the father, the one who has high-pitched ears, the one who goes to the mother, the one who wants to go to the village, svāhā "The sister who moves at night, the one who looks at the family through the joints, the one who stays awake when her husband is sleeping, the one for whom the mind is attached, svāhā To those, you are the one who goes on the dark path, the one who causes grief, the one with compassion, the one with sorrow, the one with anger, the one with fear, the one with grief, the one who makes the heart grieve, the one who burns the organs of Agni, svāhā!" He throws them into the embers, repeating this mantra for each one."
2.3.2	Having placed the axe on the stone, he places the gold above it, and the boy above the two, saying, "Be thou a stone, be thou an axe, be the gold spread out. Thou art named after thy son, live thou a hundred autumns. Thou art born from limb to limb, thou art born from the heart. Thou art named according to thy self, live thou a full hundred autumns."
2.3.3	If another does not fall, then one should sprinkle water on the head of the deceased with folded hands, saying, "O Tildeva, do not fall into the fire, do not fall onto the blade. Do not fall from your own path."

2.3.10	Then he bathes him with warm and cold water: "I release thee from the curse, from the curse of Niriti, from the noose of Varuna. I make thee free from sin for the Brahman. May the two heaven and earth be auspicious to thee. May Agni be auspicious to thee with the waters. May heaven and earth be propitious with the plants. May the atmosphere be propitious with wind. May the four directions be propitious to thee. The sun has released the dead from darkness, when the gods released them from sin. Thus I release this one from the curse of the dead, from the curse, the noose of Yama."
2.3.11	Then he places him on the lap of his mother.
2.4.1	"The four quarters of the sky, the wives of the wind, which the sun looks upon, of them I place thee in the old age. Let the disease go away to the evil spirit."
2.4.2	Having placed him, he recites: "May Rakshas not harm thy son. May the cow not be too loose. May it be dear to the wealth, increasing in its own power."
2.4.3	Having washed the right breast, he makes it suckle, saying, "May this boy suckle old age, may he live through all his life. Having reached the breast, may he have long life, fame, lustre, glory and strength."
2.4.4	The same for the left breast.
2.4.5	When we say, "Bend down," or "Touch here," he bends down and touches both places. Then she places a pitcher of water over his head, saying, "The waters are awake in the house, as the gods are awake, so may this good mother be awake."
2.4.6	On the twelfth day, the mother and son take a bath.
2.4.7	They make a clean room.
2.4.8	They carry away the fire of childbirth. They carry away the domestic fire.
2.4.9	Having placed that fire, and having performed the Vyāhṛtis, he offers twelve oblations with the verse, "May Dhātā grant us wealth." Some offer thirteen oblations.
2.3.7	Then he fumigates him with mustard seeds mixed with ashes: "May Śaṇḍa, Mārka, Upavīra, Śāṇḍīkera, Ulūkha, and Cyavana perish from here, svāhā. May the one who writes, the one who erases, the one who does not blink, the one who speaks, the one who listens, svāhā, the pot of Aryaman, the enemy, the one with a vessel in hand, the skillful one, svāhā."

"He says, "May they be killed, may they be bound." This is Brahma's messenger. Agni surrounded them, Indra surrounded them, Brihaspati surrounded them, I know them, the Brahman knows them. May the ones with broken teeth, the ones with loose hair, the ones with hanging breasts, svāhā." The ones who move at night, the ones who rule the thighs, the ones with spears in their hands, the ones who drink from skulls, svāhā"." "The one who is the mother of these, the one who is the father, the one who has high-pitched ears, the one who goes to the mother, the one who wants to go to the village, svāhā "The sister who moves at night, the one who looks at the family through the joints, the one who stays awake when her husband is sleeping, the one for whom the mind is attached, svāhā To those, you are the one who goes on the dark path, the one who causes grief, the one with compassion, the one with sorrow, the one with anger, the one with fear, the one with grief, the one who makes the heart grieve, the one who burns the organs of Agni, svāhā!" He throws them into the embers, repeating this mantra for each one."
2.3.8	Then having washed his hands, he touches the ground with the formula, "Thy heart is well-settled in heaven and in the moon. Grant me immortality. May I not weep for my grandson." "I know thy heart is well-established in heaven and in moon. The lord of immortality, may I not weep for grandson."
2.4.10	This is my truth, O Varuna. You are our Agni. You are our Indra. You are our Yama. You are our Varuna. You have come, O Agni. You are Agni. You are Prajapati. Whatever transgression I have committed in this rite, Here some perform the Jayā Ātmanānas and the Rāṣṭrabṛt offerings as before. Having fed the Brahmins with food, having recited the auspicious benediction, the Svāsthyanam, and the Rddhi, one should give the son a name with two or four syllables, beginning with a sound, ending with a vowel, with long vowels, and ending with a vowel. Where there is an upasargas, it is known to be established.
2.3.9	Then, for the generation of intelligence, having bound a golden object with Darbha grass and concealed it, he makes the boy facing east hold it and makes him eat ghee, reciting, "I offer the Rg verses to you, svāhā. I offer the Yajus hymns to you, svāhâ. I offer the Sama chants to you, svähâ. I offer to you the Rg, Yajus, and Sama chants of the Atharva and Angirasas, svähâ."
2.4.11	The father and mother should first address each other as "father" and "mother." And it is known that my name was first known as "Jātavedas."
2.4.12	One should have two names. It is known that a brahmin who knows both names is half-learned.
2.4.13	The second name should be a constellation name, and the other should be a secret name.
2.4.14	One should address him with either of the two.
2.4.15	It is understood that one should give the third name.
2.4.16	One touches the son who has returned from exile with the words, "I touch you with the brilliance of Soma, with the brilliance of Agni, with the splendor of Surya."
2.4.17	One touches the head with the words, “I smell you with the sound ‘hum’ for the sake of animals, for life and splendor, hum.”
2.3.10	Then he bathes him with warm and cold water: "I release thee from the curse, from the curse of Niriti, from the noose of Varuna. I make thee free from sin for the Brahman. May the two heaven and earth be auspicious to thee. May Agni be auspicious to thee with the waters. May heaven and earth be propitious with the plants. May the atmosphere be propitious with wind. May the four directions be propitious to thee. The sun has released the dead from darkness, when the gods released them from sin. Thus I release this one from the curse of the dead, from the curse, the noose of Yama."
2.4.18	Then with his right hand he takes the right hand of the child, with the thumb, five times with the formula, "Agni is long-lived."
2.4.19	He mutters the formula, "May thy life be established on all sides," at the right ear, as before.
2.5.1	Then in the sixth month, the child is fed with food.

I restore that to you. May the fathers be without injury, may they be born again with all their limbs. Obeisance to their share of the oblations. O all-knowing Agni, carry the oblation to the fathers, where you know them to be deposited in the yonder world. May the ladle-bearers pour the oblation for them.

Thou art imperishable. Thou art the best of the Pitrs. Here and in the other world, the earth is the common (place). Agni is the observer of the gift for non-negligence. The earth is thy vessel... I offer thee in thine in-breath and out-breath... Thou art imperishable... Thou art the best among the grandfathers. Here and in other world, the sky is the common ( place).

This is thy father, O Sarasvati, as great as Vayu and the atmosphere, so great is thy measure, so great thy greatness. I give thee as a being. As Vayu is imperishable and decayless, so may he he imperishable and decay less for my grandfather. May he be decayless for thee.

2.15.5	Having made her lie down, he silently nourishes her with water, and silently takes out the omentum, the heart and the fat.
2.13.1	This is thy sweet flowing stream, O Sarasvati. As great as Agni and the earth, so great is his measure, so great is its greatness. I give him to thee as a being, as Agni is imperishable and without decay, so may he be imperishable and without decav for my father. May he be imperishable for thee. This is thy father, O Sarasvati, as great as Vayu and the atmosphere, so great is thy measure, so great thy greatness. I give thee as a being.

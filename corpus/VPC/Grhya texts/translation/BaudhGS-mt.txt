I am like the wind, like the sun, like the moon, like the lightning, like the water, like the fire, like the earth, like the sky, like the ocean, like the wind, I am like the sun, I am like Indra, I am like Yama, I am like Varuna, I am like Vayu, I am like Agni, I am like Soma, I am like Kubera, I am like Prajapati, I am like Brahma, I am like Vishnu, I am like Rudra, I am like Ishvara, I am like Shiva, I am like Shankara, I am like Sadashiva, I am like Ananta, I am like Vasudeva, I am the supreme Brahman, I am the highest Brahman, I am like a tree, like a mountain, like a river, like a cloud, like a serpent, like a lion, like a tiger, like a deer, like a bird, like a fish, like a tortoise, like a frog, like a bee, like a mosquito, like a
2.5.16	Then he makes him recite the following verse while releasing the black antelope skin: "The black antelope skin is for the Brahmin, the Ruru antelope skin for the Kshatriya, the goat skin for the Vaishya, or the black antelope skin for all. The eye of a friend, the most powerful, the glorious, the aged, the blazing, the unassailable, the aging, the covering, the skin of the horse, I have put on."
2.5.26	Then he takes him in his right hand, saying, "In whom all beings, past and future, are concentrated, with that I take thee; I take thee for myself. I take thee for me with Prajapati."
2.5.27	Then he gives him over to the deities: "I give you over to the gods, I give you over to all the gods, I hand you over to all gods, I give over all of you to all gods, to all deities I give you over."
2.5.28	Then he takes it up with the formula, "In the impulse of god Savitr, with the arms of Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, I take thee up."
2.5.29	Then the youth offers from the cooked (rice). "The bull of the metres, of universal form, has arisen from the metres, from immortality. May Indra, with his wisdom, unite me with immortality. May I be a receptacle of the divine. Svāhā."
2.5.30	Then he offers oblations of ghee with the six verses without metre: "For Kṣetri, for Nirṛti,"
2.5.20	"Ojas (vitality) is yours, bestow vitality on me." This is the fig tree.
2.5.21	"Bala (strength) is yours, bestows strength on me." This belongs to the Rauhitika tree.
2.5.22	"Pusti (nourishment) is yours, bestowed nourishment on me." This pertains to the Badara tree.
2.5.23	"Urdh (energy) is yours, energy on me." This refers to the Udumbara tree.
2.5.31	Having thus offered oblations with the Brahma-sūkta, he offers with the six verses beginning with "Brahma, the born."
2.5.32	From the Svishtakrit onwards, it is accomplished up to the offering of the gift of a cow.
2.5.33	He places the remnants of the oblations on Palāśa leaves in front of the fire, saying, "Salutations to the blue-throated one."
2.5.34	Here is the Savitra Vrata.
2.5.35-36	Then he makes the four Palāśa-sticks, moist, with leaves, and with sprouts, of the size of a span, with their tips not dried up, anointed with ghee, and makes them recite the following verse: "Of the trees used in sacrifices, I shall perform the Savitrī vow, may I be able to do it, svāhā."
2.5.24-25	I am like the shadow of a tree, like the fame of a mountain. I am like the wind, like the sun, like the moon, like the lightning, like the water, like the fire, like the earth, like the sky, like the ocean, like the wind, I am like the sun, I am like Indra, I am like Yama, I am like Varuna, I am like Vayu, I am like Agni, I am like Soma, I am like Kubera, I am like Prajapati, I am like Brahma, I am like Vishnu, I am like Rudra, I am like Ishvara, I am like Shiva, I am like Shankara, I am like Sadashiva, I am like Ananta, I am like Vasudeva, I am the supreme Brahman, I am the highest Brahman, I am like a tree, like a mountain, like a river, like a cloud, like a serpent, like a lion, like a tiger, like a deer, like a bird, like a fish, like a tortoise, like a frog, like a bee, like a mosquito, like a
2.5.37	"O Vayu, O Vrata-lord, O Aditya, O Vrata lord, O lord of vows, I shall observe the vow of Savitri. May I be able to do it. Svāhā."
2.5.38	Placing a stool with its tip towards the north behind the fire, the teacher sits facing east on it, saying, "May the National Bearer be your teacher. May your wife not be your teacher."
2.5.26	Then he takes him in his right hand, saying, "In whom all beings, past and future, are concentrated, with that I take thee; I take thee for myself. I take thee for me with Prajapati."
2.5.39	In front of him, the young boy sits facing away from the darbha grass, with his feet touching the feet of the teacher, and says, "Recite the Savitri mantra, please."
2.5.27	Then he gives him over to the deities: "I give you over to the gods, I give you over to all the gods, I hand you over to all gods, I give over all of you to all gods, to all deities I give you over."
2.5.40	Therefore, one should understand that it is Anvāhuḥ. "Then, in the second half, he recites the verse "This is the supreme boon of Savitr" in the form of Vyāhṛtis, either at the beginning or end of each foot, or at the end of each half-verse. Then, he recites all the Vyāhṛtis together."
2.5.28	Then he takes it up with the formula, "In the impulse of god Savitr, with the arms of Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, I take thee up."
2.5.41	Then the boy eats, beginning with the ripe (fruits), saying, "May my body be strong, may my tongue be the sweetest, may I hear much through my ears, thou art the treasure of Brahman, covered with wisdom, protect my learning."
2.5.42	Some, however, eat before the Savitri, saying, "Brahman is food."
2.5.29	Then the youth offers from the cooked (rice). "The bull of the metres, of universal form, has arisen from the metres, from immortality. May Indra, with his wisdom, unite me with immortality. May I be a receptacle of the divine. Svāhā."
2.5.30	Then he offers oblations of ghee with the six verses without metre: "For Kṣetri, for Nirṛti,"
2.5.43	He should not do so. One should not eat without reciting the Savitri verse. One should not recite the Savitri verse without reciting it. This is the opinion of Satyayana.
2.5.44	Then, having touched water, one stands facing the sun with the Jyotishmati verse, "I have overcome darkness."
2.5.31	Having thus offered oblations with the Brahma-sūkta, he offers with the six verses beginning with "Brahma, the born."
2.5.32	From the Svishtakrit onwards, it is accomplished up to the offering of the gift of a cow.
2.5.33	He places the remnants of the oblations on Palāśa leaves in front of the fire, saying, "Salutations to the blue-throated one."
2.5.34	Here is the Savitra Vrata.
2.5.45	Then the preceptor instructs him: "O Brahmachari, perform the rites of purification, do not sleep during the day, collect kindling wood, observe the rules of mendicancy, bring kindling wood from the forest, bring a pot of water, be under the control of the preceptor, study the Vedas."
2.5.46	He performs all this accordingly.
2.5.47	Then, while giving him an empty vessel, he says: "First beg from your mother."
2.5.35-36	Then he makes the four Palāśa-sticks, moist, with leaves, and with sprouts, of the size of a span, with their tips not dried up, anointed with ghee, and makes them recite the following verse: "Of the trees used in sacrifices, I shall perform the Savitrī vow, may I be able to do it, svāhā."
2.5.48	He should first beg from his mother.
2.5.49	A brahmin should beg, saying, "Give me alms."
2.5.50	A kshatriya should say, "Give me some alms."
2.5.51	A vaishya should say, "Please give me some alms." Here is the corrected and aligned text:
2.5.52	Having collected it, he says to the teacher, "This is alms."
2.5.53	The other one accepts it, saying, "This is good alms."
2.5.37	"O Vayu, O Vrata-lord, O Aditya, O Vrata lord, O lord of vows, I shall observe the vow of Savitri. May I be able to do it. Svāhā."
2.5.38	Placing a stool with its tip towards the north behind the fire, the teacher sits facing east on it, saying, "May the National Bearer be your teacher. May your wife not be your teacher."
2.5.54	Having made two effigies of women to the north of the fire, adorned them with perfumes and garlands, worshipped the Brahmins with Trivrit food, recited the benedictions, and said, "May they be pleased with faith and sacrifice."
2.5.55	They maintain this fire for three days, avoiding salt and alkaline substances, and sleeping on the ground.
2.5.39	In front of him, the young boy sits facing away from the darbha grass, with his feet touching the feet of the teacher, and says, "Recite the Savitri mantra, please."
2.5.56	In this very fire, one should offer the kindling woods in the evening and morning with the Vyāhṛtis.
2.5.57	In this way, in any other fire also, always.
2.5.58	Then he circumambulates the fire clockwise. "He says, "Accept our kindling wood, O Agni, today. May the smoke carry the great offering. Touch the divine (fire). The sun has spread its rays with its own rays."
2.5.40	Therefore, one should understand that it is Anvāhuḥ. "Then, in the second half, he recites the verse "This is the supreme boon of Savitr" in the form of Vyāhṛtis, either at the beginning or end of each foot, or at the end of each half-verse. Then, he recites all the Vyāhṛtis together."
2.5.41	Then the boy eats, beginning with the ripe (fruits), saying, "May my body be strong, may my tongue be the sweetest, may I hear much through my ears, thou art the treasure of Brahman, covered with wisdom, protect my learning."
2.5.42	Some, however, eat before the Savitri, saying, "Brahman is food."
2.5.59	Then he sprinkles the fire, turning to the right, with the formula, "O Aditi, do thou be pleased." To the right, towards the east, with the formula "O Anumati, do thou be please." Towards the west, towards the north, with the formula,"O Sarasvati, do thou be pleaded." Towards the north, towards the east with the formula, "O god Savitr, do thou prosper." All round, turning to the left, silently.
2.5.43	He should not do so. One should not eat without reciting the Savitri verse. One should not recite the Savitri verse without reciting it. This is the opinion of Satyayana.
2.5.44	Then, having touched water, one stands facing the sun with the Jyotishmati verse, "I have overcome darkness."
2.5.60	In that (fire) he places the kindling-sticks in the evening and morning with the Vyāhṛtis, saying, "Bhūḥ svāhā, Bhuvaḥ svāhā. Suvaḥ svāha. Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Suvaḥ svāhā."
2.5.61	Having collected it thus and sprinkled it thus, he joins the mantras ending with "Anvamasthāḥ prasāvīḥ."
2.5.45	Then the preceptor instructs him: "O Brahmachari, perform the rites of purification, do not sleep during the day, collect kindling wood, observe the rules of mendicancy, bring kindling wood from the forest, bring a pot of water, be under the control of the preceptor, study the Vedas."
2.5.46	He performs all this accordingly.
2.5.47	Then, while giving him an empty vessel, he says: "First beg from your mother."
2.5.62	Then he approaches him with the three verses, "That splendour of thine, O Agni," etc., and with the three verses beginning with "May I have wisdom in me, may I have progeny in me." The man is constituted of six parts, as is known from this Brāhmaṇa.
2.5.63	Then, when the three dawns have appeared, taking this Agni, they go to that direction where the Palāśa tree becomes visible.
2.5.48	He should first beg from his mother.
2.5.49	A brahmin should beg, saying, "Give me alms."
2.5.50	A kshatriya should say, "Give me some alms."
2.5.51	A vaishya should say, "Please give me some alms." Here is the corrected and aligned text:
2.5.52	Having collected it, he says to the teacher, "This is alms."
2.5.53	The other one accepts it, saying, "This is good alms."
2.5.64	He circumambulates him, saying, "May I be as you are, O Suśravā, the guardian of the treasure of the gods. May I be as you, O Suśrava, the guardian of Brahman's treasure of the Brahmanas."
2.5.65	Having placed the fire in front of him, having spread it out, he offers the expiation for the violation of the vow with the two verses, "Whatever was my fault, Agni has given me back my sight."
2.5.54	Having made two effigies of women to the north of the fire, adorned them with perfumes and garlands, worshipped the Brahmins with Trivrit food, recited the benedictions, and said, "May they be pleased with faith and sacrifice."
2.5.55	They maintain this fire for three days, avoiding salt and alkaline substances, and sleeping on the ground.
2.5.56	In this very fire, one should offer the kindling woods in the evening and morning with the Vyāhṛtis.
2.5.57	In this way, in any other fire also, always.
2.5.66	Then he makes the four Palāśa-sticks, moist, with leaves, and with sprouts, of the size of a span, with their tips not dried up, anointed with ghee, and makes them recite the following verse: "Of the trees used in sacrifices, this is one."
2.5.67	"O Agni, lord of vows, I have observed the vow of Savitr. I was not able to do it. May it be accomplished for me. Svāhā."
2.5.58	Then he circumambulates the fire clockwise. "He says, "Accept our kindling wood, O Agni, today. May the smoke carry the great offering. Touch the divine (fire). The sun has spread its rays with its own rays."
2.5.68	"O Vayu, the lord of vows, O Aditya, the lord of the vows, O lord of vows, I have observed the vow of Savitri. I was not able to do it. May it be accomplished. Svāhā."
2.5.69	Having worshipped Sushrava in the same way, having honoured the Brahmins with food consisting of three parts, and having recited the blessings,
2.5.70	Here some people give away the staff, antelope skin, girdle, and garment.
2.5.59	Then he sprinkles the fire, turning to the right, with the formula, "O Aditi, do thou be pleased." To the right, towards the east, with the formula "O Anumati, do thou be please." Towards the west, towards the north, with the formula,"O Sarasvati, do thou be pleaded." Towards the north, towards the east with the formula, "O god Savitr, do thou prosper." All round, turning to the left, silently.
2.5.71	Taking others, he takes his own. We take away your first-born. May all the gods be pleased with you. May your brothers, your friends, many of them, be pleased with you, the well-born one.
2.5.60	In that (fire) he places the kindling-sticks in the evening and morning with the Vyāhṛtis, saying, "Bhūḥ svāhā, Bhuvaḥ svāhā. Suvaḥ svāha. Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Suvaḥ svāhā."
2.5.61	Having collected it thus and sprinkled it thus, he joins the mantras ending with "Anvamasthāḥ prasāvīḥ."
2.5.72	Then, covering the lower part of the body up to the knees, carrying a staff, a deer-skin, and a girdle, avoiding food at the time of śrāddha, during pregnancy, at sexual intercourse, and at the time of drinking wine and eating meat, eating alms, sleeping on the ground, and going to the house of the teacher, it is known that the teacher is Brahman.
2.6.1	Having studied the Vedas, one should bathe. This is said to be the return from study.
2.5.62	Then he approaches him with the three verses, "That splendour of thine, O Agni," etc., and with the three verses beginning with "May I have wisdom in me, may I have progeny in me." The man is constituted of six parts, as is known from this Brāhmaṇa.
2.5.63	Then, when the three dawns have appeared, taking this Agni, they go to that direction where the Palāśa tree becomes visible.
2.6.2	The Veda is called the Mantras and the Brahmanas.
2.6.3	The Mantras and the Brāhmanas are called the Veda.
2.6.4	The Mantric and Brāhmanic texts are the authority for the sacrifice.
2.6.5	Having studied the Mantric and Brāhmaniac texts, and having observed the prescribed vows,
2.6.6	This much is different.
2.6.7	Then, having drawn the image of the gods and so on, having anointed a Palāśa twig with ghee, he offers it at midday.
2.6.8	That has been explained before.
2.5.64	He circumambulates him, saying, "May I be as you are, O Suśravā, the guardian of the treasure of the gods. May I be as you, O Suśrava, the guardian of Brahman's treasure of the Brahmanas."
2.5.65	Having placed the fire in front of him, having spread it out, he offers the expiation for the violation of the vow with the two verses, "Whatever was my fault, Agni has given me back my sight."
2.6.9	Then, having shaved off the hair, beard, body-hair and nails, he proceeds with the taking of the umbrella. Having performed the rites up to the taking of the cooked food, he offers the oblation: "Carrying, spreading, making the garment for oneself, my garments, cows, and food and drink always, then bring me prosperity along with the hairy animals and cattle, svāhā."
2.5.66	Then he makes the four Palāśa-sticks, moist, with leaves, and with sprouts, of the size of a span, with their tips not dried up, anointed with ghee, and makes them recite the following verse: "Of the trees used in sacrifices, this is one."
2.5.67	"O Agni, lord of vows, I have observed the vow of Savitr. I was not able to do it. May it be accomplished for me. Svāhā."
2.6.10	Then he offers the oblations of ghee, saying, "May the students come to me, svāhā! May I have fame among the people, svāhā!" "May I be better than my enemies, svāhā." "May I enter you, O Bhaga, svāhā. May Bhaga enter me, svāyāhā."
2.6.11	From the Svishtakrit onwards, it is accomplished up to the giving of the cow as a gift.
2.5.68	"O Vayu, the lord of vows, O Aditya, the lord of the vows, O lord of vows, I have observed the vow of Savitri. I was not able to do it. May it be accomplished. Svāhā."
2.5.69	Having worshipped Sushrava in the same way, having honoured the Brahmins with food consisting of three parts, and having recited the blessings,
2.5.70	Here some people give away the staff, antelope skin, girdle, and garment.
2.6.12	Then he places the remnant of the oblation on a Bilva branch in front of the fire, saying, "In thee, O thousand-branched one, I cleanse myself, O Bhaga, svāhā."
2.6.13	Then he eats from the cooked food, beginning with the ripe, saying, "As waters flow in channels, as months pass by day after day, so may the Brahmachārins come to me from all sides, svāhā.
2.5.71	Taking others, he takes his own. We take away your first-born. May all the gods be pleased with you. May your brothers, your friends, many of them, be pleased with you, the well-born one.
2.6.14	Having eaten and sipped water, he touches his chest with the formula, "I touch myself, you are the protector, protect me, approach me."
2.6.15	He stays there till the rising of the stars.
2.6.16	When the stars have risen, having come out, he stands towards the directions. This much is settled from here onwards.
2.5.72	Then, covering the lower part of the body up to the knees, carrying a staff, a deer-skin, and a girdle, avoiding food at the time of śrāddha, during pregnancy, at sexual intercourse, and at the time of drinking wine and eating meat, eating alms, sleeping on the ground, and going to the house of the teacher, it is known that the teacher is Brahman.

2.11.8	Then he sprinkles her with water, saying, "For the Fathers thee, for the Grandfathers thee, for the Great-Grandfathers thee, I sprinkle thee, the beloved." Some say, "Silently."
2.11.9	They make her lie down here, with her head towards the west, and her feet towards the south.
2.11.10	When she is made to lie down, he sprinkles her with the water.
2.11.11	He makes her breathe silently.
2.10.3	Then, having offered oblations to Shukra and Shuchi at the beginning of summer, and having adorned oneself with summer ornaments, and having given summer food to Brahmins, one eats the remaining food along with the assembly.
2.11.12	Having silently taken out the omentum, he takes out the heart.
2.11.13	The omentum and the heart are known.
2.11.14	Having placed them on these stakes, they cook them in that very fire.
2.10.4	Then, having offered the oblations to Nabhas and Nabasyas at the beginning of the rainy season, and having adorned himself with the ornaments of the rainy season and given food to the Brahmins, he eats the remaining food along with his retinue.
2.11.15	The meat, rice, cakes and other eatables are cooked separately. When all this is ready, he invites the Brahmanas, who have washed their hands and feet, and have sipped water. He makes them sit on seats covered with Darbha grass, two in the case of the gods and three in the case of ancestors, or one in each case, facing the east or the north.

2.11.17	Having offered water to them, he makes them grasp it for a moment with the Pranava.
2.11.18	"The moment is performed at the eight-day śrāddha." "The reply is "Om, so be it."
2.11.19	"May you obtain, may you obtain."

2.11.21	Then he makes them accept water mixed with sesamum, saying, "To him be svadhā, salutations! To him be svadhã, salutations!"
2.11.22	Some prescribe the offering of water mixed with sesaum three times, saying that one should offer water mixed with sesanum twice in front of the food and the third time after the food has been eaten.
2.10.8	Then, having offered to the Adhimasas and to Anhaspati, he adorns himself with the ornaments of the month of Chaitra, gives food to Brahmins, and eats the remaining food with his followers.
2.10.9	This is either the Agnihotra or the Apūrvika.
2.10.10	The descent has been explained.
2.11.23	Then, having worshipped them with clothes, perfumes, flowers, incense, lamps, and garlands, according to one's means, he asks them, "May the fire be kindled and the rites performed?" The others reply, "Let it be done."
2.11.24	Or he says, "I shall perform the rites in the fire," and the others reply, "Do it."
2.11.1	Now the Aṣṭaka-homa.
2.11.2	It should be performed on the eighth day of the dark fortnight of that month.
2.11.3	If it is postponed, it should be done in the same way in Māgha and Phālguna.
2.11.4	If all are together, it should be performed on any of the seventh, eighth or ninth days of the dark fortnight after Māgha Pūrṇimā, or it may be performed on the ninth day alone.
2.11.25	Then, having been permitted, having performed the rites beginning with the wearing of the sacred thread, having offered five oblations in the melted fat at the mouth of the fire, he offers the oblations: "The waters that flow from the east and the north, the sustainers of the entire world, have placed the son in the womb of the father. Svāhā to Svāhā!"
2.11.5	Some say that one should invite Brahmins who are related to him by birth, family, learning and conduct.
2.11.6	Some say that one should also invite those who are related to one by birth, family and conduct, because the offerings are made to those who are related by birth, family or conduct.
2.11.26	He hid himself from the grandfather by means of the mountains, the interior of the earth, the day, the infinite directions, and the powers. Svāhā! Salutations!
2.11.27	He hid himself from the great-grandfather by means of all the seasons, the day and night with their junctions, the half-months and months. Svāhā!
2.11.7	Having, on the next day, duly worshipped them with shaving, anointing and bathing, and having himself bathed, he takes up the cow in a clean and even place, having drawn the lines for the worship of the gods, etc., and having brought the sacrificial grass, saying, "For your fathers, for your grandfathers, for your great-grandfathers, I offer this cow that is agreeable to you." Some say silently.
2.11.28	Whatever my mother has stolen, not following me, may my father destroy that semen. May it not fall on another. Svāhā to Svāhā!
2.11.29	Whatever I have burned of your flesh, O devourer of the dead, leading you to the worlds, O Jātavedas, I now restore that to you. May you all be born again with all your limbs, O Fathers. Svāhā! Svāhā! To Svāhā!
2.11.8	Then he sprinkles her with water, saying, "For the Fathers thee, for the Grandfathers thee, for the Great-Grandfathers thee, I sprinkle thee, the beloved." Some say, "Silently."
2.11.9	They make her lie down here, with her head towards the west, and her feet towards the south.
2.11.10	When she is made to lie down, he sprinkles her with the water.
2.11.11	He makes her breathe silently.
2.11.30	Having divided the oblation into three parts, he offers with the Udumbara ladle, saying, "We offer the oblation to Soma, the fatherly, the shining, the oblation to the shining one. Accept the oblation, O Soma, the father, the shining one. The oblation is yours. The oblation belongs to the gods and the fathers. Obeisance to the fathers. Svāhā!"
2.11.12	Having silently taken out the omentum, he takes out the heart.
2.11.13	The omentum and the heart are known.
2.11.14	Having placed them on these stakes, they cook them in that very fire.
2.11.15	The meat, rice, cakes and other eatables are cooked separately. When all this is ready, he invites the Brahmanas, who have washed their hands and feet, and have sipped water. He makes them sit on seats covered with Darbha grass, two in the case of the gods and three in the case of ancestors, or one in each case, facing the east or the north.
2.11.33	Then he offers the Aṣṭaka-homa: "This is the one that first fell down." "The fifteen who saw the earlier one." "The image of the year." "These are the seventeen."
2.11.16	If they face east, the disposal is to the south; if they face north, the disposal is east.
2.11.17	Having offered water to them, he makes them grasp it for a moment with the Pranava.
2.11.18	"The moment is performed at the eight-day śrāddha." "The reply is "Om, so be it."
2.11.19	"May you obtain, may you obtain."
2.11.20	The others reply, "You have obtained, you have obtained."
2.11.21	Then he makes them accept water mixed with sesamum, saying, "To him be svadhā, salutations! To him be svadhã, salutations!"
2.11.22	Some prescribe the offering of water mixed with sesaum three times, saying that one should offer water mixed with sesanum twice in front of the food and the third time after the food has been eaten.
2.11.23	Then, having worshipped them with clothes, perfumes, flowers, incense, lamps, and garlands, according to one's means, he asks them, "May the fire be kindled and the rites performed?" The others reply, "Let it be done."
2.11.24	Or he says, "I shall perform the rites in the fire," and the others reply, "Do it."
2.11.25	Then, having been permitted, having performed the rites beginning with the wearing of the sacred thread, having offered five oblations in the melted fat at the mouth of the fire, he offers the oblations: "The waters that flow from the east and the north, the sustainers of the entire world, have placed the son in the womb of the father. Svāhā to Svāhā!"
2.11.34	Then having cut the cake into eight pieces, having offered three portions according to the procedure of the Vapa, and having given the remaining ones to the Brahmanas, having covered these portions with the Idasu, having mixed the rice, meat and soup with ghee, he offers the Upghāta in the southern half with the ladle made of Udumbara wood, saying, "To the Pitrs, Svāhā! To the Pitamahās, Svāhā!" "To the Prapitamahās, Svāhà! To the mothers, Svāhā!” “To the Pitamahīs, Svāhā !” “To the Prapitamahis, Svāhā ! To the maternal grandfathers, Svāhā !" "To the maternal great-grandfathers, Svāha ! To the maternal great-great-grandfathers, Svaha !

To all, Svāhā" !” “To all, Svāha !”
2.11.35	To Agni, the carrier of oblations, the performer of the last rites, Svāhā! Oṃ! In the southeast corner.
2.11.26	He hid himself from the grandfather by means of the mountains, the interior of the earth, the day, the infinite directions, and the powers. Svāhā! Salutations!
2.11.27	He hid himself from the great-grandfather by means of all the seasons, the day and night with their junctions, the half-months and months. Svāhā!
2.11.28	Whatever my mother has stolen, not following me, may my father destroy that semen. May it not fall on another. Svāhā to Svāhā!
2.11.29	Whatever I have burned of your flesh, O devourer of the dead, leading you to the worlds, O Jātavedas, I now restore that to you. May you all be born again with all your limbs, O Fathers. Svāhā! Svāhā! To Svāhā!
2.11.36	Having taken up the rice-gruel in the vessels, having placed the special offerings, having mixed it with the remnants of the oblation, having placed it on the Darbha grass with the tips towards the south, having covered it with Darbha grass with their tips towards the south and having touched it, he says, "Your vessel is earth, your cover is heaven. I offer you in the mouth of Brahma. I offer you to the Brahmanas who know the Vedas. I offer you into the life and out-breath. You are inexhaustible. You are the father of the fathers, the grandfather of the grandfathers, the great-grandfather of the great-grandfathers. You are the best in this world and the other world."
2.11.30	Having divided the oblation into three parts, he offers with the Udumbara ladle, saying, "We offer the oblation to Soma, the fatherly, the shining, the oblation to the shining one. Accept the oblation, O Soma, the father, the shining one. The oblation is yours. The oblation belongs to the gods and the fathers. Obeisance to the fathers. Svāhā!"
2.11.37	Then, having deposited these (gifts) with the Brahmanas, he points to them with the thumb of the Brahmanas, without a nail, saying, "To him be svadha, salutations! To him be svadhas, salutations!"
2.11.38	He looks at those who are eating, saying, "I offer immortality to the one who is established in the breath," with five (verses). "My Self is in Brahman for immortality," he says about himself.
2.11.39	And he does not look up, for the fathers are ashamed.
2.11.40	Satisfying all the desires, he recites the Brahmanic verses connected with the Svādhitis, and the Rakshas-subduing and the Nairrita verses.
2.11.41	At the end of the satisfaction, having said "Are you satisfied?" he replies, "We are satisfied."
2.11.31	For Angiras, for help, we call Yama, the lord of the Fathers. This offering is for Vaivasvata Yama. Accept our oblation, O Agni, the bearer of oblations, for the Fathers who increase the truth. Carry the oblation to the Gods and Fathers. Svāhā to the Fathers. Svāha to the Fathers.
2.11.32	O Agni, the bearer, of oblations, do thou honour the Fathers who increase truth. Carry the offering to the Gods and to the Fathers. To the Gods and Fathers, Svāhā.
2.11.33	Then he offers the Aṣṭaka-homa: "This is the one that first fell down." "The fifteen who saw the earlier one." "The image of the year." "These are the seventeen."
2.11.42	Having satisfied them, he scatters the remnants of food in the sacrificial fires, saying: "May those beings who have been burnt by fire, and those who have not been burnt in my family, be satisfied with the food given on the ground. May the satisfied ones attain the highest state."
2.11.43	Then, sprinkling them with water, he scatters them, and having them recite "May it be tasty," he propitiates them with gifts.
2.11.44	Having worshipped with gold, silver, cattle, garments, metals, land, utensils, cows, horses, goats, sheep, elephants, slaves, men, barley, wheat, beans, sesame, sticks, shoes, umbrellas, water-pots, vehicles, seats, beds, pillows, and all utensils, according to one's means, having recited the imperishable (hymns), having taken them up, having recited the Svadha (hymn), having risen, having pleased, having satisfied, having circumambulated, having permitted the remainder, having come back by the same way as he went, he offers the remaining food. He should do as they say. He should be permitted by them.
2.11.45	Then, having been permitted, having spread darbha grass with their tips towards the south around the fire on the right side, he offers a ball of food to the Pitrs with the words "To the Pitrs, svadha, salutations." Twenty-four times.
2.11.34	Then having cut the cake into eight pieces, having offered three portions according to the procedure of the Vapa, and having given the remaining ones to the Brahmanas, having covered these portions with the Idasu, having mixed the rice, meat and soup with ghee, he offers the Upghāta in the southern half with the ladle made of Udumbara wood, saying, "To the Pitrs, Svāhā!

To the friends, Svāhā ” !” “To the friends' wives, Svāhā .” “To the relatives, Svāhā.” “To the relatives' wives, Svähä .” “To the ministers, Svāhā." "To the ministers' wives, Svāhà ! To all, Svāhā" !” “To all, Svāha !”
2.11.46	Then he sprinkles them three times with water, flowing towards the left, with the verse, "Carrying nourishment, nectar, ghee, honey, milk, and the flowing Kalila, may it be sweet. Satisfy my ancestors. May they be satisfied, may they be satisfied, be satisfied."
2.11.47	From the beginning of the victory ceremony until the gift of the cow, everything is accomplished.
2.11.35	To Agni, the carrier of oblations, the performer of the last rites, Svāhā! Oṃ! In the southeast corner.
2.11.48	At the time of sipping water, at the time of facing the fire, at the time when the teacher instructs, at the time while reciting, at the time after the Homa, one should wear the Yajñopavīta.
2.11.49	Otherwise, one should wear it in the opposite direction.
2.11.50	In the same way, on the next day, with the remaining meat, in the same way, if it is for three days.
2.11.51	If one does not obtain a cow, one should sacrifice a goat or a sheep.
2.11.36	Having taken up the rice-gruel in the vessels, having placed the special offerings, having mixed it with the remnants of the oblation, having placed it on the Darbha grass with the tips towards the south, having covered it with Darbha grass with their tips towards the south and having touched it, he says, "Your vessel is earth, your cover is heaven. I offer you in the mouth of Brahma. I offer you to the Brahmanas who know the Vedas. I offer you into the life and out-breath. You are inexhaustible. You are the father of the fathers, the grandfather of the grandfathers, the great-grandfather of the great-grandfathers. You are the best in this world and the other world."
2.11.55	Or, one may offer only roots and fruits.
2.11.56	Or, one may offer gold.
2.11.57	Or, he may offer a cow.
2.11.58	Or, bring water pots from the river.
2.11.59	Or, recite the Śrāddha mantras.
2.11.60	Or, perform the Kākṣa ritual with forest fire on the Ekāṣṭaka day.
2.11.37	Then, having deposited these (gifts) with the Brahmanas, he points to them with the thumb of the Brahmanas, without a nail, saying, "To him be svadha, salutations! To him be svadhas, salutations!"
2.11.38	He looks at those who are eating, saying, "I offer immortality to the one who is established in the breath," with five (verses). "My Self is in Brahman for immortality," he says about himself.
2.11.61	But it should not be less than eight.
2.11.62	Sand is the purifying substance at a śrāddha, if it is for sprinkling or for scattering.
2.11.63	Kusha grass, kuttapa grass, and dūrvā grass are the purifying substances at a śrādha, if it is to be used for a seat, for covering, or for sweeping.
2.11.39	And he does not look up, for the fathers are ashamed.
2.11.40	Satisfying all the desires, he recites the Brahmanic verses connected with the Svādhitis, and the Rakshas-subduing and the Nairrita verses.
2.11.41	At the end of the satisfaction, having said "Are you satisfied?" he replies, "We are satisfied."
2.11.64-66	Tila is pure in a śrāddha, if it is for giving, if it is to be eaten, if it is mixed with water. A sword is pure in a sraddha, if it be meat, if it be a vessel made of bone. A grandson is pure in a srāddha, if he is the eater, if he is a surrounding, if he is an announcer.
2.11.42	Having satisfied them, he scatters the remnants of food in the sacrificial fires, saying: "May those beings who have been burnt by fire, and those who have not been burnt in my family, be satisfied with the food given on the ground. May the satisfied ones attain the highest state."
2.11.43	Then, sprinkling them with water, he scatters them, and having them recite "May it be tasty," he propitiates them with gifts.
2.11.67	In the same way, the Śrāddha for the departed ancestors is performed on any one day of the dark fortnight.
2.11.68	This is the only difference here. There is no Aṣṭakā Homa here.
2.11.69	Thus Aṣṭakās are explained.
2.11.70	Thus these seven Pākayajñas are explained.
2.12.1	Now Aṣṭakāhomas.
2.12.2	Now Pratyavarohaṇam.
2.12.3	Now Vaiśvadevam.
2.12.4	Now Balīharanam.
2.12.5	Now Śūlagavaḥ.
2.11.44	Having worshipped with gold, silver, cattle, garments, metals, land, utensils, cows, horses, goats, sheep, elephants, slaves, men, barley, wheat, beans, sesame, sticks, shoes, umbrellas, water-pots, vehicles, seats, beds, pillows, and all utensils, according to one's means, having recited the imperishable (hymns), having taken them up, having recited the Svadha (hymn), having risen, having pleased, having satisfied, having circumambulated, having permitted the remainder, having come back by the same way as he went, he offers the remaining food. He should do as they say. He should be permitted by them.
2.11.45	Then, having been permitted, having spread darbha grass with their tips towards the south around the fire on the right side, he offers a ball of food to the Pitrs with the words "To the Pitrs, svadha, salutations." Twenty-four times.
2.11.46	Then he sprinkles them three times with water, flowing towards the left, with the verse, "Carrying nourishment, nectar, ghee, honey, milk, and the flowing Kalila, may it be sweet. Satisfy my ancestors. May they be satisfied, may they be satisfied, be satisfied."
2.11.47	From the beginning of the victory ceremony until the gift of the cow, everything is accomplished.
2.12.15	The tonsure ceremony is performed in the first year.
2.12.16	Then the Ahuti ceremony is performed in eighth month of pregnancy.
2.12.17	It has been said that one should bathe after learning the Vedas.

2.12.19	Then the Baliharana ceremony.
2.12.20	Then Vaishvadev ceremony.
2.12.21	Then Pratyavaranana ceremony.
2.12.22	Now the Ashtakahoma ceremony.
3.1.1	The Upakarman ceremony is performed as an imitation of the Ahuti ceremony.
3.1.2	It is performed on the full moon day of Sravan or on the full moon of Ashadha.
3.1.3	When the pupils have been initiated.
3.1.4	Then, having drawn the altar for the gods, etc., he offers four principal oblations from the mouth of the fire to the deities of the sacrifice, to the deities of Saṃhitā, to the deities belonging to Varuṇa, and to all the deities.
2.11.48	At the time of sipping water, at the time of facing the fire, at the time when the teacher instructs, at the time while reciting, at the time after the Homa, one should wear the Yajñopavīta.
2.11.49	Otherwise, one should wear it in the opposite direction.
2.11.50	In the same way, on the next day, with the remaining meat, in the same way, if it is for three days.
2.11.51	If one does not obtain a cow, one should sacrifice a goat or a sheep.
2.11.52	with meat of the wild animals, as may be available.
2.11.53	The meat of the animals like the tiger, rhinoceros, goat, boar, deer, hare, lion, elephant, partridge, pigeon, quail, and the vulture, mixed with sesamum and honey, is inexhaustible.
2.11.54	Similarly, fish with Shatavala or milk-rice or soup-rice.

3.1.6	Then he offers to the lord of the assembly: "To the lord of the Assembly, the wonderful, dear, desired, and agreeable companion of Indra, I seek the wisdom, svāhā.
2.11.55	Or, one may offer only roots and fruits.
2.11.56	Or, one may offer gold.
2.11.57	Or, he may offer a cow.
2.11.58	Or, bring water pots from the river.
2.11.59	Or, recite the Śrāddha mantras.
2.11.60	Or, perform the Kākṣa ritual with forest fire on the Ekāṣṭaka day.
3.1.7	Then he offers to Savitri with the verse, "This is the most excellent of Savitri."

3.1.10	From "Victory" onwards, it is accomplished up to the gift of the cow.
3.1.11	Then he satisfies the Brahmins with cakes, cooked barley, barley flour, and rice, if he has them.
3.1.12	Having recited, "May the sages, the Vedas, the teachers, and the sacrifices be pleased."
2.11.64-66	Tila is pure in a śrāddha, if it is for giving, if it is to be eaten, if it is mixed with water. A sword is pure in a sraddha, if it be meat, if it be a vessel made of bone. A grandson is pure in a srāddha, if he is the eater, if he is a surrounding, if he is an announcer.
3.1.13	They should not study for three days or one day.
3.1.14	They should not study for a month at dusk.
3.1.15	And always after eating.
3.1.16	From midnight, when there is thunder, the day is considered to be with dusk, and it is not a day for study. When the sun has set, and there is lightning, it is not a study day until the end of sleep.
3.1.17	In the same way, when a section is begun and completed.
3.1.18	That is the one section-rishi.
2.11.67	In the same way, the Śrāddha for the departed ancestors is performed on any one day of the dark fortnight.
2.11.68	This is the only difference here. There is no Aṣṭakā Homa here.
2.11.69	Thus Aṣṭakās are explained.
2.11.70	Thus these seven Pākayajñas are explained.
2.12.1	Now Aṣṭakāhomas.
2.12.2	Now Pratyavarohaṇam.
2.12.3	Now Vaiśvadevam.

3.1.19	And of that one section, this is the first chapter.
3.1.20	And of that one section this is the day of no study.
3.1.21	Thus, in the section on the division of the sections, there is only this much difference. Here there is no chapter. The Sabrahmaṇas and the Anubrahmaṇas are the Prajapatya ones, namely, the Pauroḍāśika, the Yājamāna, the Hotṛ, and the Hotr.
3.1.22	The Adhvaryu, the Grahas, the Dakshina, the Samishtayajus, the Avabhrityajus, the Vajapeya, the Shukriya, the Savas, these are the Brahmanas with their sub-Brahmanas and the Somas.

3.3.34	By this, the rites of the Dātrīntara, Śaiva, Bahurūpa, Pārṣada, Skanda, and Indra are completed. One should practice Brahma, and obtain the Soma-drink according to the Rk, Sāman, or Yajus verses. This is what Bodhāyana said.
3.4.1	Now we shall explain the minor consecration.
3.3.7	Then he offers the principal oblations as prescribed, to the deities of the sacrifice, to the deities in the heaven, with the formula, "Svāhā." Four oblations.
3.3.8	Then he offers to the sage Kaṇḍa, with the formula "To the self-existent sage Kaṇḍā, Svāhā."
3.3.9	Then he offers the lord of the assembly, with the formula "Lord of the assembly."
3.3.10	Then he makes an offering to Savitri, with the formula beginning with "That of Savitri."
3.4.2	Having shaved off the hair on the head and beard, having performed the rites as before, having gone out towards the east or the west from the village, having kindled the fire in the open sky, having spread it around, having placed the Madanti plants, having performed the peace rite with the first Anuvaka, he prepares seats for the deities of Pravargya with darbha grass.
3.3.11	Then he offers oblations to the Vedas: "Svāhā to the Ṛg Veda, Svāhā to the Yajur Veda, Svāha to the Sāma Veda, Svāh to the Atharva Veda, Svāhá to the Atharvan-Angirasas, Svāhā, to the Itihāsa-Purāṇas, Svāhā to the serpent-gods, Svāhā."
3.3.12	Then he makes the four Udumbara twigs, with their tips not dried up, smeared with ghee, and makes them recite.
3.3.13	Of any of the trees used in sacrifices.
3.4.3	In front of the fire, I consecrate for Pravargya, for Gharmā, for Mahāvīra, for Samrāṭ.
3.4.4	To the right of the fire, for Brahmā, for Prajāpati, I consecrate.
3.4.5	To the left of the fire, to the sages, to the creators of mantras, to the lords of mantras, I consecrate; to the gods who drink Gharmā, I consecrate.
3.3.14	O Agni, lord of vows, I shall observe the vow that is measured by forty-eight. May I be able to do it. Svāhā. O Vayu, lord of vows... O Aditya, lord of vows ... O lord of vows, lord of vows. I shall observe the vows that are measured by forty-eights. May I be capable of doing it. Svāha. Thus it is said.
3.4.6	Then, facing the south, with the sacred thread passing over the left shoulder, he says, "I consecrate to the Pitrs, the eaters of food, to Yama, to Angiras, to the Pitrs."
3.4.7	Then, having touched water, facing the north, with the sacred-thread passing over the right shoulder, he says,
3.3.15	From Jaya onwards, it is accomplished by giving the gift of a cow.
3.3.16	Thus, at the end of the vow, covering the lower navel and upper knees, touching water three times, subsisting on food cooked without fire, eating in the shade, one should enter the house only if ordered by the guru.
3.3.17	One should eat alms at that time.
3.3.18	One may eat roots, tubers, and fruits.
3.4.8	Having sprinkled the fire clockwise, having placed the Vāyavīti Samidh twigs with the Vyāhṛtis, he makes offerings to the Pravargya deities with the Madantī verses.
3.4.9	"He makes offerings to the east of the fire, saying, "I make offerings to the Pravaryga, I make offerings to the Mahāvīra, I make offerings the Samrāṭ."
3.4.10	"He makes offers to the south of the fire, "I make offers to the Brahman, I make offers to Prajapati."
3.3.19	After having sipped water in the afternoon, he should not use it.
3.3.20	He should not converse with women, Śūdras, fallen ones, or with one who is menstruating.
3.3.21	One may converse with one's mother, preceptor's wife, and sister.
3.3.22	And with other women who are thus engaged, but are incapable of valour.
3.3.23	The Vyāhrtis with Pranava, the Agnihotra, the begging for alms, the places for sitting and lying down, the sprinkling of water, the offering of flowers, and the offering of food.
3.4.11	To the north of the fire, he offers libations to the sages, the creators of mantras, the lords of mantras, and to the gods who drink hot water.
3.4.12	Then, facing east, he offers libation to the ancestors who drink hot water, to Yama, the son of Angiras, and to the ancestors.
3.4.13	Then, having touched water, facing north, wearing the sacred thread over the right shoulder, he offers libiration to Rudra, the Rudra-priest.
3.4.14	Then, having touched water, he says, "I gratify all the deities of the Pravargya rite."
3.4.15	Then he makes the four Udumbara kindling woods, with fresh tips and smeared with ghee, fall down, reciting the verses, "The earth is the kindling wood..." individually.
3.3.24	He should offer libations to all the deities, saying, "I offer libations to Brahma, I offer libations to Prajapati, I offer libulations to Parameṣṭhin, I offer libatious to Śtānu, I offer libation to Śiva, I offer libatiou to Śarva, I offer libatian to Bahurūpa, I offer libatien to Skanda, I offer libatians to Indra, I offer libaticns to Yama, I offer libactions to the sages, I offer libactica to the ancestors, I offer libacions to all the deities." Having recited this, he should conclude.
3.4.16	Then the deity approaches him: "O Agni, lord of vows, I shall observe the pure vow. May I be able to do it, may it succeed for me." "O Vayu, lord of vows..." "O Aditya, lord of vows...." "O lord of vows, lord of vows..., I shall observe the bright vow. May I succeed in it, may it be accomplished for me."
3.3.25	The Guru’s conduct should be followed by those who are of the same conduct as the Guru.
3.3.26	One who is sent should do only that and not anything else, except for a sin.
3.3.27	Thus one should observe the vow for twelve years, eleven, nine, seven, five, three, six months, four months, two months, or one month.
3.4.17	Then he makes them recite the verses of these sections, beginning with the first and ending with the last.
3.4.18	Then he instructs him, saying, "Control your speech and close your eyes."
3.4.19	Then he covers his head three times clockwise with a new cloth, saying, "Be covered, be completely covered, svāhā. Be covered by the Maruts."
3.3.28	Or, one who is learned, a brahmin, may perform the twelve-night Paraka vow, but not without the consent of his wife.
3.3.29	He purifies himself, the twenty-one generations of his ancestors, and the twenty-one future generations.
3.4.20	Having circumambulated the fire and sprinkled it, having placed the Vaikankati kindling woods with the Vyahrtis, having offered oblations to the Pravargya deities with the Madanti verses, having performed the Shanti rite with the last Anuvaka, they then return to the village when the sun has set.
3.4.21	One should remain silent and sit or lie down during this night.
3.3.30	Whatever he points out, on which he sits, to whom he gives, and from whom he receives, all that he purifies.
3.3.31	At the conclusion of the vow or the conclusion of the Veda, the righteous one should offer the teacher's fee according to his ability.
3.3.32	If the teacher has passed away, one should offer it from a fierce or a Shudra.
3.4.22	Then, when the sun has risen in the morning, having gone out of the village towards the east or west, having placed the fire in the open sky, having spread it around, having placed the Madanti plants, having performed the peace with the first Anuvaka, having arranged seats for the deities of the Pravargya with darbha grass, having removed the garment with the verse "O Suparnas, the birds," he then shows him the sixfold: "Fire, water, sun, cow, Brahman, gold."
3.3.33	Some say that it is Dharma to take even from a Śūdra for the sake of the teacher, if he is in distress.
3.3.34	By this, the rites of the Dātrīntara, Śaiva, Bahurūpa, Pārṣada, Skanda, and Indra are completed. One should practice Brahma, and obtain the Soma-drink according to the Rk, Sāman, or Yajus verses. This is what Bodhāyana said.
3.4.1	Now we shall explain the minor consecration.
3.4.23	Having shown the three (kinds of) fire at the beginning, having shown the others in due order, having sprinkled the fire clockwise, having placed the Vaikankati kindling woods with the Vyāhṛtis, having gratified the Pravargya deities with the Madantī verses, having performed the Śānti rite with the last Anuvāka, then he should instruct him in the conduct of his vow.
3.4.2	Having shaved off the hair on the head and beard, having performed the rites as before, having gone out towards the east or the west from the village, having kindled the fire in the open sky, having spread it around, having placed the Madanti plants, having performed the peace rite with the first Anuvaka, he prepares seats for the deities of Pravargya with darbha grass.
3.4.24	He should not ride in a vehicle, nor climb a tree, nor descend into a well, nor hold an umbrella, nor wear sandals, nor lie on a couch, nor converse with a woman or a Śūdra. If he does converse, he should converse with a Brāhmaṇa. He should not eat in the evening. If he does eat in the evening, he should eat from a burning fire. He should not bathe on the eighth day of the lunar month, nor on a festival day. He should fast on that day and bathe. He should observe silence and spend that night sitting or lying down.
3.4.3	In front of the fire, I consecrate for Pravargya, for Gharmā, for Mahāvīra, for Samrāṭ.
3.4.4	To the right of the fire, for Brahmā, for Prajāpati, I consecrate.
3.4.5	To the left of the fire, to the sages, to the creators of mantras, to the lords of mantras, I consecrate; to the gods who drink Gharmā, I consecrate.
3.4.25	When he sees a vessel containing filth, blood, or a corpse, he should look at the lights.
3.4.26	Seeing filth, he recites: "The mind is bound, the eye is poor, the sun is the best of lights, may you not abandon me in the consecration."
3.4.27	If it rains on him, he recites there: "May the strength increase, may my consecration and austerity not be destroyed."
3.4.6	Then, facing the south, with the sacred thread passing over the left shoulder, he says, "I consecrate to the Pitrs, the eaters of food, to Yama, to Angiras, to the Pitrs."
3.4.7	Then, having touched water, facing the north, with the sacred-thread passing over the right shoulder, he says,
3.4.28	One should observe this vow for a year, for the vow is not to be transgressed for a year. But one should study in this very year.
3.4.29	If one does not study in this very (year), one should observe the vow for as long as one studies. When the year is over, one teaches or recites.
3.4.8	Having sprinkled the fire clockwise, having placed the Vāyavīti Samidh twigs with the Vyāhṛtis, he makes offerings to the Pravargya deities with the Madantī verses.
3.4.9	"He makes offerings to the east of the fire, saying, "I make offerings to the Pravaryga, I make offerings to the Mahāvīra, I make offerings the Samrāṭ."
3.4.10	"He makes offers to the south of the fire, "I make offers to the Brahman, I make offers to Prajapati."
3.4.30	Having performed the preliminary rites as before, having gone out towards the east or the north from the village, having placed the fire in the open sky, having spread it around, having placed the Madantī plants, having performed the Śānti rite with the first Anuvāka, having arranged seats for the Pravargya deities with Darbha grass, then he offers the Avratya and Prāyaścitta oblations with the two verses, "Whatever evil has befallen me, Agni has given me sight again."
3.4.11	To the north of the fire, he offers libations to the sages, the creators of mantras, the lords of mantras, and to the gods who drink hot water.
3.4.12	Then, facing east, he offers libation to the ancestors who drink hot water, to Yama, the son of Angiras, and to the ancestors.
3.4.13	Then, having touched water, facing north, wearing the sacred thread over the right shoulder, he offers libiration to Rudra, the Rudra-priest.
3.4.31	Having sprinkled the fire clockwise, having placed the Vāyavīti Samidh twigs with the Vyāhṛtis, having offered libations to the Pravargya deities with the Madantī verses, having placed the four Udumbara Samidh twigs with their tips not dried up and smeared with ghee, he makes them recite the following verses in sequence: "The sky is the Samidh," and so on.
3.4.14	Then, having touched water, he says, "I gratify all the deities of the Pravargya rite."
3.4.15	Then he makes the four Udumbara kindling woods, with fresh tips and smeared with ghee, fall down, reciting the verses, "The earth is the kindling wood..." individually.
3.4.32	Then the deity approaches him: "O Aditya, lord of vows, I have observed the pure vow. I was not able to do it. Grant me that. O Vayu, lord of vows... O Agni, lord of vows ... O lord of vows, lord of vows..."
3.4.16	Then the deity approaches him: "O Agni, lord of vows, I shall observe the pure vow. May I be able to do it, may it succeed for me." "O Vayu, lord of vows..." "O Aditya, lord of vows...." "O lord of vows, lord of vows..., I shall observe the bright vow. May I succeed in it, may it be accomplished for me."
3.4.17	Then he makes them recite the verses of these sections, beginning with the first and ending with the last.
3.4.18	Then he instructs him, saying, "Control your speech and close your eyes."
3.4.19	Then he covers his head three times clockwise with a new cloth, saying, "Be covered, be completely covered, svāhā. Be covered by the Maruts."
3.4.33	Having circumambulated the fire, having sprinkled it with the Vyāhṛtis, having placed the Samidh twigs, having worshipped the Pravargya deities with the Madanti verses, having performed the Śānti rite with the last Anuvāka, he should then instruct the student about the days when he should not study. He should not study when the sun has set, when it has not risen, when it is dark, when it has turned around, when it is in the shadow of a cloud, when it is at the end of a domestic animal, when it is the end of a wild animal, when it sees green barley, when it is near houses, when it is a corpse, when it sees blood being produced, when it sees meat, when it has eaten at a Śrāddha, when it has applied oil to its hair and beard, when it has spread its hair, when it runs with its teeth, when it is smeared, when it is anointed, when it is wet, when it is with a wet garment, when it is on wet ground.
3.4.20	Having circumambulated the fire and sprinkled it, having placed the Vaikankati kindling woods with the Vyahrtis, having offered oblations to the Pravargya deities with the Madanti verses, having performed the Shanti rite with the last Anuvaka, they then return to the village when the sun has set.
3.4.21	One should remain silent and sit or lie down during this night.
3.4.34	Then he should study the Veda, sitting on Darbha grass, holding Darbha grass, and reciting the Veda with his face towards the east. Having again performed the rite of peace, he should study.
3.4.35	If he should recite the worldly (hymns), then wherever he sees anything that is not peaceful, he should again perform the peace-making and recite the supreme Pravargya. Having gone out for the Upavasatha, he may recite something else without entering (the house).
3.5.1	The propitiation of the Vastu is the peace-making.
3.4.22	Then, when the sun has risen in the morning, having gone out of the village towards the east or west, having placed the fire in the open sky, having spread it around, having placed the Madanti plants, having performed the peace with the first Anuvaka, having arranged seats for the deities of the Pravargya with darbha grass, having removed the garment with the verse "O Suparnas, the birds," he then shows him the sixfold: "Fire, water, sun, cow, Brahman, gold."
3.4.23	Having shown the three (kinds of) fire at the beginning, having shown the others in due order, having sprinkled the fire clockwise, having placed the Vaikankati kindling woods with the Vyāhṛtis, having gratified the Pravargya deities with the Madantī verses, having performed the Śānti rite with the last Anuvāka, then he should instruct him in the conduct of his vow.
3.5.6	Now some of them erect the post with a Yajus formula, the bamboos with a Yajur formula, the grass with a Yajurs formula, the covering with a Yajura formula, the place for the bed with a Yajurus formula, the middle of the house with a Yajrus formula, and the place for the fire with a Yajuru formula.
3.4.24	He should not ride in a vehicle, nor climb a tree, nor descend into a well, nor hold an umbrella, nor wear sandals, nor lie on a couch, nor converse with a woman or a Śūdra. If he does converse, he should converse with a Brāhmaṇa. He should not eat in the evening. If he does eat in the evening, he should eat from a burning fire. He should not bathe on the eighth day of the lunar month, nor on a festival day. He should fast on that day and bathe. He should observe silence and spend that night sitting or lying down.
3.5.7	If he were to do it in the manner of the Yajurveda, then the Sāman, Rk, Yajus and Atharvanic (verses) would be united and would be born together. If he were to decide in the manner of their being born together, then it would be so if it were done in the manner of Yajus.
3.5.8	Diseases, ailments, demons and calamities would occur.
3.4.25	When he sees a vessel containing filth, blood, or a corpse, he should look at the lights.
3.4.26	Seeing filth, he recites: "The mind is bound, the eye is poor, the sun is the best of lights, may you not abandon me in the consecration."
3.4.27	If it rains on him, he recites there: "May the strength increase, may my consecration and austerity not be destroyed."
3.5.9	Therefore, having built a house silently, having adorned the door area, having filled the middle of the house with plaster, having arranged a bed, having placed the domestic fire in the northeast corner of the house, having spread it around, having made it face the fire, he offers cooked oblations, reciting the Puronuvākyā "O Vastospati, accept us" and the Yājyā "O Vastosapati, with your auspicious presence".
3.4.28	One should observe this vow for a year, for the vow is not to be transgressed for a year. But one should study in this very year.
3.4.29	If one does not study in this very (year), one should observe the vow for as long as one studies. When the year is over, one teaches or recites.
3.5.10	Then he offers the oblations of ghee.
3.5.11	O Vasat-pati, you are the firm pillar of the Soma-drinking ones. The drop is the divider of the ancient and eternal ones. Indra is the friend of the sages. Svāhā.
3.5.12	If there is fear from two-legged creatures, or if there is fear from four-legged creatures, may Agni, the most excellent one, dispel that fear. May there be peace for our offspring, may there be peace for us, and for our cattle. Svāhā.
3.4.30	Having performed the preliminary rites as before, having gone out towards the east or the north from the village, having placed the fire in the open sky, having spread it around, having placed the Madantī plants, having performed the Śānti rite with the first Anuvāka, having arranged seats for the Pravargya deities with Darbha grass, then he offers the Avratya and Prāyaścitta oblations with the two verses, "Whatever evil has befallen me, Agni has given me sight again."
3.5.13	Whatever fear there is in the blinking of the eyes, in the trembling of the limbs, or in harsh words, may Agni, the most excellent, dispel that fear. May it be for our welfare, for our offspring, and for our cattle. Svāhā!
3.4.31	Having sprinkled the fire clockwise, having placed the Vāyavīti Samidh twigs with the Vyāhṛtis, having offered libations to the Pravargya deities with the Madantī verses, having placed the four Udumbara Samidh twigs with their tips not dried up and smeared with ghee, he makes them recite the following verses in sequence: "The sky is the Samidh," and so on.
3.5.14	In bad dreams, in sinful dreams, whatever fear there is, whatever is the destroyer of dreams, whatever is the sight of impurity, may Agni, the most excellent one, dispel that fear. May it be auspicious for our offspring, may it be auspicious for us, svāhā.
3.4.32	Then the deity approaches him: "O Aditya, lord of vows, I have observed the pure vow. I was not able to do it. Grant me that. O Vayu, lord of vows... O Agni, lord of vows ... O lord of vows, lord of vows..."
3.5.15	O Vastospati, be our protector, the bestower of cattle and horses, O Indra, the immortal. May we be in thy friendship like sons to their father. Accept us. Svāhā.
3.5.16	O Vastospati, the remover of evil, entering all forms, be a good friend to us. Svāha.
3.5.17	From the Svishtakrit onwards, it is accomplished up to the gift of a cow.
3.5.18	Then he places the remnant of the oblation on the darbha-blades in front of the fire, with the verse, "Salutations to Rudra, the lord of the house, to the one who leads, to the one that drives away, to the one in the garden, to the one for whom there is no refuge, to the one revolving, to the one returning, to the one protecting, I offer salutations to him."
3.5.19	Having taken the water in which the pot was washed and the remaining ghee in a vessel, he sprinkles all around with a twig of Udumbara, Palasha or Sami or with a handful of Darbha grass, going around the house three times clockwise, reciting the verse, "You are the sage, you are the poet, you are bearing all forms, you dispel the fear of the unborn."
3.4.33	Having circumambulated the fire, having sprinkled it with the Vyāhṛtis, having placed the Samidh twigs, having worshipped the Pravargya deities with the Madanti verses, having performed the Śānti rite with the last Anuvāka, he should then instruct the student about the days when he should not study. He should not study when the sun has set, when it has not risen, when it is dark, when it has turned around, when it is in the shadow of a cloud, when it is at the end of a domestic animal, when it is the end of a wild animal, when it sees green barley, when it is near houses, when it is a corpse, when it sees blood being produced, when it sees meat, when it has eaten at a Śrāddha, when it has applied oil to its hair and beard, when it has spread its hair, when it runs with its teeth, when it is smeared, when it is anointed, when it is wet, when it is with a wet garment, when it is on wet ground.
3.5.20	Having sanctified the food, having worshipped the Brahmins, having recited the benedictions, one should say "May the house be auspicious, may the house be auspicious."
3.5.21	The propitiation of the house has been explained.
3.4.34	Then he should study the Veda, sitting on Darbha grass, holding Darbha grass, and reciting the Veda with his face towards the east. Having again performed the rite of peace, he should study.
3.4.35	If he should recite the worldly (hymns), then wherever he sees anything that is not peaceful, he should again perform the peace-making and recite the supreme Pravargya. Having gone out for the Upavasatha, he may recite something else without entering (the house).
3.5.1	The propitiation of the Vastu is the peace-making.
3.6.1	Now if a pillar in the house should grow, or a pigeon should be in the house, or a crow should enter the house, or if a cow should be milked, or a cow should milk herself, or a bull should scratch the sky, or smoke should arise from a fireless place, or a fireless place should blaze, or honey should arise, or an anthill should arise, or a hole should arise, or mushrooms should arise, or frogs should lay eggs, or a dog should give birth, or a snake should bite the householder or his wife, one should know these as other portents.
3.5.2	When he is about to go away after having stayed for ten days, he goes away after having offered the Vastospatiya oblation, taking his wife and Agnihotra along with him.
3.5.3	Some say that all who have installed the sacred fire.
3.5.4	Some say those who are going away.
3.5.5	When one has built a house and is about to occupy it for the first time, one should occupy it after having appeased it with the Vastospati oblation.
3.6.2	Then, having drawn the lines for the assembly of the gods, etc., from the mouth of the fire, he offers from the cooked (rice). "O Indra, we fear you, the giver of welfare, the lord of the shining ones." With these two verses.
3.6.3	Then he offers oblations of ghee: "O Vashatpati, O Vashatpati, may the goddesses be auspicious to us. Indra and Agni, the shining ones, what bright thing is there for us? Who yokes today? May you be of one mind with us."
3.5.6	Now some of them erect the post with a Yajus formula, the bamboos with a Yajur formula, the grass with a Yajurs formula, the covering with a Yajura formula, the place for the bed with a Yajurus formula, the middle of the house with a Yajrus formula, and the place for the fire with a Yajuru formula.
3.6.4	From the Svishtakrit onwards, it is accomplished up to the gift of the cow.
3.6.5	Then with the verse, "May the goddesses protect us for prosperity," he places the remaining oblations on the Samī leaves near the fire.
3.6.6	Having collected the water used for washing the pot and the remaining ghee in a vessel, he should place it in the sacrificial pits or sprinkle it with the verse, “We have chosen the auspicious one.”
3.5.7	If he were to do it in the manner of the Yajurveda, then the Sāman, Rk, Yajus and Atharvanic (verses) would be united and would be born together. If he were to decide in the manner of their being born together, then it would be so if it were done in the manner of Yajus.
3.5.8	Diseases, ailments, demons and calamities would occur.
3.6.7	Having sanctified the food and worshipped the Brahmins, having recited the benedictory verses, he sprinkles it with the words "May it be auspicious, may it be auspicious."
3.6.8	The auspicious rite has been explained.
3.7.1	The oblation for longevity is performed in imitation of the invitation.
3.7.2	Every year, every six months, every four months, every month, or at the time of the birth of the prince, it should be performed.
3.5.9	Therefore, having built a house silently, having adorned the door area, having filled the middle of the house with plaster, having arranged a bed, having placed the domestic fire in the northeast corner of the house, having spread it around, having made it face the fire, he offers cooked oblations, reciting the Puronuvākyā "O Vastospati, accept us" and the Yājyā "O Vastosapati, with your auspicious presence".
3.5.10	Then he offers the oblations of ghee.
3.5.11	O Vasat-pati, you are the firm pillar of the Soma-drinking ones. The drop is the divider of the ancient and eternal ones. Indra is the friend of the sages. Svāhā.
3.5.12	If there is fear from two-legged creatures, or if there is fear from four-legged creatures, may Agni, the most excellent one, dispel that fear. May there be peace for our offspring, may there be peace for us, and for our cattle. Svāhā.
3.7.6	He pours down rice.
3.7.7	Having sprinkled them, having washed them three times, he puts them down.
3.7.8	Then, having placed water or milk in a vessel behind the strainer, he pours down rice behind the strainer.
3.7.9	Then he pours down ghee, then he puts down ghee. Having heated both, he cleans the ladle and the spoon.
3.5.13	Whatever fear there is in the blinking of the eyes, in the trembling of the limbs, or in harsh words, may Agni, the most excellent, dispel that fear. May it be for our welfare, for our offspring, and for our cattle. Svāhā!
3.7.10	Having cooked this rice-gruel and having poured clarified butter over it, having taken it up with the ladle, having placed it in the prescribed place, he pours clarified butter over it.
3.7.11	In the same way, the rice-gruel is prepared for all the oblations.
3.5.14	In bad dreams, in sinful dreams, whatever fear there is, whatever is the destroyer of dreams, whatever is the sight of impurity, may Agni, the most excellent one, dispel that fear. May it be auspicious for our offspring, may it be auspicious for us, svāhā.
3.7.12	Having placed the Paridhana and other (materials) in front of the fire, he offers from the cooked (rice). Having recited the Puronuvākyā, "May your life be established in all directions", he offers with the Yājyā, "O Agni, giver of life, accepting the oblation".
3.5.15	O Vastospati, be our protector, the bestower of cattle and horses, O Indra, the immortal. May we be in thy friendship like sons to their father. Accept us. Svāhā.

3.5.19	Having taken the water in which the pot was washed and the remaining ghee in a vessel, he sprinkles all around with a twig of Udumbara, Palasha or Sami or with a handful of Darbha grass, going around the house three times clockwise, reciting the verse, "You are the sage, you are the poet, you are bearing all forms, you dispel the fear of the unborn."

3.7.22	The number of oblations offered twenty-six hundred and sixty times becomes eight thousand.
3.6.7	Having sanctified the food and worshipped the Brahmins, having recited the benedictory verses, he sprinkles it with the words "May it be auspicious, may it be auspicious."
3.6.8	The auspicious rite has been explained.
3.7.1	The oblation for longevity is performed in imitation of the invitation.

3.7.28	This is the right way for those afflicted by spirits. The five Chudas, the serpent-offerings, the Gandharva-offerings, and the daily recitation of the sacred texts for the sake of well-being, one should recite these sacred texts and offer oblations, and offer oblations with these same sacred texts. One becomes immune to poison. This is the right path for those who have offered oblations and performed offerings. Other offerings, oblations, and worship are based on the hermitages.

Having eaten and sipped water, he touches his belly with the two verses: "From whom we fear, O Indra, the lord of wealth, the giver of welfare."
3.7.27	For the princes who are possessed by planets, who are possessed by fever, who are afflicted by ghosts, he should recite the auspicious verses of ghee daily for their longevity. He should offer oblations with these very mantras and offer oblations with the same mantras. He becomes free from poison.

4.3.5	Then he yokes the southern bull with the verse, "We invoke the shining one, the knower of beings." Having yoked the left one with the verse, “The variegated army of the gods has risen,” he proceeds.
4.8.1	Now we shall explain the expiations. If a broken, lost, spoiled, inverted, split, or pierced fire-pan, or if a bird, cat, crow, jackal, animal, bird, reptile, or insect should go between the priests and the fires, one should offer the three great Vyāhṛtis, the thread-bearing ones, to the difficult-to-cross, the difficult-to know. That itself is the expiation.
4.3.6	If one crosses a sacred place by boat, he should recite this mantra while crossing: "May this tree, the lord of the forest, lead us safely to the other shore of the great ocean. May it be our protector, for long life and prosperity." If one sees a bride crossing by boat, he recites this mantra:
4.3.7	"Salutations to the ocean, the wind, the lord of rivers."
4.9.1	Now we shall explain the collection of expiations for the seven sacrificial rites.
4.9.2	The seven sacrificial rites are: Homa, Prahuta, Ahahuta, Shulaga, Baliharana, Pratyavarohaṇa, and Ashtakahoma. In these rites, no Prayājas are offered, no Anuyājas, and no Sāmidhenīs.
4.3.8	Having gone to a difficult place or road, he worships the sun with a thousand (recitations) with the formula, "Having gone to a difficult path, one worships the sun."
4.3.9	In the presence of danger, in gambling, in dealing with the king's court, in misfortune, or when bound, one should recite this silently continuously. In bad dreams, one should recite it a hundred times.
4.9.3	Having placed the fire in the prescribed manner and having spread it around, he offers the oblation of rice-gruel at every place where he performs the oblation with the ladle.
4.9.4	In case of loss, breakage, cutting, burning, inversion, burning, deficiency, excess, loss of the filter, or breakage of the vessel, he offers two oblations of rice-gruels.
4.4.1	Then if there is a calamity, the fire may be blown out. All that is removed. Having sprinkled, having taken up the mound, having placed the fire on it, having spread it around, having made it from the mouth of the fire, one offers from the cooked (fire) with the three verses, "Those gods who destroy the sacrifice, who consume the sacrifice" in the Anucchada metre.
4.4.2	From the Svishtakrit onwards, it is accomplished up to the giving of the cow as a gift.

4.4.3	If there is a difference in the dice, then having brought that fire to rest, having spread it around, having made it from the mouth of the fire, he offers the principal oblations: "Here be stability, svāhā! Here be support, svāhā!" Here be enjoyment, svāhā!” Here be delight, svāhā."
4.4.4	Victory and so on are accomplished up to the giving of the gift of a cow.
4.9.8	If the fire is extinguished, one should offer the four Hotr offerings and the Anuhya.
4.9.9	If there is an encounter between a frog, a snake, a rat, and a cat, one should offer five Hotr offerings and Anuhya.
4.9.10	In case of a distorted form, distorted sound, or bursting, one should offer Shamyuvaaka and Anuhya.
4.4.5	Then he takes up another dice, saying, "Thou art the unerring one; for the unerring one thee. Do not let me be deprived of thee in the other world."
4.4.6	Then he yokes him to the chariot, saying, "Stand up, O slayer of Vritra, to the chariot."
4.9.11	The general expiation not mentioned has been explained. One should mention the Varuni.
4.9.12	If the fire is extinguished at the end of the consecration, or if one does not obtain the ashes to be deposited, or the kindling wood, or if one performs the expiation prescribed for sacrifices, or offers the great formulas, the Praṇava, and the Manasvati.
4.9.13	In the case of errors in the Svaras, Aksaras, Pada, and Vritti, one should offer with these verses: "By these verses."
4.4.7	Then he establishes the pair on the chariot: "I stand in the kingdom, I stand in the country, I stand in horses, I stand in cattle, I stand in limbs, I stand in myself, I stand in progeny, in the future."
4.4.8	He yokes the animals as before. Then, having established the pair, he proceeds.
4.9.14	At every sacrifice, the sacrificer should give a cow, a bull and a horse to the members of the sacrifice.
4.9.15	The members should be made aware of all the expiations and substitutes.
4.4.9	If the stronger one is on the right, he moves the chariot along the path, saying, "May we be free from debt in this world, free from debt in the next world, free from all debts on the path, those who go to the gods and those who go to ancestors."
4.10.1	Now if the fire should be blown out at the time of the oblations, one should sprinkle it with the formula, "All that has been scattered," remove the sacrificial grass, kindle the fire, spread it around, and offer the expiation. The Agniya verses, the five Agniya verses, and the ten verses addressed to Agni, the oblations to the Maruts, the great Vyāhṛtis, and the Vyāhṛtis should be offered as expiation.
4.4.10	Then, standing on the path, he recites for the chariot: "May this be a safe journey for the couple. We have gone along the path. May there be safety and prosperity for the cattle. By which one encircles all enemies, one obtains wealth."
4.4.11	Then he approaches the chariot, reciting: "From path to path, from path to path."
4.4.12	If there is fear from lightning and thunder, he recites these two verses of Indra: "From whom we are afraid, O Indra, the giver of welfare, the lord of the shining ones."
4.4.13	Then he proceeds to the end of the ritual.
4.5.1	Now the expiation for the Pakayajnas.
4.10.2	If the fire of the Upanayana, the fire of the marriage, the fire of birth, the fire of cremation, or the fire from the fourth to the tenth day after the birth, or from the time of the collection of wood, is blown out, one should sprinkle it with the verse, "The Asuras have been destroyed." Then, having sprinkled it, one should quickly make it ascend to ashes. Having placed the fire on the kindling wood with the verse, “This is your natural place,” one should bring in the worldly fire and place the kindling wood, reciting the two verses, “Inviting, awaken, O Agni."
4.5.2	Thus, in the case of substances, oblations, mantras, rites, etc., which have been passed, spilled, broken, burnt, damaged, or destroyed, one should offer them with the following mantras: "The mind is light, the Agni is the light, whatever is in this rite, may there be well-being." "Indra, the one with increased fame," and with the Vyāhṛti mantras.
4.10.3	Having spread (the oblations), he offers the expiatory oblation. The Agniya, the Panchhotra, the Brahmana, the Ekhotra, the Dashamanasvati, the Mindahuti, the Mahavyahriti, and the Vyahrti, one should offer the expiatory offering, says Bodhayanin.
4.5.3	The teachers say that the use of the Vyahrtis is as it has been done and as it should be.
4.5.4	Here they quote: "Bhuh" for the verses, "Bhuvah" for the Yajuses, and "Suvar" for the Samans.
4.5.5	Baudhayana says that one should offer at the beginning of the rite, at the principal offering.
4.5.6	Saliki says at the end of the principal offering. 
4.5.7	Aupamanyava says before the Sviṣṭakṛt.
4.6.1	Then, the rites of Garbhadhana, Pumsavana, Simantonnayana, Visnu Bali, Jaatakarma, Namakarana, Upanisthakrama, Annaprasana, Chuda, Upanayana, etc. should not be performed. The rites are the same as those of the waters. The two Mindahuti offerings, the great Vyahrtis, and the expiatory offerings should be made.
4.6.2	In case of transgression of time, two Mindahuti oblations should be offered at the beginning of the principal rite.
4.11.1	Now, when the householder or the student has transgressed the time for the Agnihotra oblations, or the Darsa and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices, or the Agrayaṇa sacrifice, or when the wife has given birth to a child without the prescribed rites, or when there has been the birth of twins among women or cows, or intercourse with a menstruating woman, or conversation with an outcaste, or sexual intercourse during the day, or intercourse with an outcaste woman, or emission of semen at the end of a dream, or the passing of urine or feces in water, or when a young boy has been born without the prescribed rites or without the prescribed rites of fire-contact, or when there is confusion of deities, or confusion of mantras, or confusion of rites, or when the student has transgresseḍ the prescribed rites, and when the girdle, the sacrificial thread, the antelope skin, the water pot, the staff, the twilight rites, the fire rites, the water pot rites, the begging rites, the self-study rites, the service rites have been transgressed, or when there are other such transgressions, there is expiation.
4.6.3	All the teachers say that it is common to all.
4.6.4	Here they quote: "The cooked clarified butter of Souvikrit, the offering of the Prāṇīta, the Brahmana, the kindling wood and the sacrificial grass, this is known as the Brahmana."
4.11.2	Having kindled the fire and spread out the sacrificial grass, he offers the expiatory oblation: "Protect us, O Agni, from sin, svāhā! Protect us, O all-knowing one, svāhā. Protect the sacrifice, O Vibhāvasu, svāhā, protect everything, O Indra, svāhā." "Protect us, Agni, with one (oblation), protect with two, protect with three (oblations), O Lord of Energy, protect with four, O Vasu, svāha."
4.11.3	And in front and above, it is uninterrupted, continuous, in due order.

4.12.2	Having mentioned the seasons, viz., spring, summer, rainy season, autumn, winter, and the cold season, and having informed the Brahmanas, he then, at the end of the vow, leads the divine worship at dusk.

If the fire is kindled in the opposite direction then the expiatory rite is prescribed. The expiatory rite for the above is as follows: “Obeisance to the waters, the waters that are the source of cooking, the waters that have the mind, the waters that offer oblations, the waters that contain the great Vyāhṛtis and the Vyāhṛtis.” This is the view of Baudhāyana.

1.4.21	One should return from the sacrifice.
1.4.22	If at one time both rice and barley are being cooked, one should take the strong portions of one and think that it is done.
1.4.23	If at the same time food is cooked again and again, one should do the strong portions only once.
1.4.24	If this is accomplished first, then having placed it in front of the fire and given it to a brahmin, one should eat.
1.4.25	If this is accomplished last, then one should eat. Thus it is said.

1.4.24	If this is accomplished first, then having placed it in front of the fire and given it to a brahmin, one should eat.
1.4.25	If this is accomplished last, then one should eat. Thus it is said.

1.5.8	One should make the new moon when the moon is not visible at all.
1.5.9	Even when visible, it has gone beyond.
1.5.10	There are three times for the full moon: at dusk, when the sun has set and risen, or when it is high.

1.5.6	One worships the previous half-month with the new moon offering and the subsequent half-month with a full moon offering.
1.5.12	This is a separate chapter for this knowledge. One should study it or one should learn it from those who know it.
1.5.13	Now, on the day of fasting, having offered the morning oblation in the morning, one should smear the ground of the fire with cowdung all around.
1.5.14	Then one should prepare the fire-sticks, either from Khadira or Palasa wood.
1.5.7	The full moon is the highest attraction of the sun and moon, the new moon is the highest repulsion.

1.5.17	The grass cut at the root is for the Pitrs.
1.5.12	This is a separate chapter for this knowledge. One should study it or one should learn it from those who know it.
1.5.13	Now, on the day of fasting, having offered the morning oblation in the morning, one should smear the ground of the fire with cowdung all around.
1.5.14	Then one should prepare the fire-sticks, either from Khadira or Palasa wood.
1.5.18	If these are not available, then any grass except for reeds, grass, bamboo, reeds, and garlic.
1.5.19	Ghee, cooked rice, barley, rice-cake, ladle, spoon, and water.
1.5.20	And those that we will mention as alternatives.

1.5.21	That day should not be passed over.
1.6.1	Mānatantri said, "The offering of a man who does not eat the food of the day of fasting is indeed an offering to the fire.
1.6.2	He becomes powerless, greedy, and undesirable to people. His offspring become worse.

1.6.3	He who eats the food of the fasting day becomes powerful, not greedy, and desirable to people. His progeny becomes better.
1.6.13	Then, having offered the morning oblation in the morning, having circumambulated the fire from the front, having spread Darbha grass with the tips towards the east to the right side of the fire,
1.6.4	Therefore, one should wish that they eat on the day of fasting.

1.6.11	So also for one who has not established the sacred fire, the fast is observed.
1.6.12	And if the injunctions prescribe it.

1.6.20	Or he should say, "Salutations to Vishnu."
1.6.14	Standing in front of them, facing the opposite direction, he takes a blade of grass with the thumb and ring finger of his left hand from the Brahmasana, and sets it aside in the eighth direction, southwest, saying, "Parāvasu is set aside."
1.6.15	Having touched water, he then sits on the Brahmasana with the words, "May I sit in the abode of Vasu."
1.6.21	If one wishes to do both, the duties of a priest and those of a Brahman, then one should place the umbrella, the upper garment, the water pot, or the staff made of darbha grass on the Brahman's seat, return with it, and then do something else.

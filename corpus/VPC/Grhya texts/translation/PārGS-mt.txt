3.13.6	If he thinks that he is angry, then he should recite this mantra over him: "I take your speech from your mouth and place it in your heart. Wherever speech is hidden, I take it from there. Whatever I say is true. You should obey me."

3.10.49	Some people kill even animals for the sake of the departed.

3.13.7	This is the same as the subjugation.
3.14.1	Now, the mounting of a chariot.

3.15.16	He sprinkles and cleanses with the mantra, "You are the thunderbolt, salutations to you, may you not harm me."

3.15.23	Now, then, the removal of the non-removal is the sign of me, the discerning one. My tongue is sweet, my speech is sweet, much was heard by my ears. Do not be angry. The teaching of Brahma was heard by me. You are the foundation of Brahma. You are the Brahma-kośa. You are the Suni. You are the Shanti. You are the removal of the removal. Enter the Brahma-koša for me. I cover you with speech. I cover you. May the power of covering, holding, and uttering the sounds of the throat, palate, teeth, and lips be in me. May my limbs grow.

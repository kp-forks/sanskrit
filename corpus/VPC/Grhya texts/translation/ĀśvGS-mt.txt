1.1.4	He who has faith in the Veda, he who knows the Veda, to him salutations. There is indeed delight in the Veda. Seeing this, the sage said: "To the giver of wealth, to the giver of cattle, to the bright one, to the strong one, to the one who is sweet like ghee and honey, I speak." "There is indeed delight in my words, in ghee and honey. Let there be delight." This is what he says. "O Agni, we offer you oblation, prepared with our minds, with our verses. May they be your oxen, bulls, and heifers." "Those who study this lesson become your oxen, bulls and heifers." "He who recites with devotion." Indeed, the gods do not transgress the salutation.

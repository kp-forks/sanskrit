11.6.23	The Homa and the spreading of the grass on the right side have been mentioned.
11.6.24	The youngest one says, "I am offering this."
11.6.25	The son standing says, "This is the grass." He arranges it as he pleases.
11.6.26	"May your mind not be disturbed. Your body is Indra's." He instructs thus.
11.9.10	The earth is the ladle, unlimited, without end. Just as the earth is the ladle unlimited, without end, so is this ladle unlimited, without an end.
11.9.11	Having taken it up, he places it in the clarified butter and puts three lumps of dough together, saying, "This is for you, the spread out."
11.9.12	To the south for the wives, saying, "Here is yours, O wife."
11.9.13	This is for those who are hoping, for those who are not hoping, for women and men who are scattered and fallen, for whom we are givers and who live off us, to all of them with their wives, may there be inexhaustible prosperity. He scatters rice three times in the opposite direction.
11.7.5	Having sprinkled with water, saying, "A thousand streams, a hundred streams,"

11.9.17	He pours clarified butter uninterruptedly over the balls with the verse, “Those who are living and those who have gone before.”
11.9.18-20	Here the Fathers rejoice, each according to his share and light, and may they rain upon us. Here the wives rejoice, each according according to her share and light, may they rain upon us. Having looked round the fire that is between (the two fires), he goes three times round it, and then he goes away.
11.7.10	This is the way of the serpent. They make it so.
11.7.11	Having approached, they say, "Listen to the sin."
11.7.12	He places the upper-most branch, saying, "Listen to sin."
11.7.13	Some have prohibited it.
11.7.14	He raises the sin from the village area, saying, "The sin is hidden," with a stick of eight fingers' length made of unblemished reeds.
11.9.21	The fathers, as their share, as their light, have enjoyed the Soma.
11.9.22	The wives, as their share...
11.9.23	"The waters and Agni." Having sprinkled Agni with water,
11.7.15	Having sprinkled the Prāścīya (part of the altar), they break the pitchers.
11.7.16	When the people have assembled, they take up the Dhruva-sticks at the other end of the cremation ground.
11.7.17	Behind the fire, to the north, they recite the verse, "May Vivasvat, Indra, and Kratu bless me."

11.7.20	Having wiped the hands and feet with a black antelope skin,
11.7.21	The verse "These living beings are going upwards" is recited.
11.7.22	Having removed the three seven steps, from the cremation ground,

11.7.24	"The supreme death," he says, piercing the southern Kūḍī.
11.7.25	Having made seven forms of rivers and filled them with water,
11.7.26	"One mounts the boat of Savitar, the one who measures the earth," he says, mounting the boat with gold and barley.
11.7.27	"The one with the stone is flowing, rising, crossing, the friends," he says, crossing towards the north.
11.9.24	May they be satisfied with their sons and grandsons.
11.9.25	Having sipped water, I offer the Vīras to my great-great-grandfathers, the Vīras of my great-grandfathers, and the Vīras given by my grandfathers. The ancestors request the Vīras.
11.7.28	From the offering of the sacrificial grass, there is the offering of sugar etc.
11.7.29	It is similar to the Vaivasvata etc.
11.7.30	The offering of balls to the ancestors is similar after reaching home.

11.8.6	"He says, "Wash the mortar, pestle, winnowing basket, pot, and ladle. Bring the sacrificial grass and the water pot."
11.8.7	Wearing the sacrificial thread over the right shoulder, facing the northeast direction, he pours the sacrificial substances into the winnowing basket which is covered with a single strainer.
11.10.1	We invoke the mind with the Nārāśaṃsa hymn and the thoughts of the Pitrs. May the mind return to us for the sacrifice, for power, for life, to see the sun again. May the divine people, the Pitrs, give us back the mind. We may live the living community in your Soma vow, O Soma, bearing the mind in our bodies, we may live together those who are of the same mind, the living among the living, the ones belonging to me. May their prosperity be established in me. May there be a hundred years in this cattle-pen.
11.8.8	This is for Agni, the conveyor of oblations, to the Fathers who are seated on the earth. This is for Soma, the Father, to the Fathers connected with Soma, to the Fathers seated in the sky. This is for Yama, the Father, for the Fathers who are in heaven. He offers three oblations in succession.
11.10.2	If there is leftover rice in the pot, one should eat the heat of it and then give it to a brahmin.
11.10.3	If a brahmin is not available, one should drink it in water.

11.10.5	The middle portion of the food is given to one's wife who desires a son.
11.8.9	The Ulukhal is to be filled three times and pounded.
11.8.10	One should serve the oblation as one would serve the oblation.
11.8.11	For the oblation is indeed the Pitryajna.
11.8.12	They instruct the one who has performed the Prāṣa: "Wash the rice, place it in the Ulukhal, and pour the rice grains into it, pounding them with the Nekshana. Do not seize the head."
11.8.13	They call the seizing of the head a "head-grasping".
11.10.6	The Fathers have placed in thee the embryo, the young boy, the lotus-garlanded, as the man here is not. The bull, the tawny one, the most excellent, the wise, the Fathers have placed in him the embryo. May this man go to thee, the man from the man. May he be born for thy supremacy. Let him sing the Sama in the Soma.
11.10.7	If there is another second one, then it is the other one.
11.8.14	Having gone out with the external (rite), wearing the sacrificial thread, facing the south-east direction, he digs the furrow, a span in length, sloping towards the east.
11.8.15	Some say: sloping towards the west, a span in height.
11.8.16	He collects the dust towards the east and south, saying, "The Asuras and Rakshasas have been removed, those who sit with the ancestors."
11.10.8	The first portion is for the Śrotriya.
11.10.9	If his wife or slave runs away, he gives her the rice that has been scattered as the remnant of the oblation.
11.10.10	"He says, "Come near, do not go far. Thus food is the bond of life. By that I bind you to me."
11.10.11	Taking the water for rinsing and the kindling woods, he stands at the door of the house, saying, "May I not go away," and bearing strength.
11.8.17	Having washed the pot and the hands, he fills the pot with water, saying, "This is the vessel of your fathers."
11.8.18	Having gone inside, he offers it with curds or ghee, and then places the pot on the right side.
11.8.19	Taking two pieces of wood, he lights them, saying, "Oshanta."
11.8.20	He places one of the burning pieces of wood back.
11.8.21	Taking one, he says, "May you be here, O Dhanasani."
11.10.12	"Be pleased, do not be afraid! In this cow-pen, the cows, giving milk, are lying down. The pure ones, with pure vows, are living in the houses. We come to you for sustenance. The gods have given me sustenance, the men have given me sustenance. I have brought sustenance to the fathers. My houses are full of sustenance. The gods gave me milk, the men gave me milk. I have brought milk to the fathers. The houses are full of milk. The gods gave strength to me, the men gave strength to me. I have brought strength to the fathers. Houses are full of strength."
11.8.22	Having placed them in the sand, he places them near. "Those who are buried, those who are hungry, those who are true."
11.8.23	He collects the requisites.
11.8.24	The rinsing water, the sacrificial grass, the water pot, the vessel, the wooden sword, the clarified butter, the ladle, the cooked rice, the garments, the collyrium, the unguent.
11.8.25	Having collected here whatever is to be collected, he collects it.
11.10.13	He places the kindling-sticks with the formula, "This Agni is our overlord, this is our most bountiful. May we not be injured while approaching him. May he protect our progeny. May we prosper in him for a thousand years. May we prosper for him in our own house. We kindle this (Agni) for long life and good lustre. You are Agni, O Agni, we kindle you."
11.8.26	Therefore, having taken the sacrificial grass, having loosened the sacrificial thread, having gone to the eighth part towards the south, he should enter.
11.8.27	Having sprinkled the sacrificial grass with water, he spreads it with the verses, "The Fathers seated on the sacrificial grass are invoked by us. The Fathers Agni-swittas, the Fathers who are our fathers, the Fathers who were our fathers."
11.10.14	It is said to be the messenger, and he takes it back to Agni.
11.10.15	If all are offered, then this is for one who has the sacrificial fires.
11.10.16	It is also for one who does not have the sacrificial fires in domestic rites.
11.10.17	"This is done for me, this I am able to do, may my father know this."
11.8.28	The three beginning with āyāpana.
11.8.29	One should offer the three udapātras with the three verses beginning with "ud īrtam."
11.8.30	One who is wearing the sacred thread for the father and the sacred thread for sacrifice, should throw away the blazing torch three times in the opposite direction, after having gone around from both sides, with the verse "Those who are thieves."
11.8.31	Having sprinkled water,
11.10.18	The gods know him who sacrifices, the men know him who gives, the fathers know him who performs the śrāddhas.
12.1.1	One who is about to offer Madhuparka collects darbha grass.
12.1.2	Then he makes mats.
12.1.3	The first foot-washing is with one branch, the seat with two branches, and the Madhuparka with three branches.
12.1.4-5	He takes them up, saying, "For thee with truth, for thee with austerity, for thee with work."
11.9.1	Those who, though Asuras, are released from their forms and move according to their own will, them, O Agni, do thou drive away, far away. Let the blessings of our fathers be true. Svāhā! Having offered with the words "Svāhā! Svāhā!" he pours over the pot-cooked oblation.
11.9.2	He offers with the words "To Agni, the carrier of oblations."
11.9.3	The second one is offered as prescribed.
12.1.6	Then he releases (the Soma), saying, 'He who hates us and whom we hate, he is released.'
12.1.7	And he looks at the giver, saying, 'And this giver.'
12.1.8	Then he makes him drink water, saying, 'Water for the feet.'
12.1.9	Having recited the verse, 'Golden-coloured,' he first advances the right foot, saying, 'May I hold the Brahman and Tapas.'
11.9.4	To Yama, the father of the fathers, to the fathers, this is the third.
11.9.5	"What Agni has done for you," he says, sprinkling the rice grains.
11.9.6	"Having sprinkled the rice grains along with darbha grass, saying, "The sacrificial grass is joined,"
11.9.7	one who is wearing the sacrificial thread and the thread for the fathers, takes up the darbha grass."
12.1.10	"He says, 'The Kshatriya and the Vaishya are transferred to the right foot which is washed.
12.1.11	He says to the washed feet, 'These two feet, washed, have brought me the fame of a Brahman. The waters that wash the feet burn my enemies.
12.1.12	And he looks at the giver, saying, 'This is the giver.'
11.9.8	The sky is the pestle, unlimited, without end, as the sky is the pestles, unlimited, without an end, so is this pestle of the great one, unlimited, without and.
11.9.9	The atmosphere is the pestle unlimited, without end. As the atmosphere is the pestles unlimited, without anend, so is this pestel of the great one unlimited, without end.
12.1.13-16	Then he makes the guest sit on a seat with a spread, saying, "Sit on the seat with a spread." He sits facing away from him. Having placed his feet on the spread with the verse, "The earth is free from deer," he says, "He who hates us and whom we hate," and looks at the giver, saying, "And of this giver"
11.9.10	The earth is the ladle, unlimited, without end. Just as the earth is the ladle unlimited, without end, so is this ladle unlimited, without an end.
11.9.11	Having taken it up, he places it in the clarified butter and puts three lumps of dough together, saying, "This is for you, the spread out."
11.9.12	To the south for the wives, saying, "Here is yours, O wife."
12.1.17	Then he offers water, saying, "Arghya to you."
12.1.18	He responds with this verse: "You are the face of all foods, may I be the best among equals. May the waters be nectar, may they make me immortal. May many servants be ours. May there be cattle and prosperity in me. Om, earth, atmosphere, heaven, creation, Om."
11.9.13	This is for those who are hoping, for those who are not hoping, for women and men who are scattered and fallen, for whom we are givers and who live off us, to all of them with their wives, may there be inexhaustible prosperity. He scatters rice three times in the opposite direction.
12.1.19	He silently directs it to himself.
12.1.20	He touches the forehead with the words, "Thou art the lustre, thou art the nectar."
12.1.21	Then he makes him drink water with the words, “Drink water for rinsing the mouth.”
12.1.22	Having rinsed the mouth with the waters of life,
12.1.23	Then they offer him the Madhuparka, with the words, "The Madhuparka with two attendants is yours."
12.1.24	With two branches below and one above, covered.
12.1.25	"Honey, wind, and truth, for a long time." This is the recitation.

11.9.18-20	Here the Fathers rejoice, each according to his share and light, and may they rain upon us. Here the wives rejoice, each according according to her share and light, may they rain upon us. Having looked round the fire that is between (the two fires), he goes three times round it, and then he goes away.
11.9.21	The fathers, as their share, as their light, have enjoyed the Soma.
11.9.22	The wives, as their share...
11.9.23	"The waters and Agni." Having sprinkled Agni with water,

12.2.3	Having received it, he places it with the handle towards the east, facing the east.
12.2.4	"I place thee in the navel of the earth, on the lap of Aditi," having placed it on the ground.

12.2.15	It is auspicious, svāhā!, the tenth.
12.2.16	Om! The eleventh.
12.2.17	Silence! The twelfth.
11.9.24	May they be satisfied with their sons and grandsons.
11.9.25	Having sipped water, I offer the Vīras to my great-great-grandfathers, the Vīras of my great-grandfathers, and the Vīras given by my grandfathers. The ancestors request the Vīras.
12.2.18	Having eaten more than enough, he should give to a brahmin who is a student.
12.2.19	If a brahmin student is not available, he should give it to a non-brahmin.
12.2.20	Or this is a statement: "You brahmins drink the Soma, whatever you eat. Do not give leftovers to a non-brāhmaṇa. Let a non-Soma-drinker not drink Soma."
11.9.26	"Salutations to you, O Fathers!" he stands up.
11.9.27	Having thrown away the northern ladle, he says, "The food is eaten."
11.9.28	He sends away the remaining (food) with the words, "Go away."
11.9.29	One who wears the sacred thread for the Fathers, wearing the sacred thread for sacrifice, says, "I invite the mind which was with the Fathers."

12.3.9	Oil and ghee are the madhuparka of Sravan.
12.3.10	Oil and cake are the madhuparka of the Parivrajakas.
12.3.11	Thus this madhuparka is of nine kinds.
12.3.12	Then they tell him, "The cow is yours."
11.10.1	We invoke the mind with the Nārāśaṃsa hymn and the thoughts of the Pitrs. May the mind return to us for the sacrifice, for power, for life, to see the sun again. May the divine people, the Pitrs, give us back the mind. We may live the living community in your Soma vow, O Soma, bearing the mind in our bodies, we may live together those who are of the same mind, the living among the living, the ones belonging to me. May their prosperity be established in me. May there be a hundred years in this cattle-pen.
12.3.13	He addresses them with the following mantras: "You are the existence, you are the becoming, you are the food, you are the many breaths. Be the eldest, O name! Om, Bhuvar, Svar, Janat, Om."
11.10.2	If there is leftover rice in the pot, one should eat the heat of it and then give it to a brahmin.
11.10.3	If a brahmin is not available, one should drink it in water.

12.3.15	He recites the following verse while the cow is moving towards the stable:
12.3.16	"The cow does not become red, nor does she become a drinker of honey."
11.10.6	The Fathers have placed in thee the embryo, the young boy, the lotus-garlanded, as the man here is not. The bull, the tawny one, the most excellent, the wise, the Fathers have placed in him the embryo. May this man go to thee, the man from the man. May he be born for thy supremacy. Let him sing the Sama in the Soma.
11.10.7	If there is another second one, then it is the other one.
12.3.17	He should say, "We do not know the permission."
12.3.18	He gives the weapon, saying, "Do not harm him."
12.3.19	He instructs the performer, saying, "Remove my sin."
12.3.20	They should offer an oblation to Agni.
12.3.21	Or the Brahman himself may eat it, for that oblation is dedicated to that deity.
11.10.8	The first portion is for the Śrotriya.
11.10.9	If his wife or slave runs away, he gives her the rice that has been scattered as the remnant of the oblation.
11.10.10	"He says, "Come near, do not go far. Thus food is the bond of life. By that I bind you to me."
12.3.22	Then he gives him a bath, anoints him, and puts on him a garland.
12.3.23	Whatever is to be brought together here, he brings together.
12.3.24	Then the lay devotees and the probationary lay devotees announce, "We are lay devotees and probationary lay devotees."
12.3.25	He advises them, "May we be more numerous, and may those who are more numerous than us be more numerous, but may others not be more numerous than us."
11.10.11	Taking the water for rinsing and the kindling woods, he stands at the door of the house, saying, "May I not go away," and bearing strength.
12.3.26	And he looks at the giver of this, saying, "May he be a giver."
12.3.27	And when they have obtained food, they declare, "We are now eaters of food."
12.3.28	He addresses them, saying, "Let us be eaters of food, and may those who give us food be many, and may others also become many."
12.3.29	And he looks at the one who gives this, saying, "
11.10.12	"Be pleased, do not be afraid! In this cow-pen, the cows, giving milk, are lying down. The pure ones, with pure vows, are living in the houses. We come to you for sustenance. The gods have given me sustenance, the men have given me sustenance. I have brought sustenance to the fathers. My houses are full of sustenance. The gods gave me milk, the men gave me milk. I have brought milk to the fathers. The houses are full of milk. The gods gave strength to me, the men gave strength to me. I have brought strength to the fathers. Houses are full of strength."
12.3.30-32	When the food is brought, he offers with the verse, "Whatever desires we may have, we offer this oblation for you. May all that be accomplished for us. And may this oblation be accepted by you, svāhā." This is the rule for teachers, this is the rule for officiating priests, this is the combined rule, this is the marriage rule, this is for guests, this is the guest rule.
11.10.13	He places the kindling-sticks with the formula, "This Agni is our overlord, this is our most bountiful. May we not be injured while approaching him. May he protect our progeny. May we prosper in him for a thousand years. May we prosper for him in our own house. We kindle this (Agni) for long life and good lustre. You are Agni, O Agni, we kindle you."
13.1.1-12	Now the omens. In the rainy season. Among the Yakshas. In the face of a jackal. In a quarrelsome family. In an earthquake. In the eclipse of the sun. And of the moon. In the absence of the moon. In the terrible Samā. In the fear of a comet. Among the Brahmins who are armed.
11.10.14	It is said to be the messenger, and he takes it back to Agni.
11.10.15	If all are offered, then this is for one who has the sacrificial fires.
11.10.16	It is also for one who does not have the sacrificial fires in domestic rites.
11.10.17	"This is done for me, this I am able to do, may my father know this."
13.1.13	When the gods dance, weep, laugh, and sing,
13.1.14	In the union of the bull and the cow,
13.1.15	In the connection of the string and the body,
13.1.16	In the conjunction of fire,
13.1.17	In the cow with a calf of Yama,
13.1.18	In the mare and the donkey, and in the human,
13.1.19	Where cows give milk of blood,
13.1.20	The bull drinks the cow.
11.10.18	The gods know him who sacrifices, the men know him who gives, the fathers know him who performs the śrāddhas.
12.1.1	One who is about to offer Madhuparka collects darbha grass.
12.1.2	Then he makes mats.
12.1.3	The first foot-washing is with one branch, the seat with two branches, and the Madhuparka with three branches.
12.1.4-5	He takes them up, saying, "For thee with truth, for thee with austerity, for thee with work."
13.1.21	When a cow is suckling her calf.
13.1.22	In the sky.
13.1.23	In the conduct of ants.

12.1.7	And he looks at the giver, saying, 'And this giver.'
12.1.8	Then he makes him drink water, saying, 'Water for the feet.'
12.1.9	Having recited the verse, 'Golden-coloured,' he first advances the right foot, saying, 'May I hold the Brahman and Tapas.'
13.1.34	He fumigates the seven sages in the smoke-banner.
13.1.35	In the stars, in the sun.
13.1.36	It falls on the face of meat.
13.1.37	In the absence of fire, in the light.
13.1.38	It breathes in the fire.
13.1.39	It drips in ghee, oil, and honey.
13.1.40	It burns the house in the village fire.
13.1.41	And in the guest fire.
13.1.42	It bursts in the bamboo.
12.1.10	"He says, 'The Kshatriya and the Vaishya are transferred to the right foot which is washed.
12.1.11	He says to the washed feet, 'These two feet, washed, have brought me the fame of a Brahman. The waters that wash the feet burn my enemies.
12.1.12	And he looks at the giver, saying, 'This is the giver.'
13.1.43	In the rainy season, when the clouds are thundering, when the sun is shining, and when the grains are ripe.
13.2.1	Then, when these rains rain there, ghee, meat, honey, gold, and other terrible rains rain, then that family, village, or country is destroyed.
13.2.2	There, the king, the lord of the earth, should desire a learned Brahman.
12.1.13-16	Then he makes the guest sit on a seat with a spread, saying, "Sit on the seat with a spread." He sits facing away from him. Having placed his feet on the spread with the verse, "The earth is free from deer," he says, "He who hates us and whom we hate," and looks at the giver, saying, "And of this giver"
13.2.3	He who knows this is indeed the knower of Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras.
13.2.4	These indeed are the pacifiers and protectors of all this, namely Bhṛgu and Angiras.
13.2.5	He said, "Prepare it."
13.2.6	They prepare it - a large, pure garment, pure ghee, calm herbs, and a new water pot.
12.1.17	Then he offers water, saying, "Arghya to you."
12.1.18	He responds with this verse: "You are the face of all foods, may I be the best among equals. May the waters be nectar, may they make me immortal. May many servants be ours. May there be cattle and prosperity in me. Om, earth, atmosphere, heaven, creation, Om."
13.2.7	The three occasions for performing a ritual are the full moon, the new moon, and an auspicious constellation.
13.2.8	If one performs it only when in distress, then it is acceptable.
13.2.9	One who has bathed, put on fresh clothes, and is fragrant, observes the vow, and fasts for one night, three nights, six nights, or twelve nights in preparation for the ritual.
13.2.10	When the sun has set on the twelfth day, he should kindle the fire again in the place where it had fallen.
13.2.11	Having encircled, sprinkled, and spread the sacrificial grass, having placed the water vessel, having prepared the clarified butter with the Paricaraṇa rite,
13.2.12	having offered the regular oblations before, and the two portions of clarified butter,
13.2.13	then he offers:
12.1.19	He silently directs it to himself.
12.1.20	He touches the forehead with the words, "Thou art the lustre, thou art the nectar."
12.1.21	Then he makes him drink water with the words, “Drink water for rinsing the mouth.”
12.1.22	Having rinsed the mouth with the waters of life,
12.1.23	Then they offer him the Madhuparka, with the words, "The Madhuparka with two attendants is yours."
12.1.24	With two branches below and one above, covered.
12.1.25	"Honey, wind, and truth, for a long time." This is the recitation.
12.1.26	Similarly, the recitation of the opponent.
13.2.14	May the streams of ghee that fall here, cooked meat, honey and gold follow the hater. May there be many showers of water, showers of rain for me. May the showers of blood, showers of honey and dust, or whatever terrible and undesirable rain there is, follow the hater. Let all of them go away, turning back. Having offered to Agni with "Svāhā",
12.2.1	May the bees hum sweetly, may the rivers flow sweetly, may the cows be sweet to us. May the night and the dawn be sweet, may the earth be sweet. May the plants be sweet to us, may the trees be sweet. May Surya be sweet to us; may our father, the sky, be sweet.
13.2.15	The divine Gandharva should offer with the names of his mother.
13.2.16	A brahmin should give a good bull to the performer.
13.2.17	A vaishya should give a plough, a king should give a horse, a local king should give a village.
13.2.18	This is the atonement there.
12.2.2	"He waits for thee with the eye of the sun."
12.2.3	Having received it, he places it with the handle towards the east, facing the east.
12.2.4	"I place thee in the navel of the earth, on the lap of Aditi," having placed it on the ground.
13.3.1	Now, where these Yakshas are seen, it is like a monkey, a dog, a crow, or a human form. It is indeed suspected in this way.
13.3.2	One should offer there.
12.2.5	Having moved the two fingers clockwise, he eats, holding them with the ring finger and thumb.
12.2.6	"Om, Bhūr, the most excellent of Savitar, Bhūr, Svāhā, is the first."
12.2.7	"Bhargho, the deity, we meditate on, Bhuvah, Svāhā is the second."
12.2.8	"The one who inspires our minds, Suvah, Svāha is the third."
13.3.3	If the monkey, the dog, or the crow flies over this kingdom, O Jātavedas, if it flies over the protector of men, if it flies towards the enemy, may all of them follow it. Those who go away may return. Having offered to Agni with "Svāhā,"
13.3.4	One should offer with the names of the mother, "Divine Gandharva."
13.3.5	That is the atonement there.
13.4.1	Now, there were two frogs named Gomāyu. When they spoke, they thought, "He is speaking to me, he is speaking to me." It is indeed a matter of doubt.
13.4.2	One should offer there.
12.2.9	We are wise in the god's wisdom, svāhā, is the fourth.
12.2.10	The god's food is growing, svāhā is the fifth.
12.2.11	It gives, svāhā. The sixth.
12.2.12	It grows, svāhā; the seventh.
12.2.13	It is great, svāhā: the eighth.
12.2.14	It is that, svāhā! The ninth.
12.2.15	It is auspicious, svāhā!, the tenth.
12.2.16	Om! The eleventh.
12.2.17	Silence! The twelfth.
13.4.3	When the jackals bark, Jātavedas, with another voice, he roars. These two Sāmans, Rathantara and Bṛhat, have sung to the hater. With Rathantara I pacify thee with Bṛhat; with Bṛhat I pacify thee, with Rathantara. Indra and Agni, having increased thee with Brahman, may they make thee the most long-lived. Having offered to Indra and Agni with Svāhā.
12.2.18	Having eaten more than enough, he should give to a brahmin who is a student.
12.2.19	If a brahmin student is not available, he should give it to a non-brahmin.
12.2.20	Or this is a statement: "You brahmins drink the Soma, whatever you eat. Do not give leftovers to a non-brāhmaṇa. Let a non-Soma-drinker not drink Soma."
13.4.4	He should offer with the names of his mother, "O divine Gandharva."
13.4.5	That is the atonement there.
13.5.1	Now when a family quarrels there, they say it is seized by Nirriti.
13.5.2	There he should offer:
13.5.3	"From afar, from hostility." Two verses.
12.3.1	Dadhi and madhu are the Madhuparka of Brahma.
12.3.2	Payasa is the Madhuparka for Indra.
12.3.3	Madhu and ghee are the Madhuparka of Soma.
12.3.4	Curd and ghee are the madhuparka of Agni.
12.3.5	Milk and ghee are the Sarasvata Madhuparka.
12.3.6	Wine and ghee are the Mauṣala Madhuparka.
13.5.4	"O Agni, may there be no harm and no censure. You are the truth. You are the one who is not harmed. You are made by the mind. Being unharmed, I offer the oblation. Grant us healing. Svāhā." Having offered into the fire,
13.5.5	one should offer these oblations there itself.
13.5.6	I have placed the Agni-fire, the eater of raw flesh, in the distance for your life. I have placed the boundary. Indra and Agni have increased you with the Brahman. May they make you the most youthful. Having offered with "To Indra and Agni, svāhā,"
13.5.7	One should offer with this verse: "May Nirriti depart."
12.3.7	Now this is of two kinds, at the Sautrāmaṇī and at the Rājasūya.
12.3.8	Water and ghee are the Madhuparka of Varuna.
12.3.9	Oil and ghee are the madhuparka of Sravan.
12.3.10	Oil and cake are the madhuparka of the Parivrajakas.
12.3.11	Thus this madhuparka is of nine kinds.
12.3.12	Then they tell him, "The cow is yours."
12.3.13	He addresses them with the following mantras: "You are the existence, you are the becoming, you are the food, you are the many breaths. Be the eldest, O name! Om, Bhuvar, Svar, Janat, Om."
12.3.14	The mother of the Adityas, the sister of the Vasus, the sister of Rudras, the navel of immortality, she speaks to us for the healer, the people. Do not kill Aditi, the non-killer, with the cow. "He says, "The cow eats grass."
12.3.15	He recites the following verse while the cow is moving towards the stable:
12.3.16	"The cow does not become red, nor does she become a drinker of honey."
13.5.8	May Nirriti depart from here, may she not have anything here. May the hundred Death-snares, the snares of the evil one, be cast aside. The hundred snares, the hundred deaths, for the killing of the mortal, we cast them all aside by the power of the sacrifice. May the hundred deaths, the evil ones, go away from here. We repel their darkness. We place the breath and the light. The hundred snaires of Varuna, the thousand snaires of Varun, the great snaires of Varupa, which are spread out, may Varuna, Soma, Indra, the Maruts, the heavenly ones, release us from them. The Brahman shines forth, the Brahman is in the sky, the Brahman is above, the Brahman is below. The Brahman is the witness of good deeds. The Brahman releases us from sin and darkness.
13.5.9	The offering is the same as that of a bull.
13.6.1	One should offer oblations at the place where there is an earthquake.
12.3.17	He should say, "We do not know the permission."
12.3.18	He gives the weapon, saying, "Do not harm him."
12.3.19	He instructs the performer, saying, "Remove my sin."
12.3.20	They should offer an oblation to Agni.
12.3.21	Or the Brahman himself may eat it, for that oblation is dedicated to that deity.
12.3.22	Then he gives him a bath, anoints him, and puts on him a garland.
12.3.23	Whatever is to be brought together here, he brings together.
12.3.24	Then the lay devotees and the probationary lay devotees announce, "We are lay devotees and probationary lay devotees."
12.3.25	He advises them, "May we be more numerous, and may those who are more numerous than us be more numerous, but may others not be more numerous than us."
13.6.2	The sky is not shaken, the atmosphere is not shaken, earth is not shaken, these directions are not shaken, this one is not shaken, he is firm, he is the protector, I stand in the firm kingdom, the conqueror. As the sun shines in the sky, as the atmosphere is covered by the wind, as Agni entered the earth, so this one is firm, not shaken, the conqueror. As the god shines in the sky thundering, as rain falls for the one who desires rain, as water entered the earth, thus this one is firm and not shaken, the conquerer. As the rivers flow into the ocean, as day and night flow without negligence, thus may all the classes of people come to me with a united mind for my welfare and without negligence. May the goddess, together with the deities, be firm, strong, and unshakable for me. May she remove all evil from us. May she penetrate my enemies and adversaries. Having offered the oblation, one says, "Svāhā to Earth!"
12.3.26	And he looks at the giver of this, saying, "May he be a giver."
12.3.27	And when they have obtained food, they declare, "We are now eaters of food."
12.3.28	He addresses them, saying, "Let us be eaters of food, and may those who give us food be many, and may others also become many."
12.3.29	And he looks at the one who gives this, saying, "
13.6.3	One should offer with this Anuvāka: "I have brought you, O firm heaven, the truth, the great."
13.6.4	This is the atonement there.
13.7.1	One should offer when the sun is obscured by darkness.
12.3.30-32	When the food is brought, he offers with the verse, "Whatever desires we may have, we offer this oblation for you. May all that be accomplished for us. And may this oblation be accepted by you, svāhā." This is the rule for teachers, this is the rule for officiating priests, this is the combined rule, this is the marriage rule, this is for guests, this is the guest rule.
13.7.2	The divine, variegated, arranging the seasons, the fierce one, turning the seasons, rises. May that Aditya, the remover of darkness, come forth. The waters flow through these worlds, united with the plants. May Indra and Agni protect you with those (waters). With truth and truthful speech, may you destroy all darkness. Having offered to Aditya with "Svāhā,"
13.7.3	He should offer oblations with the verse, "He who is capable of withstanding the poison."
13.7.4	One should attend with red (flowers).
13.7.5	That is the atonement there.
13.8.1	Then where the moon rises, one should offer oblations there.
13.1.1-12	Now the omens. In the rainy season. Among the Yakshas. In the face of a jackal. In a quarrelsome family. In an earthquake. In the eclipse of the sun. And of the moon. In the absence of the moon. In the terrible Samā. In the fear of a comet. Among the Brahmins who are armed.
13.1.13	When the gods dance, weep, laugh, and sing,
13.1.14	In the union of the bull and the cow,
13.1.15	In the connection of the string and the body,
13.1.16	In the conjunction of fire,
13.1.17	In the cow with a calf of Yama,
13.1.18	In the mare and the donkey, and in the human,
13.1.19	Where cows give milk of blood,
13.1.20	The bull drinks the cow.
13.1.21	When a cow is suckling her calf.
13.1.22	In the sky.
13.1.23	In the conduct of ants.

13.1.30	In the offered oblations.
13.1.31	In the prasavya (oblations) that are turned back.
13.1.32	When the sacrificial post grows.
13.1.33	In the meteor.
13.10.2	The one who comes with the same (food) shakes off the Prajapati-born (beings). We consecrate you, the one whom the gods know as the one who satisfies. The mother of the hunter, golden-bellied, tawny, we consecrate you. Whatever is terrible in you, whatever poison is in you, we place that in the enemies, in the one who is yonder. One should say this.
13.1.34	He fumigates the seven sages in the smoke-banner.
13.1.35	In the stars, in the sun.
13.1.36	It falls on the face of meat.
13.1.37	In the absence of fire, in the light.
13.1.38	It breathes in the fire.
13.1.39	It drips in ghee, oil, and honey.
13.1.40	It burns the house in the village fire.
13.1.41	And in the guest fire.

13.10.3	Having offered with the verse, "May Śiva be with us for peace, for long life, for prosperity, and for good fortune."
13.10.4	One should offer with this verse, "O Agni, may you be with us."
13.10.5	This is the atonement there.
13.11.1	Then where there are these stars, one should offer there.
13.1.43	In the rainy season, when the clouds are thundering, when the sun is shining, and when the grains are ripe.
13.2.1	Then, when these rains rain there, ghee, meat, honey, gold, and other terrible rains rain, then that family, village, or country is destroyed.
13.2.2	There, the king, the lord of the earth, should desire a learned Brahman.
13.11.2	May the Revatī stars, bright, shining, and shining forth, enter the smoke of the oblation. May the waters enter the earth beyond. May the waters move through these worlds. Having offered with "Svāhā to the waters,"

Like the Kargala (birds) running to the water, like the fierce (birds) running (to the water), may the women run like the Kargala birds. May they run by the good path. The two of you are to be praised. You are to be praised like the best horses. I have sung the praise of the women who are resting, the five-rayed one. The woman makes the thread like a string. Indra, your garment is faultless, and also the upper one.

13.5.8	May Nirriti depart from here, may she not have anything here. May the hundred Death-snares, the snares of the evil one, be cast aside. The hundred snares, the hundred deaths, for the killing of the mortal, we cast them all aside by the power of the sacrifice. May the hundred deaths, the evil ones, go away from here. We repel their darkness. We place the breath and the light. The hundred snaires of Varuna, the thousand snaires of Varun, the great snaires of Varupa, which are spread out, may Varuna, Soma, Indra, the Maruts, the heavenly ones, release us from them.

As the sun shines in the sky, as the atmosphere is covered by the wind, as Agni entered the earth, so this one is firm, not shaken, the conqueror.

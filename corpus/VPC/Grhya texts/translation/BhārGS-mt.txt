1.10.10	He gives a cow as a gift to his teacher.
1.10.11	Before the rite of giving the cow, he does not take a bath or apply fragrance.

1.10.3	Three or unlimited (begging bowls) are begged.
1.10.4	For three nights he lies down below without salt and without food.
1.10.5	Then on the fourth day they make him generate wisdom.
1.11.1-5	There are four kinds of marriage: wealth, beauty, wisdom and kinship. If one cannot afford all of them, one should give up wealth and then beauty. There is a dispute between wisdom and kinship. Some say that one should give up kinship. Because one cannot live with a person who lacks wisdom.
1.10.6	Where there is a Palasha tree with one root, having surrounded it and washed it, he anoints it with ghee, reciting: "May you make me famous, as you are famous.

1.11.11	He should bring four clods of earth: one from the sacrificial altar, one from cowdung, one from the river bank, and one from a cremation ground.
1.11.12	He should say, "Take one of these."
1.11.13	If she takes the clod from the sacrificial altar it means she will give birth to a teacher or a sacrificer.
1.11.14	If she takes a clod from cowdung, it means she will have many cattle.

2.12.3	He puts down three balls of food, with the right hand turned away, saying, "This is thy food, O father, sweet, from Sarasvati. As great as Agni and the earth are, so great is his measure.

2.13.1	This is the sweet food of your great-great-grandfather. The extent of Sarasvati is the extent of the sun and heaven. I give him this extent as his share. As the sun is imperishable and uninterrupted, so may my great-great-grandfathers be imperishable and uninterrupted. May you have prosperity. May you live with those whom you have here and those who are here for you. The fathers, as their share, may they give to you. Having said this, he turns away.
2.13.2	He attends to the heat which has been withdrawn.
2.13.3	He turns back from the withdrawn heat or from the non-withdrawn heat.
2.13.4	The fathers of Soma have not been satisfied. Having turned back, he stands with salutations: "Salutations to you, O fathers, for the life-giving. Having reached the end, he says: "May I be the most prosperous among them."

2.13.5	Having washed the vessel with water and filled it, he sprinkles it three times. The waters, flowing towards the east, are sweet, nourishing the sons and grandsons. The waters, the goddesses, nourish both. Carrying nourishment, milk, water, ghee, milk, the flowing stream, the rivers, flowing with water, shining, with good fords, may they flow in that world. May they flow with nourishment, with milk, with honey, with ghee. May they be satisfied with nectar. May they be pleased with me. Having come without waiting, he says: "May they be satisfied with honey and ghee. May they satisfy my ancestors."
2.12.2	Having sprinkled (the water), he places a handful of Darbha grass on the right side and offers three water libations in the direction of the right, saying, "May this one be satisfied with the water. May this one be satisfied. May this one, the father, be satisfied. May the grandfather be satisfied. May great-grandfather be satisfied." Here the names are mentioned.
2.14.1	Then he touches the food: "The earth is thy vessel, the sky thy cover. I offer thee in the mouth of Brahman, I offer thee in thy breath and out-breath of Brahmanas. Thou art imperishable. May these be thy best friends in the other world, in the yonder world. The earth is equal to that, Agni is its overseer. Thy glory is the earth. The sky is thy vessel, etc." "The sky is equal to that. The sun is its overseer, thy glory is the Yajus."
2.14.2	Having fed the Brahmanas, having taken the water-pot which was given to him, having gone to the south-east corner, he makes it flow with the water-pot given to him, saying, "O Fathers, Soma, come hither by the deep and ancient paths. Then come again in the month to eat our oblation, O ye of good progeny, O ye of heroic sons." Having gathered from all sides, he eats the remainder, saying, "May this food be filled and unfilled. May it be immortal with the gods for us. I offer thee, O life, immortal, svāhā."
2.12.3	He puts down three balls of food, with the right hand turned away, saying, "This is thy food, O father, sweet, from Sarasvati. As great as Agni and the earth are, so great is his measure. I give him this measure, as great as the imperishable Agni is, so great is my father, imperishable, with thee as imperishable. Do thou enjoy the imperishable with those who are here with thee and those who follow thee." This is thy food, o grandfather, sweet, from Saravasti.

2.15.8	Having cooked it in the Upavasana (oblation), he offers it in the Upavāsana (oblation). The stones of the mortar made a sound, making the oblation. May we be prosperous, having many sons and heroes, lords of wealth. Svāhā to the Pitṛs. This is the oblation with four corners, full of ghee, with milk, full of wealth, full of nourishment. May the Pitṛs accept it, united. May this be well-offered, well-offered for me. Svāhā. O Jātavedas, carry the oblation to the Pitṛ-s, wherever you know them to be hidden far away. May the streams of oblations flow to them. May their wishes be fulfilled. Svāhā.

2.16.4	The Fathers, having come together, may they enjoy the nourishing, the milk-giving (Soma).

Having sprinkled her, having placed her near the fire, with her head towards the west, with her feet towards the south, they make her known.

2.18.4	This day is for those who have bathed. He shines with his splendor.
2.18.5	Therefore one should not bathe on this day.
2.16.4	The Fathers, having come together, may they enjoy the nourishing, the milk-giving (Soma).

2.19.3	He recites over the knife being placed, "Whatever is the three-year life of the sages, of Jamadagni and Kashyapa, whatever is the three-years life of the gods, may that be my three-years life."
2.19.4	When you shave with the razor, O Maruts, with your excellent power, with your power of growth, may you not deprive me of life.

Having taken it, he hides it near the tree, saying, "I am hiding the enemy of so-and-so, the son of so-andso, above the enemies." Having taken it, he conceals it near the tree. Then the waters gathered, the hot and the cold.

2.18.2	Now the stars are Tishya, Uttara Phalguni, Hasta, Chitra, Swati, and Vishakha.
2.18.3	When one of these rises before the sun, one should go to a village.
2.18.4	This day is for those who have bathed. He shines with his splendor.
2.18.5	Therefore one should not bathe on this day.

2.19.3	He recites over the knife being placed, "Whatever is the three-year life of the sages, of Jamadagni and Kashyapa, whatever is the three-years life of the gods, may that be my three-years life."
2.21.1	Having sat down facing the east, beyond the fire, he releases the gem along with the noose, the gem of Bādarā.
2.21.2	Having placed it in the water pot, he sprinkles it clockwise, saying, "O medicinal herb, the one who saves, the one who endures, the one who is enduring, may it make me golden-colored and brahminical-colored." Having lifted it up, he releases it by himself, saying, "You are a noose."
2.21.3	He places it on the chest, saying, "May my chest not be injured. May I be safe from harm. May I have long life, a hundred years." With his hand he places the Badara gem on the chest, "You are the energy."
2.19.4	When you shave with the razor, O Maruts, with your excellent power, with your power of growth, may you not deprive me of life.
2.19.5	Having shaved the beard, he shaves the armpits, then the hair according to the order of the limbs. Thereafter, he shaves in the same order.
2.21.4	The gem of the Brāhmaṇa is the sun, of the Vaiśya the hair, of the king the ass’s tail. The gem of the Brahmana is the sun, the gem of the Vaishya is the hair, the gem of a king is the ass's tail. The fig-tree is the gem of anyone. This is the verse on wearing gems:
2.21.5	Having placed the unassailable one within, wear it for your life.
2.19.6-8	Having sat down in the rear part of the village, having loosened the girdle, he gives it to the sacrificer for the rite. Having taken it, he hides it near the tree, saying, "I am hiding the enemy of so-and-so, the son of so-andso, above the enemies." Having taken it, he conceals it near the tree. Then the waters gathered, the hot and the cold.
2.19.9	It is understood that it brings the cold and hot (water) by excluding the divine and human (water).
2.19.10	He sprinkles with mixed waters, with the three verses, "The waters are firm, the waters are mighty," and with the four verses, "The golden-coloured, the pure, the shining ones," and with the Anuvaka, "Pavamana, the golden-coloured one."
2.19.11	Having heated with the Snāniya (water),
2.20.1	He washes his teeth, saying, "May the king Soma come here; may he enter me with food and wealth. May I be long-lived and have food."
2.20.2	When about to anoint himself with all-fragrant oil, he sprinkles himself, saying, "Salutations to Shaka and Janjha. Salutations to those goddesses who are the grabbers."
2.21.6	Having placed the ladle in the fire, he offers a portion of clarified butter with the verse, "May this gold, the giver of life, lustre, good progeny, prosperity, and abundance, enter me for victory. Svāhā!" "The horse is high, the conqueror of enemies, the destroyer of fear, the conqueror of wealth. All the prosperous and prosperous things are concentrated in this gold. Svāhā! The golden one, like the father of the dog, is the one whose name is taken first. May that one, the golden-coloured one, be dear to men. Svāhā." "May it be dear to the gods, may it be dear to Brahmins, may it be loved by all Shudras, may it be beloved by kings. Svāhā. May we be united with the one who is dear to the king and the one who is loved by the people, and with the prosperity that is at the door of our house. Svāhā.
2.22.1	Having taken it out and washed it, he should put it on the right side first, saying, "For longevity and radiance."
2.22.2	This should be known for tying a gem or earring.
2.20.3	Then he should anoint (himself) with the words, "May the lustre that is in the Apsarases and Gandharvas, the divine and human fragrance, enter me here."
2.20.4	Having collected sandalwood, one should anoint oneself with the words, "May the lustre that..."
2.20.5	Then he should put on a new inner garment, saying, "You are life" and "You are old age."
2.22.3	Then he releases the garland, saying, "O auspicious one, ascend my head, adorning my face. For my face is adorned by you. Make it more auspicious. The one that Jamadagni brought for faith, for desire, for others, I release that one with Bhaga and radiance."
2.22.4	Then he anoints himself with the Trikakud eye-salve, which has been produced on the Himālaya mountain, and is of the lustre of the mountain.
2.22.5	He looks into the mirror, saying, "Whatever lustre of mine has fallen down, seeing myself, I take it back again with Bhaga."
2.22.6	He remains silent until the rising of the stars.
2.20.6	Having put on the sacrificial thread, having sipped water, having offered the oblations of Jaya and Abhyatana, he offers these oblations: "May the consecration, austerity, the mother of the mind, Matrshvan, Brihaspati be the source of this speech. May the Vedas and knowledge be in me. May the Charavas, Agni and Soma, bestow fame upon us. Agni shines by which, Soma shines by which, Surya shines by which, Viraj shines by which, may I be here as the sole one, shining all around by that."
2.21.1	Having sat down facing the east, beyond the fire, he releases the gem along with the noose, the gem of Bādarā.
2.21.2	Having placed it in the water pot, he sprinkles it clockwise, saying, "O medicinal herb, the one who saves, the one who endures, the one who is enduring, may it make me golden-colored and brahminical-colored." Having lifted it up, he releases it by himself, saying, "You are a noose."
2.22.7	When the stars have risen, he puts on his sandals, saying, "Thou art the sky" (to the right one), "Thou art the earth" (to the left one).
2.22.8	Having put them on, he recites, "Ye are established, ye are the deities; do not burn me."
2.22.9	He takes up the staff, saying, "I am for the world, for the Veda, for the destruction of those who hate us, for the destruction (of our) enemies, for the destruction, of those who breathe, for the destruction (?) of creeping things, for the destruction(?) of elephants."
2.21.3	He places it on the chest, saying, "May my chest not be injured. May I be safe from harm. May I have long life, a hundred years." With his hand he places the Badara gem on the chest, "You are the energy."
2.22.10	He takes up the umbrella, saying, "Thou art the refuge of Prajapati, the canopy of Brahman."
2.22.11	Having gone out, he looks towards the directions, saying, "The six goddesses, the Urvis, make us vast."
2.22.12	He looks towards the moon, saying, "O Soma, the king, may we not be deprived of thee by the hater."
2.22.13	One says, "He speaks with him in whose favour he has spoken, and goes as he pleases."
2.21.4	The gem of the Brāhmaṇa is the sun, of the Vaiśya the hair, of the king the ass’s tail. The gem of the Brahmana is the sun, the gem of the Vaishya is the hair, the gem of a king is the ass's tail. The fig-tree is the gem of anyone. This is the verse on wearing gems:
2.21.5	Having placed the unassailable one within, wear it for your life.
2.22.14	Then, having bathed silently in the sacred place, he comes out and silently places a Palāśa twig.
2.22.15	He does not have sexual intercourse for a year, or for twelve nights, or for three nights. All the stages (of life) are (to be followed).
2.23.1	Then, desiring to offer a fee, he informs about the fee: "I desire to offer."
2.23.2	He says, "Do it."
2.23.3	Having brought curd, he brings honey.
2.23.4	Having brought the younger, he places him on the elder.
2.23.5	The elder is honoured with a seat.
2.23.6	He follows with water for washing the feet, water for offering, water for sipping, and the Madhuparka.
2.23.7	Then he informs him, "This is your seat."
2.23.8	The king or the Brahman says to him, "May the teacher's seat be yours; may your wife not be a woman."
2.23.9	The leader of the country or the commander-in-chief says to him, “May the seat of authority be yours; may not your wife be a woman.”
2.23.10	Then he is informed, "This is water for washing the feet."
2.21.6	Having placed the ladle in the fire, he offers a portion of clarified butter with the verse, "May this gold, the giver of life, lustre, good progeny, prosperity, and abundance, enter me for victory. Svāhā!" "The horse is high, the conqueror of enemies, the destroyer of fear, the conqueror of wealth. All the prosperous and prosperous things are concentrated in this gold. Svāhā! The golden one, like the father of the dog, is the one whose name is taken first. May that one, the golden-coloured one, be dear to men. Svāhā." "May it be dear to the gods, may it be dear to Brahmins, may it be loved by all Shudras, may it be beloved by kings. Svāhā. May we be united with the one who is dear to the king and the one who is loved by the people, and with the prosperity that is at the door of our house. Svāhā.
2.22.1	Having taken it out and washed it, he should put it on the right side first, saying, "For longevity and radiance."
2.22.2	This should be known for tying a gem or earring.
2.23.11	He recites the following verse: "May the waters, the foot-washing waters, destroy my enemies. May there be Brahmic lustre in this family. May there be greatness in me, fame in me, power and valour in me. May it come to me. May it be united with fame, lustre, milk and brilliance. May it be the beloved of the people, the lord of cattle."
2.23.12	Having taken the left foot, he should take the right one. The king, the chief, or the commander-in-chief should do this.
2.24.1	Then he announces, "This is your welcome."
2.22.3	Then he releases the garland, saying, "O auspicious one, ascend my head, adorning my face. For my face is adorned by you. Make it more auspicious. The one that Jamadagni brought for faith, for desire, for others, I release that one with Bhaga and radiance."
2.22.4	Then he anoints himself with the Trikakud eye-salve, which has been produced on the Himālaya mountain, and is of the lustre of the mountain.
2.22.5	He looks into the mirror, saying, "Whatever lustre of mine has fallen down, seeing myself, I take it back again with Bhaga."
2.22.6	He remains silent until the rising of the stars.
2.24.2	Having thus consulted with the same (verse), he says, "Thou art the milking of Viraj, thou art the milking of the milking of Viraja. The milking is in me for the sake of the milking of the Viraj." Having received it, he takes it away, saying, "I send you to the ocean. Go to your own place. May I be without a break in progeny. May my milk not be spilled."
2.24.3	Then he informs him, "This is your water for rinsing the mouth."
2.24.4	"You are the covering of nectar."
2.24.5	Having sipped water, he informs him of the Madhuparka.
2.24.6	He responds with the verse: "Whatever is the supreme form of honey, may I be the supreme eater of honey, with that supreme form of honey."
2.22.7	When the stars have risen, he puts on his sandals, saying, "Thou art the sky" (to the right one), "Thou art the earth" (to the left one).
2.22.8	Having put them on, he recites, "Ye are established, ye are the deities; do not burn me."
2.22.9	He takes up the staff, saying, "I am for the world, for the Veda, for the destruction of those who hate us, for the destruction (of our) enemies, for the destruction, of those who breathe, for the destruction (?) of creeping things, for the destruction(?) of elephants."
2.24.7	Having accepted, he eats, saying, "You are fame, you are the fame of the three Vedas. You are the radiance of Brahman. Make me dear to the people, the lord of cattle."
2.24.8	Having sipped water three times, saying "Earth, Bhuva, Suva," he then gives it to the guest or eats it all himself.
2.24.9	Then he informs him, "This is your sipping water."
2.22.10	He takes up the umbrella, saying, "Thou art the refuge of Prajapati, the canopy of Brahman."
2.22.11	Having gone out, he looks towards the directions, saying, "The six goddesses, the Urvis, make us vast."
2.22.12	He looks towards the moon, saying, "O Soma, the king, may we not be deprived of thee by the hater."
2.22.13	One says, "He speaks with him in whose favour he has spoken, and goes as he pleases."
2.24.10	"You are the cover of immortality."
2.24.11	Having sipped water, he informs him, "It is a cow."
2.24.12	He addresses her with the verse, "This is a cow, removing sin. Remove sin, remove the sin of me and this one. Remove the one who hates us. Destroy the one who hates me."
2.25.1	Then, having prepared food for him, he informs him with the verse, "
2.22.14	Then, having bathed silently in the sacred place, he comes out and silently places a Palāśa twig.
2.22.15	He does not have sexual intercourse for a year, or for twelve nights, or for three nights. All the stages (of life) are (to be followed).
2.23.1	Then, desiring to offer a fee, he informs about the fee: "I desire to offer."
2.23.2	He says, "Do it."
2.25.2	Then he says to the four Brahmins of different families, "Feed."
2.25.3	When they have eaten, they bring the food.
2.25.4	Having accepted it with this very formula, having got down, he eats it as in the case of Madhuparka.
2.25.5	One should eat the food only after getting down. This is one view.
2.25.6	Now, this is another (point). There is a rule regarding the Arghyas alone. The others are as one wishes.
2.23.3	Having brought curd, he brings honey.
2.23.4	Having brought the younger, he places him on the elder.
2.23.5	The elder is honoured with a seat.
2.23.6	He follows with water for washing the feet, water for offering, water for sipping, and the Madhuparka.
2.23.7	Then he informs him, "This is your seat."
2.25.7	If he were to let go a cow, he would recite over her: "The cow is the mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the sister of the Adityas, the navel of immortality. I proclaim it for the one who heals the people. Do not kill the cow Aditi. Let them drink water and eat grass. Om, let go."
2.25.8	Then for the one who proclaims the Soma.
2.23.8	The king or the Brahman says to him, "May the teacher's seat be yours; may your wife not be a woman."
2.23.9	The leader of the country or the commander-in-chief says to him, “May the seat of authority be yours; may not your wife be a woman.”
2.23.10	Then he is informed, "This is water for washing the feet."
2.25.9	Where he offers Soma to him, having put on the sacrificial thread, having sipped water, standing towards the east or north, reciting while seated, he says: "You have told me life, you have told me radiance, you have told fame, you have told prosperity. May I be long-lived, radiant, famous, prosperous, and may I be endowed with wealth. May I be all of the earth, the heaven, and the sky." Having said this, he replies: "We know you."
2.23.11	He recites the following verse: "May the waters, the foot-washing waters, destroy my enemies. May there be Brahmic lustre in this family. May there be greatness in me, fame in me, power and valour in me. May it come to me. May it be united with fame, lustre, milk and brilliance. May it be the beloved of the people, the lord of cattle."
2.25.10	This is the same as the one in the text beginning with "By this alone, the messengers of the spirits" and ending with "May it not decay."
2.23.12	Having taken the left foot, he should take the right one. The king, the chief, or the commander-in-chief should do this.
2.24.1	Then he announces, "This is your welcome."
2.26.1	Then he recites over the food, "May I be like food to thee, may I be like wealth to thee. May prosperity enter me from below. May the directions flow down, may the great ones come together, may all desires be fulfilled. May the beloved ones protect me, may the beloved ones protect. Thou art glory, may I be glory in thee. He, who is this, says what he wants, having recited thus.
2.24.2	Having thus consulted with the same (verse), he says, "Thou art the milking of Viraj, thou art the milking of the milking of Viraja. The milking is in me for the sake of the milking of the Viraj." Having received it, he takes it away, saying, "I send you to the ocean. Go to your own place. May I be without a break in progeny. May my milk not be spilled."
2.24.3	Then he informs him, "This is your water for rinsing the mouth."
2.26.2	When he is about to sell, he offers with the verse, "Whatever trade I do with wealth, I do with wealth. May Soma, Agni, the Lord, Indra, and Brihaspati place wealth in it. Svāhā!"
2.24.4	"You are the covering of nectar."
2.24.5	Having sipped water, he informs him of the Madhuparka.
2.24.6	He responds with the verse: "Whatever is the supreme form of honey, may I be the supreme eater of honey, with that supreme form of honey."
2.26.3	Then, when about to enter into a debate, he takes his umbrella in his left hand, covers it with his right hand, and offers the oblation with the fist of the fruit-offering. "He offers with the formula, "May you be without tongue, may you be without tongue. I worship you with the oblation. That is true, what I am saying. Let him be below me, let him speak. Svāhā!"
2.24.7	Having accepted, he eats, saying, "You are fame, you are the fame of the three Vedas. You are the radiance of Brahman. Make me dear to the people, the lord of cattle."
2.24.8	Having sipped water three times, saying "Earth, Bhuva, Suva," he then gives it to the guest or eats it all himself.
2.24.9	Then he informs him, "This is your sipping water."
2.26.4	He recites over the one with whom he is disputing: "I give your speech to your mouth, to your mind, from your heart, from your limbs, from your limbs. I take your speech. Wherever your speech is hidden, I take it. That is true which I am saying. Be under me. Be under me."
2.24.10	"You are the cover of immortality."
2.24.11	Having sipped water, he informs him, "It is a cow."
2.24.12	He addresses her with the verse, "This is a cow, removing sin. Remove sin, remove the sin of me and this one. Remove the one who hates us. Destroy the one who hates me."
2.25.1	Then, having prepared food for him, he informs him with the verse, "
2.27.1	If they were to go forth to him as servants, having kindled the fire, he should offer oblations to the moon. "He should say, "The one who follows after has turned back, the one who has turned back has followed after. May the Indra-Paricrusher protect you from all sides. If you have wronged me, the one who is more divine than the gods, Indra, having bound you with a noose, has brought you back to me again."
2.25.2	Then he says to the four Brahmins of different families, "Feed."
2.25.3	When they have eaten, they bring the food.
2.25.4	Having accepted it with this very formula, having got down, he eats it as in the case of Madhuparka.
2.25.5	One should eat the food only after getting down. This is one view.
2.27.2	Having struck a stake of Khadira wood, one should wind it three times with blue and red threads, turning to the right. One should turn it around.
2.27.3	Even if they are far away, they will turn here.
2.25.6	Now, this is another (point). There is a rule regarding the Arghyas alone. The others are as one wishes.
2.27.4-5	He who wishes, "May he not go away from me," should touch him with his right hand. "In which the past and the future are present, in which all the gods are concentrated, with that I take you. I take you for myself. I take you to Brahman." He does not go away from him who wishes, "He may not go away from my side."
2.25.7	If he were to let go a cow, he would recite over her: "The cow is the mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the sister of the Adityas, the navel of immortality. I proclaim it for the one who heals the people. Do not kill the cow Aditi. Let them drink water and eat grass. Om, let go."
2.25.8	Then for the one who proclaims the Soma.
2.27.6	Having slept during the night of the new moon, he should bring his urine to the tip of a living reed and sprinkle it three times with the right hand. "He should recite, "I sprinkle you for the mountain, for the brother, for the sister, for all the kinsmen. Where will you seek, always, with the angry one, with the one who has been cut off by the one who has gone away? You are the one who is sprinkled, you are the one who has the sprinkling, with the one that has gone away."
2.25.9	Where he offers Soma to him, having put on the sacrificial thread, having sipped water, standing towards the east or north, reciting while seated, he says: "You have told me life, you have told me radiance, you have told fame, you have told prosperity. May I be long-lived, radiant, famous, prosperous, and may I be endowed with wealth. May I be all of the earth, the heaven, and the sky." Having said this, he replies: "We know you."
2.25.10	This is the same as the one in the text beginning with "By this alone, the messengers of the spirits" and ending with "May it not decay."
2.27.7	He does not fall from this.
2.27.8	When he is about to perform a long sacrifice,
2.28.1	when he is about to go on a journey, he gives his wife a gift.
2.28.2	Having prepared a heap of coarse grains and having ground them, he puts them on the bed of his wife who is asleep on the night of the new moon, saying, "This is for Soma, not for any other man."
2.28.3	If they desire it, they will not succeed.
2.28.4	If one desires that they should succeed, one should say to her, "Wash yourself with the urine of a black sheep."
2.28.5	One who is about to go away on a journey says, "We shall stay here, we shall stay in life."
2.26.1	Then he recites over the food, "May I be like food to thee, may I be like wealth to thee. May prosperity enter me from below. May the directions flow down, may the great ones come together, may all desires be fulfilled. May the beloved ones protect me, may the beloved ones protect. Thou art glory, may I be glory in thee. He, who is this, says what he wants, having recited thus.
2.26.2	When he is about to sell, he offers with the verse, "Whatever trade I do with wealth, I do with wealth. May Soma, Agni, the Lord, Indra, and Brihaspati place wealth in it. Svāhā!"
2.28.6	Then he addresses him with the verse, "Come to us, O Indra, with thy gentle steeds, with thy peacock-feathered arrows; may none of them be thy foes, may none of them bind thee with a noose. Come hither, O Breath, to life, to the abode on earth, to Agni, to Vayu in the atmosphere, to Surya in heaven. The prosperity which Agni, Vayu, Surya, the Moon, the Waters follow, that prosperity may I follow. Go thou, O Lord of the Bhuva, having attained it." Having attained it, he falls down, having become a hawk.
2.26.3	Then, when about to enter into a debate, he takes his umbrella in his left hand, covers it with his right hand, and offers the oblation with the fist of the fruit-offering. "He offers with the formula, "May you be without tongue, may you be without tongue. I worship you with the oblation. That is true, what I am saying. Let him be below me, let him speak. Svāhā!"
2.28.7	He who wishes, "May he return safely," should look at him with this three-verse (hymn): "May the three worlds be great."
2.28.8	He returns here again.
2.26.4	He recites over the one with whom he is disputing: "I give your speech to your mouth, to your mind, from your heart, from your limbs, from your limbs. I take your speech. Wherever your speech is hidden, I take it. That is true which I am saying. Be under me. Be under me."
2.28.9	If one wishes that he should not return, one should contemplate him with the verse, "May the Yakshma fall on him together with him." Then one should recite this mantra over him: "May Indra, the slayer of Vritra, lead you to the highest, farthest place, from which you will not return again, to the eternal seasons."
2.28.10	He does not return.
2.29.1	Then the mounting of the chariot.
2.27.1	If they were to go forth to him as servants, having kindled the fire, he should offer oblations to the moon. "He should say, "The one who follows after has turned back, the one who has turned back has followed after. May the Indra-Paricrusher protect you from all sides. If you have wronged me, the one who is more divine than the gods, Indra, having bound you with a noose, has brought you back to me again."
2.29.2	If one were to obtain a chariot on an auspicious day of the waxing moon, having yoked it, one would touch the wheels, saying, "You are Brihat," for the southern wheel, "You are Rathantara," for the northern wheel, and "You are Vamadeva," for the middle wheel.
2.29.3	Having mounted the horse, one should rub the wheels, saying "The wheels are on both sides." This is the remainder of the Anuvaka.
2.27.2	Having struck a stake of Khadira wood, one should wind it three times with blue and red threads, turning to the right. One should turn it around.
2.27.3	Even if they are far away, they will turn here.
2.29.4	If the chariot is of Śamara wood, then having put on the sacrificial thread, having sipped water, he touches the ground with the verses, "Here is firmness, here is self-control, here is joy, here is delight."
2.29.5	Then the mounting of the elephant.
2.27.4-5	He who wishes, "May he not go away from me," should touch him with his right hand. "In which the past and the future are present, in which all the gods are concentrated, with that I take you. I take you for myself. I take you to Brahman." He does not go away from him who wishes, "He may not go away from my side."
2.29.6	If he obtains an elephant, he should sit down after having made it on an auspicious day and in an auspicious constellation, saying, "With Indra's thunderbolt I strike him, the son of so-and-so, and I am superior to my enemies."
2.29.7	Then he makes it advance, saying, "Go, O Time, go, O Prosperity, go, make me prosper."
2.29.8	The chariot is equal to the time.
2.27.6	Having slept during the night of the new moon, he should bring his urine to the tip of a living reed and sprinkle it three times with the right hand. "He should recite, "I sprinkle you for the mountain, for the brother, for the sister, for all the kinsmen. Where will you seek, always, with the angry one, with the one who has been cut off by the one who has gone away? You are the one who is sprinkled, you are the one who has the sprinkling, with the one that has gone away."
2.29.9	If one sits on an unspread out piece of ground, one recites this: "Salutations to Rudra who resides on the earth, to Rudra who is in the wind, salutations to Rudra, to Rudra residing on the earth."
2.29.10	When moving like a snake, one recites: "Salutations, to Rudra moving like a snake in the wind, to Rudra, salutations to the one moving like a snake."
2.29.11	He recites the verse, "Salutations to Rudra, the lord of excrement, to the wind-god, salutations to Rudra. Salutations to Rudra, to the lord of excremen"
2.29.12	If he crosses over fresh cowdung, having said, "You are a cowpen," he should cross over.
2.27.7	He does not fall from this.
2.27.8	When he is about to perform a long sacrifice,
2.28.1	when he is about to go on a journey, he gives his wife a gift.

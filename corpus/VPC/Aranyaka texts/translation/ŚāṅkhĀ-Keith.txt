1.1.1	Prajāpati is the year;
1.1.2	the Mahāvrata is his body;
1.1.3	therefore one should not recite it for another, lest one place in that other the body of all beings.
1.1.4	Again, the Mahāvrata is the body of Indra;
1.1.5	therefore one should not recite it for another, lest one place in that other the body of Indra.
1.1.6	Again, the Mahāvrata is the body of the man, composed of Ṛc, Yajus, and Sāman verses, whom they make ready;
1.1.7	therefore one should not recite it for another, lest one place in that other the body of all the metres.
1.1.8	One may, however, recite it (for another) as Hotr priest of Sattrins
1.1.9	or for one's father or teacher. For in that case the recitation is really for himself,
1.1.10	and by his own self he perfects the sacrifice.
1.1.11	The Stoma of the Mahāvrata is of twenty-five parts.
1.1.12	Twenty-four, indeed, are the half-months of the year, so that the year is made up.
1.1.13	Again, Prajāpati, the year, is of twenty-five parts.
1.1.14	Twenty-four parts are placed at the beginning, and the end is the twenty-fifth.
1.1.15	A bull is to be offered to Indra and a goat to Prajāpati.
1.1.16	That day, indeed, is Indra's;
1.1.17	Indra is Prajāpati.
1.1.18	(The goat) is the symbol of Prajāpati.
1.1.19	Again, among animals the bull is the symbol of Indra.
1.2.1	The Ājya Śastra of the Mahāvrata is the twelve-verse hymn, 'The guest of every man.'
1.2.2	Twelve, indeed, are the months in the year; so the year is made up.
1.2.3	In this hymn there are two metres, Gāyatrī and Anustubh.
1.2.4	In the recitation one adds the twenty-five-verse hymn 'Agni, from fire-sticks, men with devotion.'
1.2.5	For the Stoma is of twenty-five parts,
1.2.6	and the Śastra is perfect in form when it corresponds with the Stoma.
1.2.7	In this hymn there are two metres, Virāj and Triṣṭubh.
1.2.8	These make up four (metres).
1.2.9	This all, indeed, is fourfold, so that all this is made up.
1.2.10	The Prauga Śastra is in Triṣṭubh.
1.2.11	The Triṣṭubh is the metre of Indra,
1.2.12	and so he is united with his own metre.
1.2.13	The (TṚca), ' Were not they, who were magnified by praise,' is addressed to Vāyu, and contains the words 'great' and 'magnify,'
1.2.14	It contains the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great' (Mahāvrata).
1.2.15	The following TṚca, 'As far as the strength of the body, as far as might,' is addressed to Indra and Vāyu, because (of the expression) 'As far as men peṚceiving with vision.'
1.2.16	'The fair eye of you two, Varuṇa,' is (the TṚca) addressed to Mitra and Varuṇa, because (of the expression) 'The sun goes extending (the light) of the two gods.'
1.2.17	'Who will hear, who of those who merit worship,' is (the TṚca) addressed to the Aśvins, because (of the expression) 'Whom the daughter of the sun chose.'
1.2.18	'How, what priest's (sacrifice) has the great one magnified,' is (the TṚca) addressed to Indra, and contains the words 'great' and 'magnify.'
1.2.19	It contains the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great,'
1.2.20	'Who is of you a protector, Vasus, who of you a guardian,' is (the TṚca) addressed to the All-gods, because of the expression 'Varuṇa, Mitra, from the stronger moṛtal.'
1.2.21	'May this Sarasvatī, glad,' is (the TṚca) addressed to Sarasvatī, because of the expression 'He has opened the doors of Ṛta, happy one.'
1.2.22	This is the Prauga Śastra of Vāmadeva, arranged in TṚcas in Triṣṭubhs, and containing the word 'Ka.'
1.2.23	Prajāpati, indeed, is Vāmadeva; in Prajāpati so do they obtain all desires.
1.2.24	Others say the (Śastra of the) morning pressing should not be in Triṣṭubhs.
1.2.25	Otherwise it confuses the (parts of the service) which have fixed metres.
1.2.26	(The Śastra) should be that of the one-day rite.
1.2.27	The one-day rite is Brahman;
1.2.28	this day is Brahman;
1.2.29	so Brahman is perfected by Brahman.
1.3.1	'Thee as a car for help' is the strophe of the Marutvatīya Śastra.
1.3.2	'This juice pressed, Vasu,' is the antistrophe.
1.3.3	This is the regular scheme for the one-day rite.
1.3.4	The Brāhmaṇa as to it has already been set forth.
1.3.5	After reciting first the (hymn of) VaŚukra, 'Fair has been the singer's onset,' he inserts a Nivid in the Triṣṭubh (hymn), 'Great, hero-like, controlling men, is Indra.'
1.3.6	Now (the reason) that he recites the VaŚukra hymn first is
1.3.7	that Indra is VaŚukra,
1.3.8	and (the reason for reciting) 'Great, hero-like, controlling men, is Indra,' is that it contains the word 'great,'
1.3.9	for this day is described as 'great.'
1.4.1	Then he offers the oblations of ghee.
1.4.2	Thus he wins success
1.4.3	for the calming of the sacrifice and the healing of the sacrificers.
1.4.4	There are eight (oblations).
1.4.5	By these, indeed, the gods obtained all success;
1.4.6	thus also do sacrificers by means of them obtain all success.
1.4.7	Then he mutters the mutterings accompanying the Pārimads.
1.4.8	They are Pārimads (those which boil around). The waters indeed are Pārimads,
1.4.9	for by the waters all this is boiled around,
1.4.10	and so they are the Pārimads.
1.4.11	Now the hymn is food.
1.4.12	The waters indeed come first before the coming of food,
1.4.13	and the waters are the Pārimads.
1.4.14	Again, the Pārimads are the nails, teeth, body, and hair.
1.4.15	Therefore are they to be employed, for they are bringers of good fortune.
1.4.16	There are twenty-five and the conclusion.
1.4.17	The Aṅgirasa (Sāman) serves as a support;
1.4.18	of that it is a symbol.
1.4.19	(Then comes the) Bhūtechad (Sāman);
1.4.20	(in reciting it he feels) 'I have reached Indra's dear abode.'
1.4.21	Then the Krośa and Anukrośa (they use) —
1.4.22	(thereby) have they won;
1.4.23	then the Payas (Sāman) —
1.4.24	(thereby) have they won;
1.4.25	then the Arka and Arkapuṣpa (Sāmans).
1.4.26	Arka is Agni here;
1.4.27	Arkapuṣpa is Āditya.
1.4.28	If the Sāman singers sing a round according to these (Sāmans), then they say to the Hotr priest, 'Mutter after us.'
1.4.29	If they sing, he should mutter after them;
1.4.30	if they sing thus, or even if they do not sing, he should mutter all the same.
1.5.1	These are the seven divine metres;
1.5.2	therefore he should mutter after the (Sāman singers).
1.5.3	Again, Indra's indeed is this day,
1.5.4	for Indra are the mutterings;
1.5.5	therefore he should mutter after them.
1.5.6	Then standing there he adores the fire in each of its members, saying 'Honour, Honour.'
1.5.7	For the gods are not above receiving honour.
1.5.8	He should honour the parts of the fire when it is kindled, if it is on the high altar.
1.5.9	Then standing there he adores the sun.
1.5.10	Some say he should make an opening in the shed;
1.5.11	but he should only perform his adoration in the direction (of the sun).
1.5.12	For being concealed in this highest hymn, before the highest, he utters the benedictions. 'The great hath united with the great' — 
1.5.13	Agni indeed is great, the earth is great,
1.5.14	for these two have united;
1.5.15	'The god hath united with the goddess' —
1.5.16	Vāyu is the god, the atmosphere the goddess,
1.5.17	for these two have united;
1.5.18	'The Brahman hath united with the Brāhmaṇī' —
1.5.19	the sun is the Brahman, the heaven the Brāhmaṇī,
1.5.20	for these two have united.
1.5.21	So does he unite these worlds for him who will chant this hymn.
1.6.1	Viśvāmitra, indeed, went to the dear home of Indra by reason of recitation and the performance of vows.
1.6.2	To him said Indra, 'Viśvāmitra, choose a boon.'
1.6.3	Viśvāmitra said, 'Let me know thee.'
1.6.4	'(Choose) again.'
1.6.5	'Thee only.'
1.6.6	'(Choose) a third time.'
1.6.7	'Thee only.'
1.6.8	To him said Indra, 'I am the great (m.) and the great (f.);
1.6.9	the god and the goddess;
1.6.10	the Brahman and the Brāhmaṇī.'
1.6.11	Viśvāmitra was still fain to know more.
1.6.12	To him said Indra, 'I am that which I have said, but what is more, he that performs no penance may be even such as I am.'
1.6.13	Then indeed did Indra proclaim the Vyāhṛtis. They sufficed for him.
1.6.14	Then (the Hotr), after gathering to himself the plank of the swing, draws in his breath thrice, after thrice breathing out.
1.7.1	The (plank of the swing) is of Udumbara wood.
1.7.2	Strength and proper food are the Udumbara, so that strength and proper food are won.
1.7.3	Then, after touching it with his breast, putting his right side over it, he mutters, 'Thou art the sun. Let the Vasus mount thee with the Gayatrl metre. They are thy mounters.'
1.7.4	So he says, and 'After them I mount for royal sway.'
1.7.5	This, indeed, do they count royal sway.
1.7.6	Then, putting his left side over (the swing), he mutters, 'Let the Rudras mount thee with the Triṣṭubh metre. They are thy mounters.'
1.7.7	So he says, and 'After them I mount for self-rule.'
1.7.8	Self-rule, indeed, is, as it were, something more than royal sway.
1.7.9	Then, putting his right side over, he mutters, 'Let the Ādityas mount thee with the Jagatī metre. They are thy mounters.'
1.7.10	So he says, and 'After them I mount for universal sway.'
1.7.11	Universal sway, indeed, is, as it were, something more than self-rule.
1.7.12	Then, putting his left side over, he mutters, 'Let the All-gods mount thee with the Anustubh metre. They are thy mounters.'
1.7.13	So he says, and 'After them I mount for the fulfilling of desire.'
1.7.14	The fulfilling of desire is the best of all.
1.7.15	Then, having slipped along over (the plank), he brings down his feet towards the east and rests them on the ground.
1.7.16	He is thus higher than this world.
1.7.17	(The reason) why he places (his feet so) is that he thus rests on this world as a secure resting-place.
1.7.18	Then he breathes forth thrice and draws in breath thrice.
1.7.19	Then, making a lap over the south and north (sides of the plank), he strokes the plank of the swing from west to east with the span of the right (hand),
1.7.20	saying, 'Prajāpati mount thee, Vāyu swing thee.'
1.7.21	Prajāpati indeed mounts it, Vāyu swings it, as alive.
1.7.22	Then he breathes forth and draws in breath thrice.
1.7.23	Then, holding both hands to the east, he mutters.
1.8.1	'May speech with breath, I with breath, eye with mind, I with mind, Prajāpati with cattle, I with cattle (be united).' So he prays.
1.8.2	'Thou art a fair-winged bird' —
1.8.3	breath has fair wings;
1.8.4	'I shall proclaim this speech' — he speaks being minded to proclaim this speech; 'which will effect much, I who am minded to effect much' —
1.8.5	for this speech is going to effect much,
1.8.6	and much (will he effect) who gains the Śastra of this day;
1.8.7	'which will effect more than much, I who am minded to effect more than much' — for this speech is going to effect more than much, and more than much (will he effect) who gains the Śastra of this day;
1.8.8	'which will go to heaven, I that am minded to go to heaven' — for this speech is going to go to heaven, and to heaven (will he go) who gains the Śastra of this day;
1.8.9	'I that am minded to bear these sacrificers to heaven,' so let him say;
1.8.10	but (for a sacrificer) whom he hates, let him say, 'Not N. N., not N. N.'
1.8.11	So many, indeed, as he enumerates and shakes forth from this divine chariot, he casts forth.
1.8.12	The two (following) are not for him to enjoy;
1.8.13	so he oveṚcomes him (breath);
1.8.14	so, having oveṚcome him, he places him in his body.
1.8.15	Vāyu, indeed, becoming breath recites this hymn.
1.8.16	So he oveṚcomes him;
1.8.17	so, having oveṚcome him, he places him in his body.
1.8.18	Yoked indeed to his teacher is he who gains the Śastra of this day. Being yoked to his teacher, his breath is liable to be taken away.
1.8.19	So he oveṚcomes him;
1.8.20	so, having oveṚcome him, he places him in his body.
1.8.21	For such a divinity there is no pieṚcing by poisoned (arrow), nor sword, nor axe, nor anything else.
1.8.22	He who reviles him who knows this becomes worse;
1.8.23	not so he who knows this.
1.8.24	There is no pieṚcing one who knows.
2.1.1	He begins the hymn with the word 'him.'
2.1.2	The word 'him' is breath; by breath he begins the hymn.
2.1.3	Again, the word 'him' is strength and sap; so he places in the hymn strength and sap.
2.1.4	Again, the word 'him' is immoṛtality; so he places immoṛtality in himself.
2.1.5	The Rājana is (the Sāman of) the Pṛṣṭha (Stotra).
2.1.6	The Rājana is manifestly the Sāman;
2.1.7	so he unites (the hymn) with its own Sāman.
2.1.8	It consists of verses not specially marked.
2.1.9	Prajāpati, indeed, is not specially marked.
2.1.10	That is the symbol of Prajāpati.
2.1.11	Some say it should consist of verses with 'Ka' in them, for Ka is Prajāpati and that is a symbol of Prajāpati.
2.1.12	Who indeed is Prajāpati?
2.1.13	That is the symbol of Prajāpati.
2.1.14	Then he recites inaudibly the silent recitation.
2.1.15	Speech indeed is this day, mind the silent recitation;
2.1.16	so with mind he perfects speech.
2.1.17	'That was mightiest in the worlds' is the strophe TṚca. 
2.1.18	' Waxing with strength, of great might,' has the word 'wax,' and so has the word 'great,'
2.1.19	for the day is described as 'great.'
2.1.20	The body is of twenty-five parts.
2.1.21	He recites (the hymn) with the addition of the nada (verses).
2.1.22	The body indeed is of twenty-five parts, offspring and cattle are additions,
2.1.23	so he increases the body by children, cattle, servants, and food, (in using) the nada verses.
2.1.24	He puts the Triṣṭubh Pādas first, then the Pādas of the nada verses.
2.1.25	Having joined the first Pāda of the nada verses with the first Triṣṭubh Pāda, he pauses;
2.1.26	having joined the second with the second Triṣṭubh (Pāda), he utters the syllable om.
2.1.27	Having joined the third with the third Triṣṭubh (Pāda), he pauses;
2.1.28	Having joined the fourth with the fourth Triṣṭubh (Pāda), he utters the syllable om.
2.1.29	He recites thrice the first (verse) thus varied, and the others which follow are simiḍārly varied.
2.1.30	He omits the second half-verse of the third verse of the hymn and the second of the nada.
2.1.31	This is the opening of the mouth; by that he utters speech. By the mouth indeed he utters speech.
2.1.32	He recites these two (half-verses) before the Dvipadās. Thus his Stotra verse is not separated by a break. After reciting the body (verses), he recites the sūdadohas (verse) 'of the milk-yielder,'
2.1.33	Food indeed is the sūdadohas (verse). By food these joints are united.
2.1.34	Again, immoṛtality is the sūdadohas (verse); so he places immoṛtality in the body.
2.1.35	Again, the sūdadohas (verse) is the form of the Āhāva call.
2.1.36	So just as wood may be joined by a string or a piece of leather, the sūdadohas verse joins all the Vedas.
2.2.1	Then he recites the head (verses).
2.2.2	They consist of three TṚcas.
2.2.3	Three indeed are the bones of his head; them by these he unites.
2.2.4	These he unites by those.
2.2.5	These three again are each threefold, and so make up nine verses.
2.2.6	Nine indeed are the breaths in the head.
2.2.7	They have the word 'hymn' in them.
2.2.8	This is the symbol of this day.
2.3.1	Then he recites the neck (verses).
2.3.2	They are three verses.
2.3.3	Three indeed are the joints of the neck.
2.3.4	These he unites by those.
2.3.5	The last is an Uṣṇih.
2.3.6	It is the shoulder, laṛge and expansive.
2.4.1	Then he recites the collarbone (verse).
2.4.2	It is a Triṣṭubh.
2.4.3	Therefore the collarbone is the strongest.
2.4.4	The (verse) 'Indra, the mighty arms of thee, strong one,' is suitable to the arms.
2.4.5	Then he recites the strophe and antistrophe of the Rathantara.
2.4.6	The Brāhmaṇa for them has been set forth already.
2.4.7	Then he recites the Dhāyyā (verse).
2.4.8	This is the Dhāyyā,
2.4.9	for it is placed in all beings.
2.4.10	It indeed is placed on the right side,
2.4.11	therefore a woman lies on a man's right side.
2.4.12	Then he recites the Pragātha of the Rathantara.
2.4.13	The Brāhmaṇa for it has been set forth already.
2.4.14	The hymn is 'Who alone of moṛtals deserves oblation.' He recites it by Pādas.
2.4.15-16	Taking out the second verse of it, he puts in as second (verse) the second (verse) of the hymn, 'All my other friends have come.'
2.4.17	Thus he interweaves the two sides to prevent them separating.
2.4.18	Therefore he performs all actions by (the use of) both sides.
2.5.1	Then he recites the hand (verses).
2.5.2	They indeed are three.
2.5.3	These are the joints of his hand.
2.5.4	These he unites by those.
2.5.5	The first is in an excessive metre. This is the thumb.
2.5.6	So the thumb approaches all the fingers.
2.5.7	The right side has the Rathantara,
2.5.8	the left the Bṛhat,
2.5.9	and the Brāhmaṇa for it has been set forth.
2.5.10	These two sides, with Bṛhat and Bathantara, are of twenty-four parts.
2.5.11	Twenty-four are the half-months of the year, so that the year is made up.
2.6.1	Then he recites the Caturuttara (verses). They are the spine.
2.6.2	They are twenty-one verses.
2.6.3	Twenty-one indeed are the joints of the spine.
2.6.4	These he unites by those.
2.6.5	They make up seven TṚcas.
2.6.6	Seven indeed are the metres, so that all the metres are made up.
2.6.7	They have the word 'hymn.'
2.6.8	That is the symbol of this day.
2.7.1	Then he recites the (sets of) eighty verses.
2.7.2	He recites them in correspondence with the Stotra verses, Gāyatrī (corresponding to) Gayatra, Uṣṇih and Bṛhati (sets) to Bṛhad and Rathantara.
2.7.3	The Gāyatrī (set) is the right side, the Uṣṇih the left, the Bṛhati the middle.
2.7.4	In the middle indeed of the body is food deposited.
2.7.5	Between the two Triṣṭubhs there is a Triṣṭubh in a Nivid.
2.7.6	They belong to Viśvāmitra, are corresponding, and have the word 'hymn.'
2.7.7	For Viśvāmitra was the seer of that (hymn).
2.7.8	The strophes contain the word 'great,' and they have the word 'magnify.'
2.7.9	It (the hymn) has the word 'magnified' and the word 'great.'
2.7.10	It has the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.'
2.8.1	'Great Indra, who by might,' and 'is magnified by Vatsa's lauds': with this verse he commences the Gāyatrī (set of) eighty (verses). It (the verse) contains both the words 'great' and 'magnify.'
2.8.2	It (the litany) has the words 'great' and 'magnified.'
2.8.3	It has the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.'
2.9.1	'What joys thou didst bring, Indra,' and 'his praises magnify, great one' : with this verse he begins the Bṛhati (set of) eighty (verses). It (the verse) contains both the words 'great' and 'magnify.'
2.9.2	It (the hymn) has the words 'great' and 'magnify.' 
2.9.3	It has the word ' great,' for this day is described as ' great.'
2.9.4	'May this delightful (Soma) for thee 'and 'Hither, with thy bay steeds, Indra,' are the two hymns.
2.9.5	(The reason) why he recites them at the end is that he may commence the Uṣṇih (set of) eighty verses (after concluding) with perfect Bṛhatis.
2.10.1	'Indra in the poured libations,' and 'He gains the power that magnifies; for he is great': with this verse he begins the Uṣṇih (set of) eighty verses. It (the verse) contains both the words 'great' and 'magnify.'
2.10.2	It (the hymn) has the words 'great' and 'magnify.'
2.10.3	It has the word 'great,' for this day is described as ' great.'
2.10.4	These sets of eighty (verses) recited together make up 720.
2.10.5	720 indeed are the days and nights of the year. Thus by these (sets of) eighty he obtains the days and nights of the year.
2.10.6	Some make into Uṣṇihs the Gāyatrīs by means of the ends of the Sāmans;
2.10.7	others, again, add (to make the Uṣṇihs) (sets of) four syllables.
2.10.8	From the Bṛhati (set of) eighty (verses) he takes out eighty (sets of) fovir syllables; from the Kakubh Pragiithas twenty-four (sets of) four syllables; these 104 sets of four syllables he inserts in the 104 Gayatrls. So the Gāyatrīs are turned into Uṣṇihs.
2.10.9	So the Gāyatrīs are turned into Uṣṇihs.
2.10.10	But one need not be concerned with this.
2.10.11	The (result) is here brought about.
2.10.12-13	'Sing to Indra the Sāman': (the reason) why he recites this last is that he may commence the vasa (hymn), (after concluding) with perfect Uṣṇihs.
2.11.1	Then he recites the vasa (hymn).
2.11.2	The belly is the vasa hymn.
2.11.3	With it, when made ready, whatever is outside it would come into immediate proximity.
2.11.4	Thus it matures what is within the belly.
2.11.5	Therefore many deities and many metres are recited in the vasa (hymn).
2.11.6	Therefore much variegated food is deposited in the belly.
2.11.7	Then (he recites) the two half-verses which were taken out.
2.11.8	Then (he recites) the sūdadohas (verse).
2.11.9	It is then left out (afterwards). 
2.11.10	Here it has been recited twenty-four times.
2.12.1	Then he recites the Dvipadās.
2.12.2	Metre indeed is a support, so that the Dvipadās serve as a support.
2.13.1	Then he recites the hymn to Indra and Agni, reciting it as in Gāyatrī.
2.13.2	Indra and Agni are supports, so that support is obtained.
2.14.1	Then he recites the Āvapana.
2.14.2	The Āvapana is a support, so that support is obtained.
2.14.3	Then these go on again straight forward.
2.15.1	Then he recites the Anustubh text.
2.15.2	Speech indeed is this day; speech the Anustubh. So in speech he places speech.
2.15.3	'Ye have gone to the sky, ye have gone to the sky': with this hymn he approaches the gods.
2.15.4	The TṚca 'He, of old, inspiring sages,' has the word 'hymn,' and by reason of it is perfect.
2.15.5	The last verse is in Gāyatrī, and by reason of it it is perfect.
2.15.6	In 'Thou art the great ruler here' there is the word ' great,'
2.15.7	for this day is described as 'great.'
2.16.1	Then he recites the hundred Triṣṭubhs.
2.16.2	The Triṣṭubh is Indra's metre; so he perfects him with his own metre.
2.16.3	The Hiraṇyastūpa-hymn and the Yātaūtīya hymn correspond to the Bṛhat and Rathantara. For the Bṛhat and Rathantara are put in front.
2.16.4	The Sajanīya hymn and (the hymn) 'Priests, bear to Indra the Soma' make up twenty-seven verses.
2.16.5	Twenty-seven are the Nakṣatras;
2.16.6	thus he obtains the majesty of the Nakṣatras.
2.16.7	He should recite (a hymn) of Viśvāmitra,
2.16.8	for Viśvāmitra beheld it.
2.16.9	He should recite (a hymn) of Vāmadeva, for that is pleasant to the gods.
2.16.10	He should recite (a hymn) of Vasiṣṭha, for that is best for the gods.
2.16.11	Then before the Udubrahmiya (hymn) he recites (the verses) with interwoven Pādas.
2.16.12	All desires, indeed, are within this hymn.
2.16.13	Just as having shut cattle in a pen one puts a bar and a pin (to keep them in), so by these intertwined verses he grasps all desires on either side and places them in the body.
2.16.14	Again, of the Udubrahmiya hymn the last (verse) has the word 'hymn.'
2.16.15	That is the symbol of this day.
2.16.16	He concludes by repeating this (verse) thrice.
2.16.17	Having concluded he mutters the Ukthavīrya.
2.16.18	The one-day form comes first;
2.16.19	the one-day is a support, so that support is obtained.
2.16.20	The Mahāvrata form comes next.
2.16.21	In 'Thou art great' there is the word 'great,' 
2.16.22	for this day is described as ' great.'
2.17.1	Reckoning in the sūdadohas verse, recited once, which has to be supplied throughout the litany, but without the silent recitation, there are a thousand Bṛhatis.
2.17.2	In this thousand Bṛhatis there are thirty-six thousand syllables.
2.17.3	So many are the days of a hundred years;
2.17.4	thus he obtains the days of a hundred years.
2.17.5	Some say (the thousand) is composed of Anustubhs.
2.17.6	Speech indeed is that day,
2.17.7	speech the Anustubh,
2.17.8	speech all beings;
2.17.9	again, speech is this all, so they say.
2.17.10	But it is fixed that it is composed of Bṛhatis.
2.17.11	For he that gives heat here is connected with the Bṛhati;
2.17.12	so he perfects him with his own metre.
2.17.13	Three times he calls (to the Adhvaryu).
2.17.14	Three indeed are these worlds;
2.17.15	so he obtains these worlds.
2.17.16	The Yājya verse is taken from the one-day (rite).
2.17.17	The one-day (rite) is a support, so that support is obtained.
2.17.18	They loosen the swing, before the secondary vaṣaṭ cry is made.
2.17.19	He descends towards the east (to meet) him who bears the Graha as he advances.
2.17.20	He thrusts away to the west the plank of the swing.
2.17.21	Touching the Graha, he mutters, 'This victory I have won, let me be associated with it, lest I sever myself from this victory.'
2.17.22	The Atigrāhya is for Viśvakarman.
2.17.23	Prajāpati's indeed is this day,
2.17.24	Prajāpati is Viśvakarman;
2.17.25	thus he perfects him with his own symbol.
2.17.26	This day Indra proclaimed to Aṅgiras, Aṅgiras to Dīṛghatamas.
2.17.27	Therefore did Dīṛghatamas live ten lives of man.
2.17.28	This, too, the Ṛṣi has recorded, Dīṛghatamas, son of Mamata, in the words 'In the tenth stage of eld.'
2.17.29	If a man desire life, this is the Śastra to use, so said Kauṣitaki.
2.17.30	So he who knows thus and recites (the litany of) this day, lives all his life in this world
2.17.31	and obtains immoṛtality and imperishableness in the world of heaven.
2.18.1	'We choose that of Savitṛ' is the strophe of the Vaiśvadeva
2.18.2	(The strophe) contains the word 'great' because of the occurrence of 'we choose.'
2.18.3	(The Śastra) has the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.'
2.18.4	'To-day, god Savitṛ' is the antistrophe.
2.18.5	It contains the word 'great' because of the occurrence of the words 'May we win all good things.'
2.18.6	(The Śastra) has the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.'
2.18.7-8	'That desirable greatness of the god Savitṛ' is a Savitṛ hymn. It has the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.'
2.18.9	'They, heaven and earth, all propitious,' is a hymn to heaven and earth.
2.18.10-11	(The verse) 'Widely-capacious, great, never-failing,' contains the word 'great,' for this day is described as 'great.'
2.18.12	'Why has the best, why has the youngest, come to us,' is a hymn to the Ṛbhus.
2.18.13	(The verse) 'We blame not the bowl of great birth' contains the word 'great,'
2.18.14	for this day is described as 'great.'
2.18.15	'Of the aged, grey-haired Hotr,' is the Water hymn, addressed to the All-gods.
2.18.16	For that is the water of the gods.
2.18.17	He places a Nivid in the (hymn) of the one-day rite.
2.18.18	The one-day (rite) is support, so that support is won.
2.18.19	The (hymn of the) one-day rite is addressed to Vaiśvānara.
2.18.20	The one-day- (rite) is support, so that support is won.
2.18.21	'The Maruts rushing onwards with gleaming lances,' is a hymn to the Maruts.
2.18.22	(The hymn) contains the words 'mighty' and 'great' in 'Ye great ones, mightily and wide ye rule,'
2.18.23	for this day is described as great.
2.18.24	'Of a truth the fair refulgence was established' is a hymn to Jātavedas. The last (verse), 'With hymns of might hath Agni now been praised,' contains the word 'hymn.'
2.18.25	That is the symbol of this day. These are the hymns of the Āgnimāruta (Śastra).
2.18.26	These are the hymns of this day.
2.18.27	So ends the Agniṣṭoma.
2.18.28	Brahman (n.) is the Agniṣṭoma.
2.18.29	Brahman is this day.
2.18.30	So they place Brahman in Brahman.
2.18.31	They obtain immoṛtality who observe (the ritual of) this day.
7.1.1	Om. I shall proclaim the right,
7.1.2	I shall proclaim the true.
7.1.3	May that avail me; may that avail the speaker; may it avail me; may it avail the speaker.
7.1.4	In me be radiance; in me greatness.
7.1.5	Speech rests on my mind;
7.1.6	my mind on speech.
7.1.7-8	Be thou revealed to me, that art hidden in Veda and Sāman.
7.1.9	Right, hurt me not.
7.1.10	I spend day and night in learning this.
7.1.11	Agni, honour and oblation, honour and oblation;
7.1.12	honour be there to the Ṛṣis who made the Mantras, who are lords of the Mantras, to the gods.
7.1.13	May Sarasvatī be propitious, bearing favour, and kindly to us. May we not be severed from thy sight.
7.1.14	Mind undeceived, living eye, sun best of lights.
7.1.15	Consecration, harm me not.
7.2.1	Then follows the Saṃhitā Upanisad.
7.2.2	'Earth is the symbol of the former, the sky of the latter. Wind is the union,' says Sauravīra Māṇḍukeya.
7.2.3	'Ether is the union,' Māṇḍavya taught in this connection, 'for it is not considered independent, and so I have not agreed with his son.'
7.2.4	Agastya says, 'It is independent.'
7.2.5	So wind and ether are the same.
7.2.6	So far as regards the deities.
7.2.7	Now as regards the self.
7.2.8	'Speech is the symbol of the former, mind the form of the latter. Breath is the union,' says Sauravīra Māṇḍukeya.
7.2.9	Then his son, Dīṛgha (the tall one), says, 'By mind he first proclaims, then speaks with speech.
7.2.10	Therefore is mind the symbol of the former, speech of the latter. The union is mind, speech, and breath.'
7.2.11	This chariot, drawn by horses, with a triple yoke, compact of mind, speech, and breath, bears (man) to the world of heaven.
7.2.12	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days. So the Māṇḍukeyas.
7.3.1	Then follows (the doctrine) of Śākalya.
7.3.2	The earth is the symbol of the former, the heaven of the latter. The wind is the union; the rain is the junction, Parjanya the joiner.
7.3.3	When a great cloud rains mightily and unceasing, (they say), 'Heaven and earth have joined together.'
7.3.4	So far as regards the deities.
7.3.5	Now as regards the self.
7.3.6	This person is all egg-shaped.
7.3.7	There are two halves.
7.3.8	In it this is the symbol of the former, this of the latter.
7.3.9	Between them here is this ether,
7.3.10	just as there is that ether between heaven and earth. In this ether breath is stretched, just as in that ether wind is stretched.
7.3.11	As those are those three lights, so there are these three lights.
7.3.12	As there is that sun in the heaven, so there is this eye in the head.
7.3.13	As there is that lightning in the atmosphere, so there is this heart in the body.
7.3.14	As there is this fire on earth, so there is this seed in the oṛgan.
7.3.15	Thus, as it were, having compared the body (with the macrocosm) in all points, he says, 'This is the symbol of the former, this of the latter.' The union is mind, speech, and breath.
7.3.16	This chariot drawn by horses, with a triple yoke, compact of mind, speech, and breath, bears (man) to the world of heaven.
7.3.17	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.4.1	The earth is the symbol of the former, the heaven of the latter. Wind is the union, the quarters the junction, the sun the joiner,’ says Viśvāmitra.
7.4.2	So far as regards the gods.
7.4.3	Now as regards the self.
7.4.4	Speech is the symbol of the former, mind of the latter. Breath is the union, the ear the junction, the eye the joiner.
7.4.5	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.5.1	Fire is the symbol of the former, the moon of the latter. Lighting is the union,’ says Sūryadatta.
7.5.2	So far as regards the deities. 
7.5.3	Now as regards the self. Speech is the symbol of the former, mind of the latter. Truth is the union.
7.5.4	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.6.1	'The earth is the symbol of the former, the heaven of the latter. Time is the union,’ says Rādheya.
7.6.2	So far as regards the deities.
7.6.3	Now as regards the self. Speech is the symbol of the former, mind of the latter. The self is the union.
7.6.4	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.7.1	'Speech is the symbol of the former, mind of the latter.
7.7.2	Knowledge is the union,' says Pauṣkarasadi. He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.8.1	Then follow the imprecations.
7.8.2	One should know that breath is the beam.
7.8.3-4	If one who calls this breath the beam should revile another, if he think himself strong, he says, 'Thou hast grasped breath, the beam. Thou canst not be fain to grasp breath, the beam.'
7.8.5	Then he should say to him, 'Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.'
7.8.6	Again, if he think himself weak, he should say, ' Thou hast been fain to grasp breath, the beam. That thou hast not been able to grasp. Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.'
7.8.7	But whatever, whether speaking or not, he says to him, it is ceṛtain that it shall be accomplished.
7.8.8	He should not, however, say anything save what is favourable to a Brāhmaṇa. Only in exceeding prosperity may he speak thus to a Brāhmaṇa. ' Not even in exceeding prosperity. Let there be honour to Brāhmaṇas,' says Sauravīra Māṇḍukeya.
7.9.1	If another revile him who calls breath the beam, if he think him strong, he says, 'I have been fain to grasp breath, the beam; thou canst not be fain to grasp it.'
7.9.2	Then he should say to him, 'Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.'
7.9.3-4	Again, if he think him weak, he should say to him, 'Thou hast been fain to grasp breath, the beam. That thou hast not been able to grasp. Breath, the beam, will forsake thee.'
7.9.5	But whatever, whether speaking or not,' he says to him, it is ceṛtain that it shall be accomplished.
7.9.6	He should not, however, say anything save what is favourable to a Brāhmaṇa. Only in exceeding prosperity may he speak thus to a Brāhmaṇa. ' Not even in exceeding prosperity. Let there be honour to Brāhmaṇas,' says Sauravīra Māṇḍukeya.
7.10.1	Then follow the declarers of the Nirbhuja.
7.10.2	The Nirbhuja rests on earth, the Pratrnna on heaven, the Ubhayamantarena on the atmosphere.
7.10.3-4	If a man who recites the Nirbhuja revile another, he should say to him, 'Thou hast offended earth, the deity; earth, the deity, will punish thee.'
7.10.5	If a man who recites the Pratrnna revile another, he should say to him, 'Thou hast offended heaven, the deity; heaven, the deity, will punish thee.'
7.10.6	If a man who recites the Ubhayamantarena revile another, he should say thus to him, 'Thou hast offended the atmosphere, the deity; the atmosphere, the deity, will punish thee.'
7.10.7	For when he manifests the Sandhi, that is the form of the Nirbhuja;
7.10.8	when he utters the two syllables in their natural form, that is the form of the Pratrnna and the original;
7.10.9	in the Ubhayamantarena both are included.
7.10.10	He who desires proper food should recite the Nirbhuja; who desires heaven, the Pratrnna; who desires both, the Ubhayamantarena.
7.10.11	Again, if he who recites the Nirbhuja revile another,he should say to him, 'Thou hast fallen from the two lower stations.'
7.10.12	If he who recites the Pratrnna revile another, he should say to him, 'Thou hast fallen from the two higher places,'
7.10.13	But for him who recites the Ubhayamantarena there is no rebuke possible.
7.10.14	But whatever, whether speaking or not, he says to him, it is ceṛtain that it shall be accomplished. He should not, however, say anything save what is favourable to a Brāhmaṇa. Only in exceeding prosperity may he speak thus to a Brāhmaṇa. 'Not even in exceeding prosperity.
7.10.15	Let there be honour to Brāhmaṇas,' says Sauravīra Māṇḍukeya.
7.11.1	Then the reciters of the Nirbhuja say,
7.11.2	'The first syllable is the symbol of the former, the latter of the latter.
7.11.3	That which is between the letters y and v is the union.'
7.11.4	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.12.1	'Then we say, "we are reciters of the Nirbhuja,"' says Hrasva Māṇḍukeya,
7.12.2	'the first syllable is the symbol of the former, the latter of the latter.
7.12.3	The mora between the former and latter forms, that by which one makes diṣṭinct the Sandhi, that by which one diṣṭinguishes what is a mora and what is not, that by which one diṣṭinguishes accent from accent, that is the union.'
7.12.4	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.13.1	Then says his son Madhyama, the son of Prātibodhī, who lived in Magadha, 'The first syllable is the symbol of the former, the latter of the latter.
7.13.2	The mora which declares the Sandhi is the gliding. I recognise the gliding as the union.'
7.13.3-5	That is declared in a Ṛc: Give us not up to those who, foes in ambuscade, are greedy for the wealth of him who sits at ease, Who cherish in their heart abandonment of gods. Bṛhaspati, the Sāman is the highest known.'
7.13.6	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.14.1	'Speech is united with breath,' says Kauṇṭharavya,
7.14.2	'breath with the blowing (air), the blowing (air) with the all-gods, the all-gods with the world of heaven, the world of heaven with Brahman. This is the progressive union.'
7.14.3	He who knows thus this union, even so is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven, like this progressive union.
7.14.4	If, at the instigation of another or for his own sake, he recites, then in reciting he should know 'The union has gone to heaven; of him who knows the gods,' so will it be for his reciting.'
7.14.5	This, indeed, is it by this progress.
7.15.1	'The mother is the form of the former, the father of the latter. The child is the union,' says Bhāṛgava.
7.15.2	All that is declared to be one.
7.15.3	For the mother and the father and the child are this all.
7.15.4	This is the Aditi union.
7.15.5	For Aditi is this all, whatever this universe is.
7.15.6	This is declared in a Ṛc: 'Aditi is the heaven, Aditi atmosphere, Aditi is the mother, the father, and the son,
7.15.7	Aditi is all gods, Aditi the five races, Aditi all that hath been born and shall be born.'
7.15.8	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.16.1	'The wife is the symbol of the former, the husband of the latter. The son is the union, the seed the joining, the begetting the joiner,' says Sthavira Śākalya.
7.16.2	This is the Prajāpati union.
7.16.3	He who knows thus this union is increased with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.17.1	'Offspring is the symbol of the former, faith of the latter. Action is the union, truth the joiner,' says Kaśyapa.
7.17.2	This is the truth union.
7.17.3	They say the gods are of true unions.
7.17.4	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.18.1	'Speech is the union,' says Pañcālacanda.
7.18.2	By speech, indeed, the Vedas are united, by speech the metres, by speech he unites friends.
7.18.3-4	When he studies or speaks, then breath is in speech, then speech absorbs breath.
7.18.5	Again, when he sleeps or is silent, then speech is in breath, then breath absorbs speech; they absorb each other.
7.18.6	This is declared in a Ṛc: 'One of these birds hath passed into the sea of air; thence he looks round and views this universal world.
7.18.7-8	With simple heart I have beheld him close at hand; his mother him absorbs, and her he too absorbs.'
7.18.9	Speech, indeed, is the mother, breath the child.
7.18.10	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.19.1	'The union is made by the symbol of Bṛhat and Rathantara,' says Taṛksya.
7.19.2	Speech, indeed, is the symbol of the Rathantara, breath of the Bṛhat.
7.19.3	By both, indeed, is the union made, by speech and breath.
7.19.4	For the sake of this Upanisad one watches cows for a year,' says Taṛksya.
7.19.5	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.20.1	'Movement is the symbol of the former, stopping of the latter. Rest is the union,' says Jāratkārava Āṛtabhāga.
7.20.2	In this union there are united dhvaṃsis, nimeṣas, kāṣṭhās, seconds, minutes, hours, days and nights, half-months, months, seasons, and years.
7.20.3	This union unites these times;
7.20.4	time unites movement, stopping, and rest.
7.20.5	By movement, stopping, and rest, all this is united.
7.20.6	So far as regards the deities.
7.20.7	Now as regards the self. The past is the symbol of the former, the future of the latter. The present is the union. This is the time union.
7.20.8	This is declared in a Ṛc:— 'Great is that secret name, and far extending, whereby thou madest all present and future.
7.20.9-10	The light he loveth that was made aforetime, the five tribes whom he loveth well have entered.'
7.20.11	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.21.1	Then follows the saying of Vāliśikhāyani.
7.21.2	'There are, then, five gross elements,' says Vāliśikhāyani,
7.21.3	'the earth, wind, ether, water, light. These are united with each other.
7.21.4	Again, the others, the small ones, are united with the gross elements. This is the union of all elements.
7.21.5	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
7.22.1	'The whole of speech is Brahman,' says Lauhikya.
7.22.2	Whatever sounds there are, let him know to be speech.
7.22.3	This a Ṛṣi declares :— 'I with the Rudras and the Vasus fare.'
7.22.4	This speech is all sounds.
7.22.6	He who knows thus this union is united with children, cattle, glory, holiness, the world of heaven. He lives all his days.
8.1.1	Om. 'Breath is the beam,' says Sthavira Śākalya.
8.1.2	'Just as all the other beams rest on the main-beam, so the whole self rests on this breath.
8.1.3	Of this self breath is the symbol of the sibiḍānts, the bones of the mutes, the marrow of the vowels, the flesh and blood, the fourth element, of the semi-vowels.'
8.1.4	'But we have heard of a triad only,' says Hrasva Māṇḍukeya.
8.1.5	Of this triad, on one side there are three hundred and sixty joinings, on the other the same; these make up seven hundred and twenty.
8.1.6	Seven hundred and twenty, indeed, are the days and nights of the year.
8.1.7	Thus he obtains the days and nights of the year.
8.1.8	This is the self, commensurate with the year, composed of the eye, the ear, the metres, the mind, speech.
8.1.9	He who knows thus this self, commensurate with the year, composed of the eye, the ear, the metres, the mind, speech, wins union, and communion with the year, residence in the same world, and simiḍārity of form.
8.1.10	He becomes rich in sons and cattle. He lives all his days. So taught Āruṇikeya.
8.2.1	Then follows (the teaching of) Kauṇṭharavya.
8.2.2	There are three hundred and sixty letters,
8.2.3	three hundred and sixty sibiḍānts,
8.2.4	three hundred and sixty unions.
8.2.5	What we have called letters, they are the days.
8.2.6	What we have called sibiḍānts, they are the nights.
8.2.7	What we have called unions, they are the unions of days and nights.
8.2.8	So far as regards the deities.
8.2.9	Now as regards the self. What we have called letters as regards the deities, these are bones as regards the self.
8.2.10	What we have called sibiḍānts as regards the deities, these are marrow as regards the self.
8.2.11	This indeed is the chief breath, marrow. This is seed. Without breath, indeed, seed cannot be won.
8.2.12	If without breath seed were effused, it would decay, it would not be productive.
8.2.13	What we have called unions as regards the deities, these are joints as regards the self.
8.2.14	Of this triad, bones, marrow, joints, on this side there are five hundred and forty unions, on that side the same;
8.2.15	this makes a thousand and eighty.
8.2.16	One thousand and eighty Bṛhati verses the singers produce on this day as the (hymn of the) day.
8.2.17	This is the self, commensurate with the day, composed of the eye, the ear, the metres, the mind, speech.
8.2.18	He who knows thus this self, commensurate with the day, composed of the eye, the ear, the metres, the mind, speech, wins union and communion with the days, residence in the same world, and simiḍārity of form.
8.2.19	He becomes rich in cows and cattle. He lives all his days.
8.3.1	'There are four persons,' says Vātsya, 'the person of the body, the person of the metres, the person of the Vedas, the great person.'
8.3.2	What we have called the person of the body is the corporeal self. Of it the essence is this incorporeal intelligent self.
8.3.3	What we have called the person of the metres is the alphabet.
8.3.4	Of it the letter a is the essence.
8.3.5	What we have called the person of the Vedas is that by which one knows the Vedas, the Ṛgveda, the Yajurveda, the Sāmaveda. Of it the Brahman (n.) is the essence.
8.3.6	Therefore one should take as priest a Brahman priest fullest of Brahman, who can know the unusual in the sacrifice.
8.3.7	What we have called the great person is the year. Of it yonder sun is the essence.
8.3.8	The incorporeal intelligent self here and yonder sun are the same, so one should know.
8.3.9	This is declared in a Ṛc.—
8.4.1	'The brilliant presence of the gods has risen, the eye of Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni.
8.4.2-3	The soul of all that moveth not or moveth, the sun hath filled the air and earth and heaven.'
8.4.4	'Thus do I deem the union duly made,' says Vātsya. Him the BahvṚcas seek in the Mahad Uktha, him the Adhvaryus in the fire, him the Chandogas in the Mahāvrata, him on earth, him in the atmosphere, him in the heaven, him in the fire, him in the wind, him in the moon, him in the Nakṣatras, him in the waters, him in the plants, him in all beings, him in the letters, him they worship as Brahman.
8.4.5	This is declared in a Ṛc.-
8.5.1	'Looking upon the loftier light above the darkness we have come
8.5.2-3	To Sūrya, god among the gods, the light that is most excellent.'
8.5.4	This is the self, commensurate with the letters, composed of the eye, the ear, the metres, the mind, speech.
8.5.5-6	He who thus this self, commensurate with the letters, composed of the eye, the ear, the metres, the mind, speech, recites to another, his Vedas lose their savour, he has no part in speech, no part in what is studied.
8.5.7	This is declared in a Ṛc.—
8.6.1	'No part in speech hath he who hath abandoned his own dear friend who knows the truth of friendship.
8.6.2-3	Even if he hears him, still in vain he listens; naught knows he of the path of righteous action.'
8.6.4-5	In his study there is no part of speech, so he says. Therefore one should not recite (the litany of) that day for another, nor pile up the fire, nor celebrate the Mahāvrata, lest he be torn away from his self.
8.6.6	'This incorporeal self here and yonder sun are one,' we have said. When these two are seen apart,
8.7.1	The sun appears like the moon, its rays do not shine forth,
8.7.2	the sky is leaden like madder,
8.7.3	the anus is gaping,
8.7.4	'the self is on the point of death, it will not live long,' so one should know.
8.7.5	Whatever he considers should be done, he should do.
8.7.6-7	Again, if he sees himself in a mirror or water with a crooked head or without a head, or cannot see himself, he should know that it is so.
8.7.8	Again, if his shadow is pieṚced, or he throws no shadow, he should know that it is so.
8.7.9	Again, if the sun appears pieṚced like the nave of a chariot wheel, he should know that it is so.
8.7.10	Again, if the fire appears black like the neck of a peacock, or if amid a laṛge cloud he should see as it were brightness, or when there is no cloud see lightning,
8.7.11	or in cloudy weather see it not,
8.7.12	he should know that it is so.
8.7.13	Again, if closing his eyes he does not see motes, as it were, he should know that it is so.
8.7.14	Again, if he shut his ears and listen,
8.7.15	and does not then hear a noise as of burning fire or the sound of a chariot, he should know that it is so.
8.7.16	Again, if the pupils of the eyes appear inverted or doubly crooked, or cannot be seen, he should know that it is so.
8.7.17	'The unheard, unthought, unknown, unseen, undirected, soundless hearer, thinker, knower, seer, director, sounder, the inner self of all beings, he is my soul,' so should one know.
8.7.18	He departing enters into this incorporeal intelligent self, and abandons the other corporeal self.
8.7.19	This is the Upanisad of speech as a whole.
8.7.20-21	All these, indeed, are Upaniṣads of speech as a whole, but this one they call so especially.
8.8.1	The mutes are the form of earth, the sibiḍānts of the atmosphere, the vowels of the heaven.
8.8.2	The mutes are the form of Agni, the sibiḍānts of Vāyu, and the vowels of Āditya.
8.8.3	The mutes are the form of the Ṛgveda, the sibiḍānts of the Yajurveda, the vowels of the Sāmaveda.
8.8.4	The mutes are the form of the Rathantara, the sibiḍānts of the Vamadevya, the vowels of the Bṛhat.
8.8.5	The mutes are the form of expiration, the sibiḍānts of inspiration, the vowels of Vyāna.
8.8.6	The mutes are the form of expiration, the sibiḍānts of inspiration, the vowels of mind. 'The mutes are the form of expiration, the sibiḍānts of inspiration, the vowels of Udana,' says Punardatta.
8.8.7	He, indeed, knows speech as a whole who knows this.
8.9.1	Again, there is this divine lute. That human lute is an imitation of it.
8.9.2	As this has a sounding-boardand is tightly strung, so has that a sounding-board and is tightly strung.
8.9.3	As this has a head, so that has a head.
8.9.4	As this has a spine, so that has a bridge.
8.9.5	As this has a belly, so that has a cavity.
8.9.6	As this has mouth, nose, and eyes, so that has holes.
8.9.7	As this has joints, so that has finger-catches and covers.
8.9.8	As this has fingers, so that has strings.
8.9.9	As this has a tongue, so that has a sounder.
8.9.10	As this has sounds, so that has sounds.
8.9.11	As this is covered with a hairy skin, so that is covered with a hairy skin.
8.9.12	For with a hairy skin they used of old to cover lutes.
8.9.13	This is the divine lute.
8.9.14	He who knows thus this divine lute becomes exceedingly famous; his renown fills the earth; men hearken to him when he speaks in the assemblies, (saying), 'Let this be done which he desires.' Where Aryan speech is uttered they know him there.
8.10.1	Then follows the saying of Tandavindava.
8.10.2	As a lute struck by an unskilled player fulfils not the full purpose of a lute, so speech set in motion by an unskilled speaker fulfils not the full purpose of speech.
8.10.3	As a lute struck by a skilled player fulfils the full purpose of a lute, so speech set in motion by a skilled speaker fulfils the full purpose of speech.
8.10.4	'Of this lute the splendour is the union,' says the son of Kātyāyanī, Jātūkarṇya.
8.10.5	Now Kṛtsna Hārīta sets forth a Brāhmaṇa.
8.11.1	Prajāpati having created creatures fell to pieces. He united himself by means of the metres.
8.11.2	Because he united himself by means of the metres, there is the union.
8.11.3	Of this union the letter na is strength, the letter sa breath, the self the union.
8.11.4	As for this modification (in which gross are) combined with minute (elements), they are nails, hairs, consonants.
8.11.5	If he should be in doubt whether to say it with a na or without a na, let him say it with a na.
8.11.6	So if he should be in doubt whether to say it with a sa or without a sa, let him say it with the sa.
8.11.7	Knowing these two letters na and sa one should study the Ṛc verses according to the Saṃhitā text. Let him know that it is lifegiving.
8.11.8	Again, speech is the Itihāsapurāṇa, and whatever else there is of holy work; this should one study; let him know this also (to be lifegiving).
8.11.9	'In that we study the Ṛc verses according to the Saṃhitā and speak forth the recitation of Māṇḍukeya, so we secure the letters na and sa,' says Hrasva Māṇḍukeya.
8.11.10	Again, 'In that we study the Ṛc verses according to the Saṃhitā and learn the recitation, so we secure the letters na and sa,' says Sthavira Śākalya.
8.11.11	Knowing that the Kāvaṣeyas say, 'For what purpose shall we sacrifice, for what purpose shall we study ? For in speech we offer breath, in breath speech. The souṚce is also the scene of disappearance.'
8.11.12	' These Saṃhitās one should not proclaim to one who is not a pupil, who is not a pupil for a year, who is not a student, who is not a knower of the Vedas, who is not to be a teacher,' so say the teachers.
9.1.1	Om.
9.1.2-3	We crave of Savitṛ the god this treasure much to be enjoyed.
9.1.4-5	The best, all-yielding, conquering gift of Bhaga gladly we would win.
9.1.6-7	May we attain the excellent glory of Savitṛ the god:
9.1.8	So may he stimulate our prayers.
9.1.9-10	Mind undeceived, living eye, sun best of lights. Consecration harm me not.
9.2.1	He who knows the highest and best becomes highest and best among his own (people).
9.2.2	Breath indeed is the highest and best.
9.2.3	He who knows the most excellent becomes the most excellent among his own (people). 
9.2.4	He who knows the support finds support both in this world and in that. The eye indeed is support.
9.2.5	He who knows obtainment, his desires are obtained together for him. The ear indeed is obtainment.
9.2.6	He who knows the resort becomes the resort of his own (people). Mind indeed is the resort.
9.2.7	These deities approached Prajāpati and said, 'Who indeed is the best of us ?'
9.2.8	Prajāpati said, 'He is the best on whose departure the body considers itself worst as it were.'
9.3.1	Speech departed.
9.3.2	They were like dumb men, speechless, breathing with breath, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear, thinking with the mind.
9.4.1	Sight departed.
9.4.2	They were like blind men, sightless, breathing with breath, speaking with speech, hearing with the ear, thinking with the mind.
9.5.1	Hearing departed.
9.5.2	They were like deaf men, devoid of hearing, breathing with breath, speaking with speech, seeing with the eye, thinking with the mind.
9.6.1	Mind departed.
9.6.2	They were like infants, without mind, breathing with breath, speaking with speech, seeing with the eye, hearing with the ear.
9.7.1	Breath departed.
9.7.2	Then just as a fine steed from the Indus strains the pin of his hobbles,so he strained the breaths.
9.7.3	They assembled and said, 'Lord, depart not.'
9.7.4	Breath said, 'What will be my food ?'
9.7.5	'All there is up to dogs, up to birds.'
9.7.6	'What will be my clothing ?' 'The waters,' they replied.
9.7.7	Therefore a man about to eat purifies himself before and after with water.
9.7.8	He is eager to take his clothing, for he is not naked.
9.7.9	This Satyakāma Jābala declared to Gośruta Vaiyāghrapādya and said,
9.7.10	'If one declared this to a dry stump, there would arise from it branches, there would spring up blossoms.'
9.7.11	'Spring forth, tree, with a hundred blossoms. Harm not the sky, harm not the atmosphere,' says Yājñavālkya.
9.8.1	Now if one desires to obtain something impoṛtant, after consecrating himself for three nights, on the night of new moon, having mixed with curds and honey a mess of all sorts of herbs, having built up the fire, having swept (the place of sacrifice), having scattered (grass) about, having sprinkled water, bending the right knee, he places the mess in a vessel to the north of the fire, sacrifices, and pours into the mess the remainder of the oblation.
9.8.2	'Svadhā to the highest and best,' (with these words) having sacrificed in the fire, he should pour the rest into the mess.
9.8.3	'Svadhā to support,' (with these words) having sacrificed in the fire, he should pour the rest into the mess.
9.8.4	'Svadhā to obtainment,' (with these words) having sacrificed in the fire, he should pour the rest into the mess.
9.8.5	Having eaten, (repeating) by quarter-verses ' We crave of Savitṛ,' he sips, (repeating) by quarter-verses 'The excellent (glory) of Savitṛ,' the fourth being accompanied by the Vyāhṛtis. Then he washes the vessel and goes to rest on a skin or on the bare ground.
9.8.6	If he sees a woman, he should know that his rite is successful.
10.1.1-2	Then follows the internal Agnihotṛa relating to the self. So they describe it.
10.1.3	These deities, indeed, are established in man; fire in speech, wind in breath, sun in the eye, moon in the mind, the quarters in the ear, the waters in the seed.
10.1.4	In all of these is offering made by him who knowing this eats and drinks and makes to eat and drink.
10.1.5	He eats, he drinks, he delights, he causes delight.
10.2.1	He delighted delights speech,
10.2.2	speech delighted delights fire,
10.2.3	fire delighted delights earth,
10.2.4	earth delighted whatever is covered by earth. Present, future, past, all that he delights,
10.2.5	who knowing this eats and drinks and makes to eat and drink. He eats, he drinks, he delights, he causes delight.
10.3.1	He delighted delights breath,
10.3.2	breath delighted delights wind,
10.3.3	wind delighted delights ether,
10.3.4	ether delighted all that is covered by ether. Present, future, past, all that he delights,
10.3.5	who knowing this eats and drinks and makes to eat and drink. He eats, he drinks, he delights, he causes delight.
10.4.1	He delighted delights the eye,
10.4.2	the eye delighted delights the sun,
10.4.3	the sun delighted delights the sky, the sky delighted whatever is covered by the sky. Present, future, past, all that he delights,
10.4.4	who knowing this eats and drinks and makes to eat and drink. He eats, he drinks, he delights, he causes delight.
10.5.1	He delighted delights the mind,
10.5.2	the mind delighted delights the moon,
10.5.3	the moon delighted delights the Nakṣatras,
10.5.4	the Nakṣatras delighted delight the months,
10.5.5	the months delighted delight the half-months,
10.5.6	the half-months delighted delight the days and nights,
10.5.7	the days and nights delighted delight the seasons,
10.5.8	the seasons delighted delight the year,
10.5.9	the year delighted whatever is covered by the year. Present, future, past, all that he delights,
10.5.10	who knowing this eats and drinks and makes to eat and drink. He eats, he drinks, he delights, he causes delight.
10.6.1	He delighted delights the ear,
10.6.2	the ear delighted delights the quarters,
10.6.3	the quarters delighted delight the intermediate quarters,
10.6.4	the intermediate quarters what is covered by the intermediate quarters. Present, future, past, all that he delights,
10.6.5	who knowing this eats and drinks and makes to eat and drink. He eats, he drinks, he delights, he causes delight.
10.7.1	He delighted delights seed,
10.7.2	seed delighted delights the waters,
10.7.3	the waters delighted delight the rivers,
10.7.4	the rivers delighted delight the ocean,
10.7.5	the ocean delighted whatever is covered by the ocean. Present, future, past, all that he delights,
10.7.6	who knowing this eats and drinks and makes to eat and drink. He eats, he drinks, he delights, he causes delight.
10.8.1	He delighted is the tenfold, Virāj-like, Agnihotṛa.
10.8.2	His expiration is the Āhāvaniya (fire),
10.8.3	his inspiration the Gārhapatya, his Vyāna the Anvāhāryapacana, his mind the smoke, his anger the flame, his teeth the coals, his faith the milk, his speech the brand, his truth the oblation, his intelligent self the essence.
10.8.4	That Virāj-like, tenfold, Agnihotṛa is offered.
10.8.5	Him it sends to the world of heaven, which is mounted by these two ascents, who knowing this eats and drinks and makes to eat and drink.
10.8.6	Now if one, knowing not this Agnihotṛa, sacrifices, it is with him as though he pushed aside the coals and made oblation in the ashes.
11.1.1	Prajāpati elevated this person.
11.1.2	In him he made these deities to dwell, in his speech fire, in his expiration wind, in his inspiration the lightning, in his Udana Parjanya, in his eye the sun, in his mind the moon, in his ear the quarters, in his body the earth, in his seed the waters, in his strength Indra, in his anger Iśāna, in his head the ether, in his self Brahman (n.).
11.1.3	As a great jar of ambrosia stands swelling, so he stood.
11.1.4	Then these deities considered, 'What shall this person do with us, or what we with him?
11.1.5	Come, let us depart from the body.'
11.1.6	They departed.
11.1.7	Then this body was, as it were empty, and perforated on all sides. Prajāpati reflected, 'The body is not capable of standing these gaps.
11.1.8	Come, I will vex them with hunger and thirst.'
11.1.9	Them he vexed;
11.1.10	they, being vexed and finding no joy, again entered this person.
11.2.1	(Saying), 'Speech is mine,' fire entered.
11.2.2	(Saying), 'Expiration is mine,' wind entered.
11.2.3	(Saying), 'Inspiration is mine,' lightning entered.
11.2.4	(Saying), 'The Udana is mine,' Parjanya entered.
11.2.5	(Saying), 'The eye is mine,' the sun entered.
11.2.6	(Saying), 'The mind is mine,' the moon entered.
11.2.7	(Saying), 'The ear is ours,' the quarters entered.
11.2.8	(Saying), 'The body is mine,' the earth entered.
11.2.9	(Saying), 'The seed is ours,' the waters entered.
11.2.10	(Saying), 'The strength is mine,' Indra entered.
11.2.11	(Saying), 'Anger is mine,' Iśāna entered.
11.2.12	(Saying), 'The head is mine,' the ether entered.
11.2.13	(Saying), 'The self is mine,' Brahman entered.
11.2.14	As a great green tree stands with its roots moistened, so he stood.
11.3.1	Now a man when he is to die before the year's end, sees visions of the year.
11.3.2	His shadow is crooked, or is not seen at all.
11.3.3	He may see either light, as it were, in a great cloud or lightning without a cloud, or not see lightning in a cloud.
11.3.4	Closing his eyes he does not see motes, as it were.
11.3.5	Or closing his ears he does not hear a noise, as it were.
11.3.6	He has no joy in this world; his mind pleases him not.
11.3.7	These are the waking visions.
11.4.1	Then follow the dream visions.
11.4.2	He sees a black man with black teeth. He kills him, a boar kills him, a monkey kills him. He devours stalks; having devoured them he spits them forth. He carries a single lotus. Wearing a wreath of spikenard, he drives towards the south a cow with its calf.
11.4.3	If he sees any of the following things, a yellow-looking or black woman, with loosened hair, or shaved, anointing with sesamum oil, a garment dyed with safflower, singing, a buffalo carriage, going to the south, etc., having looked at them he fasts, cooks milk in a pot, using the milk of a cow which has a calf like itself, but on no account of a black cow, piles up the fire, sweeps out (the place of sacrifice), scatters grass, sprinkles water around, and, bending the right knee, offers oblations of ghee by means of a ladle.
11.5.1	'In my speech rests fire, svaḥa.
11.5.2	In my expiration rests wind, svaḥa.
11.5.3	In my inspiration rests the lightning, svaḥa.
11.5.4	In my Udana rests Parjanya, svaḥa.
11.5.5	In my eye rests the sun, svaḥa.
11.5.6	In my mind rests the moon, svaḥa.
11.5.7	In my ear rest the quarters, svaḥa.
11.5.8	In my body rests the earth, svaḥa.
11.5.9	In my seed rest the waters, svaḥa.
11.5.10	In my strength rests Indra, svaḥa.
11.5.11	In my anger rests Iśāna, svaḥa.
11.5.12	In my head rests the ether, svaḥa.
11.5.13	In my self rests Brahman (n.), svaḥa,'
11.5.14	(he repeats), and then pouring the remainder of the ghee into the pot of milk he offers the pot of milk, ladling it out.
11.6.1	'In my speech rests fire, speech in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities. I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.2	In my expiration rests wind, expiration in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities. I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.3	In my inspiration rests the lightning, inspiration in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities. I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.4	In my Udana rests Parjanya, Udana in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities. I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.5	In my eye rests the sun, the eye in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities. I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.6	In my mind rests the moon, mind in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities. I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.7	In my ear rest the quarters, the ear in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities. I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.8	In my body rests the earth, the body in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities. I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.9	In my strength rests Indra, strength in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities. I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.10	In my anger rests Iśāna, anger in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities. I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.11	In my head rests the ether, the head in the heart, the heart in the self. That is the truth of the deities, I shall not die against my will. May I be rich in food, an eater of food, svaḥa.
11.6.12	In my self rests Brahman (n.), the self in the heart, svaḥa,'
11.6.13	(he repeats), and sacrifices by consuming the remains of the pot of milk.
12.1.1	Om. May that splendour of the elephant, of great power, manifest itself which was born from Aditi's body. That all those have given to me, the Ādityas in unison with Aditi.
12.1.2	The great splendour that is deposited in thee, Jātavedas, with that splendour do thou make me resplendent.
12.1.3	The splendour that is in man, that is deposited in elephants, the splendour in gold and kine, in me be that splendour of the elephant.
12.1.4	The glory that there is in golden dice, in cows and horses, in the Sura being purified, in me be that splendour of the elephant.
12.1.5	In me be radiance, in me greatness, in me the glory of the sacrifice, in me may Prajāpati make that fast as the heaven in the sky.
12.2.1	May the Aśvins anoint me with the honey of bees, with milk, that a honey-sweet voice I may utter among the folk.
12.2.2	Snatched out of ghee, rich in honey and milk, winning wealth, bearing and supporting, destroying our foes and putting them down, mount upon me for great good fortune.
12.2.3	None other than thou, Prajāpati, doth enciṚcle all these beings. That for which we long in sacrificing to thee, be that ours. May we be lords of riches.
12.2.4	May this ancient (amulet) crush my foes, even as Indra Vṛtra, enduring in the battles. As Agni a forest, spread widely, so in the winds the sharp-toothed one rubs me.
12.2.5	This ancient one who accords with us in sooth, as Indra Vṛtra, has rent the buṛghs asunder. With this, Indra, smiting aside the foes, bring us the wealth of the hostile ones.
12.3.1	Conquer the foes, conquer, hero, the enemy. Slaying Vṛtra, cleave him with thine axe. Like the flood pieces of wood, let him smite away our foes, and lay low our enemies as an axe the woods.
12.3.2	Cleave along from the middle, cleave forward from above, cleave from behind, cleave, O hero; the foes smitten by thee, bountiful one, hero, let the Maruts follow thee as thou destroyest.
12.3.3	Thee swelling with Rudra's darts, deeming thee Indra, let the Maruts gladly choose. Let the vultures and herons seize on them (the foes). May the tusker be joyous in the increase.
12.3.4	bountiful one, may thy blows fall on all sides on the enemy smitten by the spell. May they own no friend, no support. Mutually hindering they go to death.
12.3.5	O glorious Agni, bring us to glory. Bring hither Indra's recompense. May he be the head, the supreme, the splendid, of his kinsmen may he have the highest praise.
12.4.1	With auspicious glances they have sat down. The Ṛṣis who know heaven have come to the consecration. Then were heroism, strength, and might born. May this the gods to him make obedient.
12.4.2	Creator, disposer, highest seer, Prajāpati, the supreme, the splendid. The Stomas, the metres, the Nivids mine they call. To him may they make the kingdom obedient.
12.4.3	Approach hither, pay him honour. Let Agni be our ruler and our king. Be ye in accordance with his will. On him hereafter do ye all depend.
12.4.4	Thou art born, Alarda by name, before the sun, before the dawn. I know thee as destroyer of my enemies, and overthrower of their supports.
12.4.5	He will not be cut off in the midst (of life), he will oveṚcome his foe, he will be skilled in speech, he will be strong against battles, his foe they call likely to perish, who bears a comforting amulet of Bilva.
12.5.1	He eats not accursed food, he commits no sin, the heavenly Varuṇa terrifies him not, nor slays him, wrath oveṚcomes him not in anger, who bears a comforting amulet of Bilva.
12.5.2	Jātavedas injures not his skin. He eats not flesh nor harms these (creatures). After a hundred (years of life), reaching old age, in this world, he departs, who bears a comforting amulet of Bilva.
12.5.3	No offspring of his is harmed in birth, no robber, no evil deed is there, nothing else amiss happens in his families, who bears a comforting amulet of Bilva.
12.5.4	In his house there are no reviling nor scolding women, nor those who quarrel. Misfortune comes not to him, nor does she fix her abode in him, who bears a comforting amulet of Bilva.
12.5.5	Him neither Rakṣas nor Pisaca injures, nor Jambhaka, nor Asura, nor Yaksa. In his house there is no lying-in woman, who bears a comforting amulet of Bilva.
12.6.1	Him neither tiger, nor wolf, nor panther, nor beast of prey whatsoever hurts. No angry elephant meets he to scare him, who bears a comforting amulet of Bilva.
12.6.2	No serpent, nor viper, nor scorpion, nor striped one, nor black one injures him, who bears a comforting amulet of Bilva.
12.6.3	He sins not so that Varuṇa harms him; no crocodile, nor shark, nor porpoise injures him; on all sides it makes peace for him, who bears a comforting amulet of Bilva.
12.6.4	They say his foe is likely to perish, like a flower fallen from its stalk. Like the flood pieces of wood, he shall oveṚcome his foes, who bears a comforting amulet of Bilva.
12.6.5	This amulet, the reverter, of the Jamba, is tied on for the sake of life. By it Indra slew Vṛtra, and by the help of the wise Ṛṣi.
12.7.1	OveṚcome, Indra, our foes, oveṚcome our enemies, oveṚcome the warriors; like an elephant (?) with its fore-feet, outmatch the warriors.
12.7.2	Here has come the amulet of Bilva, the strong subduer of foes. The Ṛṣis, all heroic, behold it that they may oveṚcome their foes in the battle.
12.7.3	Ambrosia is the thread in this amulet. May the Aśvins fasten (the thread). Thou art of the Bilva, of a thousand powers. May I that bear thee never be injured.
12.7.4	Snatched out of ghee, rich in honey and milk, winning wealth, bearing and supporting, destroying our foes and putting them down, mount upon me for great good fortune.
12.7.5	None other than thou (Prajāpati) doth enciṚcle all these beings. That for which we long in sacrificing to thee, be that ours. May we be lords of riches.
12.7.6	Then come five verses, (beginning), 'Thou art the great ruler here.'
12.8.1	Then follows the ritual of the amulet.
12.8.2-3	A man who desires prosperity should fast on flowers for three nights, then taking a piece from a living elephant's tusk, he should pile up the fire, sweep out (the place of sacrifice), scatter grass, sprinkle water around, and bending his right knee, place the amulet in a vessel to the north of the fire, sacrifice, and pour upon the amulet the remnant from the oblation, to the accompaniment of the eight verses (vv. 1-8), beginning 'Splendour of the elephant,' verse by verse. Then for seven nights, or three nights, or one he should leave it to stand in honey and ghee and then put it on, with the verse (v. 7) 'Snatched out of ghee.'
12.8.4	Then next with six (vv. 9-14) he should put on, having left it to stand for three nights or one in (a mess of) meat and boiled rice, an amulet of the point of the heart-spit or the point of the goad or the point of the moṛtar or of the core of the Acacia catechu.
12.8.5	Then next with four verses (vv. 15-18) he should put on an amulet of the point of a bull's horn, having left it to stand for three nights or one in (a mess of) ghee and boiled rice.
12.8.6	Then next with one verse (v. 19) he should put on an amulet of the castor-oil plant, having left it to stand for three nights or one in (a mess of) sesamum and boiled rice.
12.8.7	Then next with sixteen verses (vv. 20-35) he should put on an amulet of Bilva, having left it to stand for seven nights or three or one in honey and ghee, fastening it with the verse (v. 34) 'Snatched out of ghee.'
12.8.8	Then with the next five (vv. 36-40) verses he should bind on a splinter of the Ficus infectoria which he has left to stand for three nights or one in a (mess of) beans and boiled rice. If possible he should first sacrifice in the shadow of an elephant or on a tiger's skin or sitting.
13.1.1	Then when his body has been made prepared for indifference to desire, he should be bent on the Brahman offering.
13.1.2	So he drives repeated death away.
13.1.3	'The self is to be seen, to be heard, to be thought, to be meditated on,'
13.1.4	'Him they seek to know by repeating the Vedas, by studentship, by asceticism, by faith, by sacrifice, by fasting,' says Māṇḍukeya.
13.1.5	'Therefore, he who knows this, calm, restrained, still, enduring, becoming full of faith, should see the self in the self,' says Māṇḍavya.
13.1.6	'"The person among the breath composed of knowledge is incomprehensible, to be diṣṭinguished as 'No, no.' This self is the warrior-class, this the priesthood, this the gods, this the Vedas, this the worlds, this all beings, this is all.'
13.1.7	This is 'That art thou.' The self is to be recognised in 'I am Brahman.'
13.1.8	This Brahman, without predecessor, without superior, without other, immediate, without an exterior, is this self, Brahman (n.), all-experiencing," such is the teaching,' says Yājñavālkya.
13.1.9	'That one should not proclaim to one who is not a son or a pupil.'
13.1.10	'Were a man to offer this earth surrounded by water and filled with wealth, yet is this more than that, more than that,' is the teaching.
13.1.11	This Upanisad he should declare to be the head of the Veda in very truth.
13.1.12	This is declared in a Ṛc:-
14.1.1	'Head of the Ṛc verses, highest member of the Yajus verses, pinnacle of the Sāmans, the supreme tonsure of the Atharvans,
14.1.2	he who studies not the Veda, him they call ignorant. Cleaving his head, he makes himself a corpse.
14.2.1	'He is but a pillar indeed who bears a burden,
14.2.2	who repeats the Veda without knowing the meaning.
14.2.3	Who knows the meaning alone wins prosperity.
14.2.4	He goes to heaven, shaking off sin through knowledge.'
15.1.1	Then follows the line of teachers.
15.1.2	Honour to Brahman, honour to the teachers!
15.1.3	We have learnt it from Gunakhya Sankhayana,
15.1.4	Gunakhya Sankhayana from Kahola Kauṣitaki,
15.1.5	Kahola Kauṣitaki from Uddalaka Āruṇi,

1.1.1	Prajapati is the year.
1.1.2	This is his self, namely the Mahavrata.
1.1.3	Therefore one should not recite it for another, lest one should place one's own self in another of all beings.
1.1.4	And this is Indra's self, namely the Mahāvrata.
1.1.5	One should not recite it to another, lest one place Indra's self in another.
1.1.6	Now, indeed, that person which they make out of the Rg, Yajus, and Sama, his self is this Great Vrata.
1.1.7	Therefore one should not recite it for another, lest one should place one's own self in the other.
1.1.8	But the Hotri may recite it for the sacrificers.
1.1.9	Or for his father, or for his teacher, or for himself. That is proper for him.
1.1.10	He himself makes that sacrifice prosper.
1.1.11	Its Stoma is twenty-five.
1.1.12	Twenty-four indeed are the half-months of the year; for the attainment of the year.
1.1.13	And indeed Prajapati is the twenty-five year.
1.1.14	And the twenty-four has been made before; this is its course, that it is twenty-five.
1.2.3	In that (Agni) there are two metres, the Gāyatrī and the Anushtubh.
1.2.4	He praises the hymn consisting of twenty-five verses beginning with "Agni, men with rays, on the kindling wood".
1.2.5	For the Stoma is twenty-five.
1.2.6	That indeed is the perfect instrument when it is accomplished by the Stoma.
1.2.7	In that (Agni), there are two metres: the Viraj and the Tristubh.
1.2.8	And those four are accomplished.
1.2.9	And this fourfold (universe) is all his, for the attainment of all.
1.2.10	The Prauga is in Tristubh.
1.2.11	This is Indra's metre, namely the Tristubh. He thus makes him prosper with his own metre.
1.2.12	"O Indra, by whom, by whom, O Indra, by whom art thou worshipped?"
1.2.13	The Vayu hymn is great and prosperous.
1.2.14	The day is great, for this day is great.
1.2.15	Therefore the third verse is for Indra-Vayu, as far as the strength of the body, as far as power, as far as man, looking with the eye. In this form.
1.2.16	The verse "May your eye, O Varuna, be well-directed" is for Mitra-Varuna. The sun moves towards the gods. In this form.
1.2.17	Who is the hearer? Which one of the sacrificers? The Asvin (rite) is the one whom the daughter of the Sun chooses. In this form.
1.2.18	How did the great one grow? Of which Hotri? The Indra (rite) is great, growing.
1.2.19	Great, because this day is great.
1.2.20	Who is the protector? Which Vasus? Who is the protector? The Vaishvadev (rite) is more powerful than Varuna, Mitra, and Death. In this form.
1.2.21	"May Sarasvati be pleased with us." This is the Sarasvati-verse. "O auspicious one, through this form, do thou turn away from the door of truth."
1.2.22	This is indeed the Kadva verse, the Tristubh verse, the Vamadevya Prauga.
1.2.23	Prajapati is indeed Vamadeva. In him they obtain all desires.
1.3.2	This is the song of Vasu, sung by the blind one, the follower.
1.3.3	This alone is always sung in one day.
1.3.4	Its Brāhmaṇa has been recited.
1.3.5	Having praised Vasu first, "May my praise be true, O Jariṭa, with force," then Indra, the great one, praises him in the Tristubh metre, "Like a man, like a warrior."
1.3.6	The reason why he praises Vasu first,
1.3.7	Indra indeed is Vasu-kr.
1.3.8	And as to why it is said, 'The great Indra, like a man, the leader of men,' it is because of greatness.
1.3.9	For this day is great.
1.4.1	Then he offers these oblations of ghee.
1.4.2	He thus makes it a means of well-being.
1.4.3	For the peace of the sacrifice and for the healing of the sacrificers.
1.4.4	They are eight in number.
1.4.5	By these (verses) the gods attained all the worlds.
1.4.6	In the same way the sacrificer attains all the worlds by these (verses).
1.4.7	Then he recites these verses of Parimādas.
1.4.8	Parimādas are indeed the waters.
1.4.9	For everything here is filled with water.
1.4.10	And indeed Parimādas are
1.4.11	This is the praise of food.
1.4.12	The waters are the source of food, they come first.
1.4.13	The waters are the limit.
1.4.14	And indeed the limit is the nails, teeth, skin, and hair.
1.4.15	Therefore the rites are successful, for they are endowed with prosperity.
1.4.16	The twenty-five is the final verse.
1.4.17	The Angirasa is for stability.
1.4.18	That is the form.
1.4.19	The Sama is the Bhutat Chhanda.
1.4.20	He approached the beloved abode of Indra.
1.4.21	A Krośa and an Anukrośa.
1.4.22	The Araṭsus.
1.4.23	Even their milk.
1.4.24	The Arațsus.
1.4.25	The Arka and the Arka-flower.
1.4.26	This Agni is the Arka.
1.4.27	This Aditya is the Arka-flower
1.4.28	When the Sāman-singers sing in turn among them, then they say to the Hotr, "Recite after (us)."
1.4.29	If they were to sing, then he would recite after (them).
1.5.7	For the gods do not exceed in paying homage.
1.5.8	One should attend to these parts of the fire only if it is the northern Veda.
1.5.9	Then, standing here itself, one attends to the sun.
1.5.10	Some say that they should make the sky the hall.
1.5.11	But one should attend to it by means of the country.
1.5.12	Now this (Agni) is hidden in the highest praise, he speaks of the highest blessing, 'The great one has placed himself with the great one.'
1.5.13	Agni is the great one, this earth is the great one.
1.5.14	For these two have placed themselves together.
1.5.15	'The god has placed himself with his goddess,' he says.
1.5.16	Vayu is the god, the sky is the goddess.
1.5.17	For these have placed themselves together,
1.5.18	'Brahma has placed himself with Brahmani,' he says.
1.5.19	This sun is Brahma, this heaven is the Brahmani.
1.5.20	For these two have created it.
1.5.21	He thus establishes these worlds. This eulogy will be sung.
1.6.1	Vishvamitra indeed approached Indra's beloved abode by means of his weapon and observance of vows.
1.6.2	Indra then said to him, "Vishvamitra, choose a boon."
1.6.3	He said, "I should know you."
1.6.4	"The second."
1.6.5	"You."
1.6.6	"The third."
1.6.7	"You."
1.6.8	Then Indra said to him, "I am great and great am I.
1.6.9	I am a god and a goddess am I.
1.6.10	Brahma and Brahmani am I."
1.6.11	Then indeed, Visvamitra became curious.
1.6.12	Indra said to him, "This is what I am, what I have said, and what the sage has said. What is more, I am that. What is that? I am."
1.6.13	Indra spoke the Vyahrtis. They became the Upanishads.
1.6.14	Then, having placed the Prangkha wood-piece, he recited three times, and sprinkled three times.
1.7.1	It is made of Udumbara wood.
1.7.2	Udumbara is food and nourishment; for the attainment of food and nourishment.
1.7.3	Then, touching it with his chest and taking the right part of his body, he murmurs: "You are the sun, you are the Vasus. May the Gayatri metre ascend you. Those are your ascendants." Thus he says.
1.7.4	I ascend them for the kingdom."
1.7.5	Indeed, this kingdom is seen to be here.
1.7.6	Then, taking the northern part of himself, he recites, "May Rudras ascend you with the Tristubh metre. They are the ascenders." Thus he says.
1.7.7	"I ascend them for self-sovereignty."
1.7.8	Self-sovereignty is indeed higher than the kingdom.
1.7.9	Then, taking the right side of himself, he recites: "May the Adityas ascend you with the Jāgata metre. They are the ascenders." He says this.
1.7.10	"I ascend them for sovereignty."
1.7.11	Sovereignty is indeed higher than self-sovereignty.
1.7.12	Then, taking the northern part of himself, he recites (the verse), "May all the gods, with the Anushtubh metre, ascend you. They are your ascenders." He says this indeed.
1.7.13	"I ascend them, for the sake of desire."
1.7.14	Indeed, the desire is the most desirable of all.
1.7.15	Then, having moved forward, having placed the feet facing east, he places them on the ground.
1.7.16	He who is raised up is indeed higher than this world.
1.7.17	When he establishes it, he establishes himself in this world, in the state of stability, without falling.
1.7.18	Then three times he recites, "I am the one who is raised up, I am the one who has been raised up."
1.7.19	Then, having placed the upper plank in a north-south direction, he touches the western end of the upper plank with his right hand.
1.7.20	"May Prajapati ascend, may Vayu shake."
1.7.21	Prajapati indeed ascends, Vayu shakes, what is living.
1.7.22	Then he recites three times, "May I be united with the three."
1.7.23	Then, holding his hands towards the east, he recites:
1.8.1	"May speech be united with breath, may I be united with breath; may sight be united with mind, may I be unite with mind; may Prajapati be united with animals, may I be unites with animals." He is indeed speaking a benediction.
1.8.2	"You are the bird Garuda."
1.8.3	Breath indeed is the bird Garuda.
1.8.4	"He speaks this speech, saying, 'I shall speak this speech.' He speaks this speech, thinking, 'I shall do much.' This speech does much.
1.8.5	This speech does much. This speech does much."
1.8.6	He who attains the weapon of this day does much.
1.8.7	"He who is going to perform the Bahorbhūya sacrifice, he who is going to do the Bahorbhüya sacrifice, he is going to do Bahorbhūyâ sacrifice. This speech is going to do a Bahorbhūyā sacrifice. He who obtains the Bahorbhûya sacrifice, he does the Bahorbhůya sacrifice."
1.8.8	"She is going to heaven, he is going to heaven." The speech of this (day) is going to heaven. He who attains the rite of this day goes to heaven.
1.8.9	One should say, "He is going to heaven to these sacrificers."
1.8.10	One should say of him whom one hates, "Not him, not him."
1.8.11	He (the Adhvaryu) shakes it as many times as he counts from this divine chariot. He shakes it out.
1.8.12	They do not become fit for enjoyment.
1.8.13	He thus frightens him.
1.8.14	He thus makes him enter himself.
1.8.15	This is the wind, having become the breath, he praises this hymn.
1.8.16	He thus terrifies him.
1.8.17	He thus makes it his own by overcoming it.
1.8.18	He who obtains the weapon on this day is fit to be a teacher. If the teacher is fit, the lord of the teacher is the vital breath. If he is not conquered,
1.8.19	he overcomes it.
1.8.20	He thus makes it his by overcoming it.
1.8.21	For this deity there is no obstacle, whether by a poisoned arrow, a sword, an axe, or by anything else.
1.8.22	He who reviles one who knows this becomes worse.
1.8.23	He who knows this does not become worse.
1.8.24	There is no obstacle for one who knows this, there is no obstacle for him who knows this.
2.1.1	The praise is accepted by the word "hiṃkāra".
2.1.2	Prāṇa is the Hiṃkāra. By Prāṇa he attains the Uktha.
2.1.3	Hiṃkāra is indeed strength and juice. He thus places strength and juice in this Uktha.
2.1.4	Moreover, Hiṃkāra is immortality. He thus places immortality in himself.
2.1.5	The Rājanam is the Prstha.
2.1.6	This is indeed the direct Sāman, namely, the Rājanam.
2.1.7-14	He thus makes it prosper with his own speech. It is recited in the Anirukta (Sutra). Prajapati is indeed Anirukta. That is the form of Prajapati. Some say that it should be in the Kavati (Sutra). What is Prajapati? That is the Prajapati form. Then he recites this silent praise in a low voice.
2.1.15	Speech is this day, silence is the chanting.
2.1.16	He makes speech prosper by means of mind.
2.1.17	"It was the best in the worlds." This is the Stotriya verse.
2.1.18	"He has grown by strength, the mighty one." This is the Vridhavat verse.
2.1.19	This day is indeed great.
2.1.20	This is the twenty-fivefold Self.
2.1.21	He recites it with the word 'river'.
2.1.22	The Self is twenty-five, the beings are the animals, the river is the calamity.
2.1.23	He thus makes the Self approach with beings and animals, with food and drink.
2.1.24	He makes the earlier verses in the Tristubh metre, and the later ones in the Nadastobha metre.
2.1.25	With the first Tristubh verse, he joins the first part of the river and then flows.
2.1.26	With the second Tristubh verse he joins the second part and flows.
2.1.27	With third Tristubh verse joins the third part and then flows. With the fourth Tristubh verse
2.1.28	he joins the fourth part and then flows.
2.1.29	Thus he recites the first three times, the later ones in the reverse order. Thus he recites them.
2.1.30	He omits the second half of the third verse of the Sukta and the second half of Nadasi.
2.1.31	This is the opening of the mouth. Through this he speaks. One speaks through the mouth.
2.1.32-34	He recites them first among the bipeds. Thus his Stotriya is not interrupted. Having praised himself, he then recites the Soodadoha. The joints become connected. The Soodadoha is indeed the waters. By the waters these joints become connected. The Soodadoha indeed is immortality. He thus places immortality in himself.
2.1.35	Now the Sūdadohā is the form of the Avāsyā.
2.1.36	Just as a piece of wood, when it is heated, becomes pliable and can be bent, so the Sūdadohās are the binder of all the Vedas.
2.2.1	Then he recites these Shirsnyas.
2.2.2	They are three verses.
2.2.3	There are three skull-bones on his head.
2.2.4	He thus unites them with these (verses).
2.2.5	Those three again are each divided into three, making nine verses.
2.2.6	There are nine vital airs in the head.
2.2.7	They are with Arkas.
2.2.8	That is the form of this day.
2.3.1	Then he recites this Graiva (verse).
2.3.2	There are three verses.
2.3.3	There is a junction of three necks.
2.3.4	He thus joins them together with these (verses).
2.3.5	The Uṣṇīṣ is the last (verse).
2.3.6	This is the Skandhas, the Vidyut, the Avūḍha.
2.4.1	Then he recites this verse:
2.4.2	It is a Tristubh verse.
2.4.3	Therefore the Akṣa is the largest.
2.4.4	"Thy arms, O Indra, are strong, O mighty one," (is a verse) corresponding to the arms.
2.4.5	Then he chants the Anurūpa verses of the Rathantara Stotriya.
2.4.6	The Brahmanical text has been recited in regard to them.
2.4.7	Then he recites the Dhayyā verse.
2.4.8	This (earth) is the Dhayyā.
2.4.9	For this one is beneficial to all beings.
2.4.10	It is placed on the right side.
2.4.11	Therefore a woman lies on the right side of a man.
2.4.12	Then he chants the Rathantara Prastara.
2.4.13	The Brahmanical text has already been recited in regard of it.
2.4.14	He is the one who is to be worshipped by the leaders. This is the verse. It is recited at the end.
2.4.15	Having recited the second verse, "All others have gone to the king of enemies,"
2.4.16	He makes the second verse here.
2.4.17	He places these two wings in a crosswise position for non-separation.
2.4.18	Therefore, he enjoys all the rites with these two wings.
2.5.1	Then he recites this Prahasta hymn.
2.5.2	There are three verses in it.
2.5.3	There are indeed three joints in his hand.
2.5.4	He joins them with these (verses).
2.5.5	The first is the Atichandas, and this is the thumb.
2.5.6	Therefore this thumb is the most important of all fingers.
2.5.7	The right wing is the Rathantara.
2.5.8	Or the northern wing is the Brāhmaṇa.
2.5.9	This is said to be the Brāhmaṇas.
2.5.10	These two wings are the Brāhma and the Atharva, each consisting of twenty-four verses.
2.5.11	There are twenty-four half-months in a year, for the attainment of the year.
2.6.1	Then he recites these four additional verses, following the sequence.
2.6.2	They become twenty-one verses.
2.6.3	There are twenty-one joints in the neck.
2.6.4	He joins them with these (verses).
2.6.5	They consist of seven triṣṭubh verses.
2.6.6	There are seven metres; for the attainment of all metres.
2.6.7	They have Arkas (verses).
2.6.8	That is the form of this day.
2.7.1	Then he recites these eighty verses.
2.7.2	He praises the Stotriyas with these (verses). The Gâyatrî, the Anushtubh and the Brhat are the Gâyatra.
2.7.3	The Gâyatrî is the right side of this (earth), the Anushtubb the left, and the Brhat the middle.
2.7.4	Food is placed in the middle of the body.
2.7.5	The Anushtubh is the middle of the Tristubh.
2.7.6	The verses of the Vaisvānara and the Arkasvatī are in the form of the Vaisvañara and the Arksvatī.
2.7.7	For Viśvāmitra saw it.
2.7.8	The verses of the Mahdvati and the Vridhvati are in the form.
2.7.9	Mahdvati and Vridhvati.
2.7.10	The Mahdvati is the Mahdvati, for this day is Mahdvati.
2.8.1	He recites the Gayatri verse "Indra is great, he is powerful" and attains the eighty verses with the Stoma verses "He has grown with the calf" in the Mahdvati form and the Vridhvati form.
2.8.2	It is of the Mahdvat and Vridhat kind.
2.8.3	It is of the Mahdvata kind, for this day is of the Mahdavat kind.
2.9.1	He recites the verse, "O Indra, thou art the giver of strength," and then recites the verse "O Indra, the giver of strength, thou art the protector of the sacrificer." The Mahdvati and Vridhatis are of the Mahdvati and Mahdvati kinds.
2.9.2	It is Mahdvati and Vrldhati.
2.9.3	It is Vrldhati, for this day belongs to the Vrldhati.
2.9.4	This is yours, O Indra, O Hari, with your gentle steeds. So says the hymn.
2.9.5	What he sings at the end, that is the ascent of the eighty Uṣṇīhi verses with the accomplished Brihatī verses.
2.10.1	Indra in the pressed Soma juices. Thus he attains the eighty Uṣnīhi verses. The great one knows the power of the giver, for he is great. With the verses of Vrīdha and Mahd.
2.10.2	The Gāyatrī verses are to be recited in the Mahāvrata and Mahāvrata-like rites.
2.10.3	This day is indeed great.
2.10.4	These eighty verses, when arranged, make up twenty-seven hundred verses.
2.10.5	There are twenty-seven hundred days and nights in a year. One thus attains the days and nights of a year by means of eighty (verses).
2.10.6	Some perform the Gāyatrī and Uṣṇīsa verses with the Sāman verses.
2.10.7	Some others take up four syllables again.
2.10.8	He takes up the Barhaspatya verses, the Kakubha verses and the Praga tha verses, each consisting of four syllables. These make up four hundred and four syllables. He places these in the Gayatri verses.
2.10.9	Thus the Gayatri verses are completed by the Ushnih verses.
2.10.10	One should not be angry.
2.10.11	Here it is accomplished.
2.10.12	"He sings the Sama to Indra."
2.10.13	"That which he praises at the end, with the accomplished Usnijas, is the ascent to the Vasha."
2.11.1	Then he praises the Vasha.
2.11.2	The Vasha is the belly.
2.11.3	With that accomplished, one should proceed to conquer the next.
2.11.4	Whatever is outside of that, he burns it from there, whatever is inside the belly.
2.11.5	Therefore many deities and many metres are mentioned as being under his control.
2.11.6	Therefore this much of food is stored in the belly in many forms.
2.11.7	Now these two verses are sung in the Vihṛta metre.
2.11.8	Now the Sūda-dohās.
2.11.9	It is released from there itself.
2.11.10	Here it is praised twenty-four times.
2.12.1	Now he sings these two verses in the Vipada metre.
2.12.2	The Pratiṣṭhānīya (hymn) is to be recited; the verses are of two feet; it is for stability.
2.13.1	Then he recites the Indra-Agni hymn, which is to be chanted in the Gāyatrī metre.
2.13.2	Indra and Agni are stability; it is for the sake of stability.
2.14.1	Then (he recites) the hymn of Avapana.
2.14.2	Avapana is stability; it is indeed for stability.
2.14.3	And these (verses) again become directed towards the east.
2.15.1	Then he recites the Anuṣṭubh verse.
2.15.2	This is the speech day, and the Anuṣṭup is speech. He thus establishes speech in speech.
2.15.3	"He goes to heaven, he goes to heaven." With this hymn he approaches the gods.
2.15.4	"He (Agni) who is wise, who is growing, who is old." This is a verse of the Arka. It is prosperous.
2.15.5	The Gāyatrī is the last verse. It is prosperous.
2.15.6	"He is great, he is great, he has great power."
2.15.7	This day is great.
2.16.1	Then he recites this hundred verses of Tristubh.
2.16.2	This is Indra's metre, namely Tristubh. He thus makes him prosper with his own metre.
2.16.3	The Hairaṇyasthūpīya, the Yātaūtiya, the Bṛhatratantara, and the Bṛhatrathantara are the two sets of verses recited before the two sets of Rathantara verses.
2.16.4	And the Adhvaryus offer the Soma to Indra, the lord of wealth. These are twenty-seven verses.
2.16.5	There are twenty-seven constellations.
2.16.6	He attains the constellation Viraj.
2.16.7	One should chant the hymn of Visvamitra.
2.16.8	For Visvamitra saw it.
2.16.9	One should recite the hymn of Vamadeva, for this is the left of the gods.
2.16.10	He should praise Vasishtha, for this is the Vasishtha of the gods.
2.16.11	There, before the Udbrahma hymn, he praises the following verses:
2.16.12	All desires are contained in this hymn.
2.16.13	Just as a herdsman, having let loose the cattle in the pasture, would spend the day in the pasture, so also, having taken all desires on both sides by means of these foot-steps, he takes them into himself.
2.16.14	And the last one is the Udumbari hymn with the Arka verse.
2.16.15	This is the form of this day.
2.16.16	He encloses three times with the formula.
2.16.17	Having enclosed, he recites the Ukthavīrya.
2.16.18	The first day is one day.
2.16.19	The day of consecration is the day of consecration.
2.16.20	The last day is the great vow.
2.16.21	It is great because it is great.
2.16.22	This day is great.
2.17.1	In the Sūda-dohās, which are performed once, when the number is counted in the Upasargantī, except for the silent chanting, it becomes a thousand Brihatī verses.
2.17.2-8	Now, of that thousand verses of the Brihatī metre, there are thirty-six thousand verses. There are as many days in a hundred years. One attains the days of a hundred years. The Anushtubh is complete. Some say that this is the day of speech. Speech is the Anushtubh. Speech is all beings.
2.17.9	Then indeed, this is all speech.
2.17.10	It is indeed established as the Brihatī-sāman.
2.17.11	This one who shines is indeed the Barhaspatya.
2.17.12	He makes it prosper with its own metre.
2.17.13	He calls three times.
2.17.14	These are indeed the three worlds.
2.17.15	He attains these worlds.
2.17.16	The Yajya is for one day.
2.17.17	One day is indeed prosperity. By prosperity.
2.17.18	They place the Prēṅkha-vessel on the ground without reciting the Vasat-call.
2.17.19	He descends towards the east with the vessel.
2.17.20	He removes the Prēṅkhas from the east.
2.17.21	Reciting the verse, "I have followed the one who has been born, I have followed him who is born," he touches the vessel.
2.17.22	The Atigrahya vessel of Visvakarman.
2.17.23	This is the Prajapati day.
2.17.24	Prajapati is the creator of all.
2.17.25	He thus makes him prosper in his own form.
2.17.26	This day Indra told to Angiras, Angiras to Dirghatamas.
2.17.27	Then Dirghatamas lived for ten human years.
2.17.28	The sage Dirghatamas, the son of Matamati, the son of Jujuru, has said this in the tenth age.
2.17.29	This is the right thing to say for one who desires long life, says Koushikan.
2.17.30	He who knows this and recites it on this day, attains the full span of life in this world.
2.17.31	He attains immortality and the unshakable world of heaven.
2.18.1-7	"We choose the Savitar of this (day)," is the first verse of the Visvadevas. "We choose," is the second verse of the Mahdvati. The Mahdvati is a great verse, for this day is great. "O god Savitar, today," is the Anucara. "We have found all good things," is the second Mahdvati. The Mahdvati is great, for this day also is great. This is the Savitri of the Mahdvata. "This is the great gift of the god Savitar."
2.18.8-14	This day is indeed great. "For they are the heaven and earth, the all-shining ones." This is the heaven and earth. "The great-spreading one, the mighty one, shines." This is great. This day is indeed great.
2.18.15	This is the water of the Visve Devas.
2.18.16	For water is the water of all the gods.
2.18.17	He places the oblation for the one-day sacrifice.
2.18.18	The one-day sacrifice is indeed a foundation, and it is through the foundation that he places it.
2.18.19	The one day sacrifice is indeed the one belonging to Vaisvānara,
2.18.20	The one- day sacrifice is indeed a Foundation, and it is by means of the Foundation that he places it,
2.18.21	"The Maruts are the sacrificers, the shining ones," this is the Marut offering.
2.18.22	"The great one shines in greatness."
2.18.23	It is great, for this day is great.
2.18.24	"Here is the light, it has been placed in the body, it has been shown." This is the Agni-Jatavedas hymn. "With the shining ones, with the shining ones." The last verse is with the word "ark."
2.18.25	"This is the form of this day." The Agni-Marut hymns.
2.18.26	These are the verses of this day.
2.18.27	This Agniṣṭoma comes to an end.
2.18.28	Agniṣṭoma is indeed Brahman.
2.18.29	This day is Brahman.
2.18.30	They indeed establish Brahman in Brahman.
2.18.31	Those who perform this day attain immortality. Those who perform this day.
3.1.1	Gangayani Chitra, while about to perform a sacrifice, chose Aruṇi.
3.1.2	He thought of his son Śvetaketu, saying, "Let him perform the sacrifice."
3.1.3	When he arrived, he asked, "O son of Gautama, is there a known world in which you will place me, or some other path in this world?"
3.1.4	He replied, "I do not know that. Let me ask the teacher."
3.1.5	He approached his father and asked him, "How should I reply?"
3.1.6	He said, "I also do not know this."
3.1.7	We study our own lessons like students and receive whatever others give us.
3.1.8	"Come, let us both go."
3.1.9	He approached Citra Gangayani with joined palms, saying, "I am coming."
3.1.10	He said to him, "O Gautama, you are worthy of Brahma, since you did not come with pride.
3.1.11	Come, I shall instruct you."
3.2.1	He said, "All those who depart from this world go to the moon.
3.2.2	The waning fortnight is nourished by their breath.
3.2.3	He generates them in the dark fortnight.
3.2.4	This is indeed the gate to the heavenly world, namely the moon.
3.2.5	He who answers him, he lets go.
3.2.6	But he who does not answer him, he rains here as rain.
3.2.7	Here he is reborn as an insect, a bird, a fish, a hawk, a lion, a boar, a dog, a tiger, or a man, in those places, according to his deeds and knowledge.
3.2.8	When he has come, he is asked, "Who are you?"
3.2.9	He should say to him, "The seasons have brought the seed from the fifteen-born, from the fatherly, and that you have deposited in the male, the agent, and the male, the father, has been deposited in the mother.
3.2.10	He is born, being born, the twelfth or thirteenth month.
3.2.11	The father, the twelve and the thirteen, I know that, I know that. The seasons, the immortal ones, have begun.
3.2.12	By that truth, by that austerity, I am the season, I am the seasonal one.
3.2.13	"Who are you?" "I am." He lets him go.
3.3.1	He comes to the path of the gods, and reaches the world of Agni.
3.3.2	He goes to the world of Vayu.
3.3.3	He goes to the world Varuna.
3.3.4	He goes the world of Indra.
3.3.5	He goes into the world of Prajapati.
3.3.6	He goes in the world of Brahma.
3.3.7	The lake Aroha, the staff-bearing Muhurta, the river Vijara, the tree Ilaya, the place of assembly Salaja, the unvanquished abode Aparajita, the door-keepers Indra and Prajapati, the measuring Vibhu, the couch of the discerning, the inexhaustible energy, the couch, the beloved mental one, the agreeable one, the one with eyes, having taken the flowers, he went to the Amba, the Ambayavi, the Apsaras, the Amba, and the rivers.
3.4.2	They adorn him with the ornaments of Brahma.
3.4.3	He, adorned with the ornaments of Brahmā, knowing Brahmā, approaches Brahmā.
3.4.4	He comes to the lake Āra.
3.4.5	He crosses it mentally.
3.4.6	Having crossed it, those who know the truth bathe there.
3.4.7	He comes in a moment to the place where the sticks are kept.
3.4.8	They flee from him.
3.4.9	He comes to the river Vijara.
3.4.10	He crosses it only in his mind.
3.4.11	There, good and bad deeds are washed away.
3.4.12	His dear relatives enjoy his good deeds, and his enemies enjoy his bad deeds.
3.4.13	Just as a person running with a chariot would look at the chariot wheel, so one should look at the day and night, and at all the pairs of opposites, good and bad.
3.4.14	He who is well-versed in the Veda, who knows the Veda, he indeed goes to the Brahman.
3.5.1	He comes to the Ilam tree.
3.5.2	The fragrance of Brahman enters him.
3.5.3	He comes into the Sâla-tree grove.
3.5.4	The taste of Brahman enters him
3.5.5	He comes to Aparajita, the abode.
3.5.6	The fame of Brahman enters him.
3.5.7	He comes, Indra-Prajapati, the doorkeepers.
3.5.8	They flee from him.
3.5.9	He comes, the all-pervading, the measured.
3.5.10	He enters the Brahma-tejas.
3.5.11	He comes to the discerning couch.
3.5.12	The two Sāman chants Brihat and Rathantara are the two earlier feet, and the two Śyaitanaudhasa are the two later feet.
3.5.13	The two Anūcya chants Vairūpa and Vaireja.
3.5.14	The two Tirāśī chants Śākvara and Raivata.
3.5.15-22	That wisdom is wisdom, for it sees with wisdom. He approaches the couch of immeasurable splendor. That is the breath. Its past and future feet are Śrī and Arā, and its two posterior feet are Śrīś and Arāś. In the Bhadra-yajña-yajīya (hymn), in the Śīrṣaṇya (hymn). In the Bṛhad-ratha-ntara (hymn), the Anūcya (hymn). The verses and chants are stretched out in the east, the Yajus formulas are stretched out in a diagonal direction. The Soma-drops are the covering.
3.5.23	The Udgītha is the support.
3.5.24	Sri is the ornament.
3.5.25	Brahma is in that.
3.5.26	He who knows it thus ascends to the top by the foot alone.
3.5.27	Brahma asks him, "Who are you?"
3.5.28	He should reply to him:
3.6.1	"I am the season."
3.6.2	"I am seasonal."
3.6.3	The semen, which is born from space, becomes the body of the year, which is the form of light, and the self of the being.
3.6.4	You are the self of the self of the beings.
3.6.5	You are what you are, I am that.
3.6.6	He says, "Who am I?"
3.6.7	One should say, "Truth."
3.6.8	What is that which is truth?
3.6.9	What is other than the gods and the vital airs, that is truth.
3.6.10	Now, what the gods and the vital airs are, that is truth.
3.6.11	That is expressed in one voice as truth.
3.6.12	This is all that there is.
3.6.13	He says to him, "This is all, I am."
3.6.14	This is expressed in a verse:
3.7.1	He is the belly of the Yajus, the head of the Sama, the body of the Rig, the imperishable one. He is to be known as the Rishi, the great one consisting of Brahman.
3.7.2	He says, "By what did you obtain the masculine names?"
3.7.3	One should say, "By the breath."
3.7.4	"By what did you get the neuter names?"
3.7.5	"By the mind."
3.7.6	"By which did you get the feminine names?"
3.7.7	"The voice."
3.7.8	"By whom did you get the smells?"
3.7.9	By the nose.
3.7.10	By what does one perceive forms?
3.7.11	By the eye.
3.7.12	By what sound?
3.7.13	By the ear.
3.7.14	By what food and taste?
3.7.15	By the tongue.
3.7.16	By what action?
3.7.17	By the hands.
3.7.18	By what happiness and suffering?
3.7.19	By the body.
3.7.20	By what joy, delight, and procreation?
3.7.21	By the genitals.
3.7.22-27	By what is it known? By the feet. By what is it known that the desires are to be known? One should say by wisdom alone. He says, "The water indeed is my world. This is yours." He who knows this, he conquers that victory of Brahman, he enjoys that prosperity. He who knows this, he conquers that victory, he enjoys that prosperit
4.1.1	Kauṣītaki said, "Prāṇa is Brahman."
4.1.2	The mind of this Brahman-Prāṇa is the messenger, the eye is the protector, the ear is the hearer, and the speech is the enveloper.
4.1.3	He who knows the mind as the messenger of this Brahman-Praṇa becomes a messenger.
4.1.4	He who sees the eye as the protector becomes a protector.
4.1.5	He who is the hearer, the listener, and the hearer of the hearer.
4.1.6	He who is the speech, the enveloper, and the enveloper of the enveloper.
4.1.7	To this Brahman, to this life, these deities bring oblations when he is asking for them.
4.1.8	Thus indeed, all beings bring oblations to him when he is asking, for him who knows thus.
4.1.9	He should not beg for his Upanayana.
4.1.10	Just as one who has begged in a village and not obtained anything sits down, saying, "I will not eat anything given from here," those who had refused him earlier would then advise him,
4.1.11	"This is the rule for one who does not beg."
4.1.12	Those who give food would then advise him: "We will give you."
4.2.1-6	Paiṅgya said, "Breath is Brahman." The eye and the ear are beyond that breath, which is Brahman. The ear is beyond that, and the mind is beyond that. The mind is beyond that, but the breath is beyond that. The breath is beyond that, and for that breath, which also is Brahman, these deities bring oblations to the one who is seeking.
4.2.7	Thus indeed, all beings, when asked, offer oblations to him who knows thus.
4.2.8	One should not beg for his Upanishad.
4.2.9	Just as one who has begged in a village and not obtained anything sits down, thinking, "I will not eat anything given from here," those who had refused him earlier approach him.
4.2.10	This is the dharma of one who does not beg.
4.2.11	Those who give food to him, they counsel him, saying, "We give to him."
4.3.1	Now, then, the exclusion of one-ness.
4.3.2	One who desires to acquire wealth should offer oblations of ghee at the full moon, new moon, or on any auspicious lunar day, having kindled the fire at one of these Parvan days, having surrounded it, having spread it, having sprinkled it, having touched the right knee, and having taken up the ladle.
4.3.3	Speech is the deity that obstructs. May it be released from that for me. To her, svāhā.
4.3.4	Breath is the deity that obscures. May it be liberated from that for me, to her, svāha.
4.3.5	Hearing is the deity that veils. May it be freed from that for me to her, svāh
4.3.6-7	The deity named Mind is the obstruction. May it release me from that. To her, svāhā. The deity named Wisdom is the obstruction. May it release me from it. To her, Svāhā.
4.3.8	Then, having smelled the smoke-scent, having anointed the limbs with ghee, having gone forth silently, one should speak the purpose or send a messenger.
4.3.9	One certainly obtains it.
4.4.1	Now, then, the divine Cupid.
4.4.2	He who is dear to him, he who desires to be dear to him, or to whomsoever of them he is dear, on one of their Parvan days, with the same covering, he offers these oblations of ghee.
4.4.3	I offer your speech to me, svāhā.
4.4.4	I offer up your breath to me, svāhà.
4.4.5	I offer you your sight to me, svähà.
4.4.6	I make an offering of your hearing to me, sväha.
4.4.7	I offer your mind to me, svāhā.
4.4.8	I offer your wisdom to me, svāhêti.
4.4.9	Then, having smelled the smoke, he should rub his limbs with ghee and proceed silently, desiring to touch.
4.4.10	He should stand in the wind or speak while standing.
4.4.11	He becomes dear.
4.4.12	They remember him.
4.5.1	Now, then, the restraining of the breath at dawn.
4.5.2	They call it the internal Agnihotra.
4.5.3	As long as a man speaks, he cannot breathe.
4.5.4	Then he offers the breath into speech.
4.5.5	As long a man breathes, he cannot speak.
4.5.6	Then he makes an offering of speech into the breath.
4.5.7	These are the endless, immortal oblations; he offers them constantly, whether awake or asleep.
4.5.8	And those other oblations which are limited, they are indeed made of action.
4.5.9	Now, those who knew this in ancient times did not offer Agnihotra.
4.6.1	Sukhabhrigara said, "It is the praise."
4.6.2	One should worship it as a Rig.
4.6.3	All beings worship him for supremacy.
4.6.4	One should meditate on that as the Yajur Veda.
4.6.5	All beings are yoked to him for supremacy. 
4.6.6	One should meditate that as the Sama Veda.
4.6.7	All being bow down to him for supremacy
4.6.8	One should meditate it as prosperity.
4.6.9	One should meditae on that as fame.
4.6.10	He should worship it as the brilliance.
4.6.11	Just as in the case of weapons, it is said to be the most glorious, most famous, and most brilliant, so also he becomes the most glorious, famous, and brilliant among all beings, he who knows this.
4.6.12	This is the ritualistic act of the Adhvaryu priest, who purifies himself, and in which he recites the Yajurveda.
4.6.13	The Hotṛ is made of Yajus and Ṛk.
4.6.14	The Udgātṛ is made of Ṛk and Sāman.
4.6.15	This indeed is the Self of the three Vedas.
4.6.16	He who knows this becomes the Self of Indra.
4.7.1	Now, here are the three forms of worship of Sarvajita Kausītaki.
4.7.2	All-conqueror, Kauṣītaki, having tied the sacrificial thread, having brought water, sprinkles it three times and the water vessel.
4.7.3	"You are the class, remove my sin."
4.7.4	Having covered it with this, he is in the middle.
4.7.5	"You have removed, remove my sin from here."
4.7.6	Having covered him with this, he goes to the setting sun.
4.7.7	"You are the covering, do you cover up my sin."
4.7.8	Whatever sin he commits during the day and night, that he covers up.
4.7.9	Similarly, one who knows this, standing near the sun covered by clouds,
4.7.10	whatever sin he commits during day and night, he covers it up.
4.8.1	Then, when the new moon has passed, and the moon is seen again, he should stand facing it with the same formula.
4.8.2	Or he should place it on green grass, with the verse, "My heart, O Susima, is in heaven and in the moon. I think it is there. May I know it. May I not grieve for my son."
4.8.3	For there is no one born before him, and he is not born before her.
4.8.4	Then having recited these three verses, "May you grow, may you be united, may your streams be united, may the forces be united. The Adityas are making the rays grow", he says, "May they not make us grow with our life, progeny and cattle. May they make grow the one who hates us and whom we hate, with his life, progeny and animals." Having recited the verse of Indra, he turns to the right, saying, "May I turn to the right of the sun's covering." He turns the right arm.
4.9.1	Then, on the full moon day, when the moon is visible, one should stand before it with this very (mantra).
4.9.2	"O King Soma, you are the discerning one, you are the five-faced Prajapati."
4.9.3	"Brahmana is one face, with that face you are the king. With that face, make me a food-eater."
4.9.4	The king, with one face, ate with that face. With that face, make me an eater of food.
4.9.5	The hawk, with one face ate with that face the birds. With that face make me an eater.
4.9.6	Fire, with one face consumed with that face this world. With that face
4.9.7	You have five faces. By that face you have conquered all beings. By that face make me an eater of food. Do not deprive us of life, offspring, and cattle.
4.9.8	"He who hates us and whom we hate, may he perish with his life, progeny and cattle." He turns the divine covering. He turns the covering of the sun. He turns the right arm.
4.10.1	Then, looking at her, he should touch her heart, saying, "Whatever is your heart, well-guarded, resting within Prajapati, by that may you be the mistress of immortality. May you not be afflicted by the sin of being a daughter."
4.10.2	For she does not have a previous offspring.
4.11.1-2	Then, when going away, he should smell the head of his son. "You have arisen from limb to limb, you are born from the heart. Your name is indeed the Self. Live for a hundred autumns." Thus he gives his name. "He becomes a stone, he becomes an axe, he becomes gold spread out. Your name is the brilliance. Live for a hun-dred autumns." Thus, he takes his name.
4.11.3	Then he embraces him with the formula, "With that wherewith Prajapati embraced the creatures, for non-injury, I embrace thee."
4.11.4	He mutters on his right ear, "O Indra, do thou bestow on us wealth, O bountiful one, O giver of wealth."
4.11.5	On the left ear, "Do thou bestow on us the best wealth."
4.11.6	Do not be afraid, do not be anxious. Live for a hundred autumns. Live, son, by your name. I smell your head." He should smell his head three times.
4.11.7	"I smell you with the sound of cows." He should smell him three times.
4.12.1	Now, then, the divine farewell.
4.12.2	This indeed is the Brahman that shines when the fire burns.
4.12.3	But when it does not burn, it dies.
4.12.4	Its light goes to the sun and its breath to the wind.
4.12.5	This indeed is the Brahman which shines when the sun is seen.
4.12.6	But when the sun is not seen, it dies. 
4.12.7	Its light goes into the moon and its breath to wind.
4.12.8	This indeed is the Brahman that shines, which is seen as the moon.
4.12.9	But this indeed dies when it is not seen.
4.12.10	Its light goes to the lightning, and its breath to the wind.
4.12.11	This indeed is the Brahman which shines, which is the lightning that flashes.
4.12.12	But this dies when it does not flash.
4.12.13	Its light then goes to the directions, and its breath goes to the wind.
4.12.14	All these deities enter into the wind, and when they die in the wind, they do not die.
4.12.15	From that very (wind) they again emerge.
4.12.16	Thus it is in the case of the gods.
4.12.17	Now, as regards the individual.
4.13.1	This indeed shines forth as Brahman, when it speaks through speech.
4.13.2	But when it does not speak, then it dies.
4.13.3	Of that, the eye alone is the brilliance.
4.13.4	The breath goes to the breath.
4.13.5	This indeed is the shining Brahman, which one sees with the eye.
4.13.6	But that which one does not see, that indeed dies.
4.13.7	Its light goes to the ear.
4.13.8	The vital airs go to the vital airs.
4.13.9	This indeed is the shining Brahma, which one hears with the ear.
4.13.10	But that one does not hear, that indeed dies
4.13.11	Its light goes into the mind.
4.13.12	The vital breaths go to the vital breaths.
4.13.13	This indeed is the Brahman that shines when one meditates with the mind.
4.13.14	But when one does not meditate, it dies.
4.13.15	Its radiance goes to the breath alone.
4.13.16	Breath goes to the breath.
4.13.17	All these deities enter the breath and do not die when the breath dies.
4.13.18	Therefore, they emerge again.
4.13.19	Now, if the two mountains, the southern and the northern, were to move towards him who knows thus, desiring to crush him, they would not be able to crush him.
4.13.20	And those who hate him and whom he himself hates, they alone perish around him.
4.14.1	Now, then, about the attainment of the highest good.
4.14.2-8	These very deities, disputing about what is best for them, departed from this body. It fell down dry, like a piece of wood, and was burnt. Then speech entered it. It spoke with speech, and was burnt as it was. Then the eye entered it. Then it saw with the eye, and was burnt, as it was. Then the ear entered it.
4.14.9	He spoke with speech, saw with sight, heard with hearing, and meditated with mind.
4.14.10	Then the mind entered him.
4.14.11	He spoke with speech, looked with sight, heard through hearing, meditated with mind, and meditated through mind.
4.14.12	Then Prana entered him.
4.14.13	Then he arose from that very place.
4.14.14	All the gods, knowing that the highest good is in the breath, having united themselves with the breath as the knower of the Self, and having emerged together with all these from this body,
4.14.15	they, established in the wind, having the Self in space, went to heaven.
4.14.16	Similarly, one who knows thus, having known the supreme good in the vital breath, having become the vital breath itself as the Self of Wisdom, he departs from this body along with all these.
4.14.17	He, established in the wind, having the space as the Self, goes to heaven.
4.14.18	He goes to that place where these gods are.
4.14.19	Having attained that, he becomes immortal, like the gods who are immortal, he who knows thus.
4.15.0	Now, then, the giving of the father to the son, which is called the giving of the son.
4.15.1	The father, about to send the son, calls him.
4.15.2	Having spread the house with fresh grass, having kindled the fire, having placed the water pot with the vessel, covered with a new garment, the father lies down.
4.15.3	The son comes and lies down on top, touching the senses with the senses.
4.15.4	Or he may give it to one who is seated facing him.
4.15.5	Then he gives it to him, saying:
4.15.6	"I entrust my speech to you." The father says this.
4.15.7	"I entrust your speech to me." The son says this.
4.15.8	“I entrust my life to you.” The father says this
4.15.9	“I entrust your life to me.” The son says this
4.15.10	“ I entrust my sight to you.” The Father says this
4.15.11	"Your eyes are in me," said the son.
4.15.12	"My ears are in you," said the father.
4.15.13	"Your ears are in me," replied the son.
4.15.14	"My tastes are in you," the father said.
4.15.15	"Your tastes are in me," the son replied.
4.15.16	"My actions are in you," declared the father.
4.15.17	"Your actions are in me," declared the son.
4.15.18	"May my happiness and sorrow be in you." Thus said the father.
4.15.19	"May your happiness and sorrow be with me." Thus said the son.
4.15.20	"May joy, delight, and progeny be in you." The father said.
4.15.21	"May my joy, delight, progeny be with you." The son said.
4.15.22	"Let there be affection in you." The Father said.
4.15.23	"Affection be with me." The son said.
4.15.24	"O father, I shall place my mind in you, so that you may know my desires."
4.15.25	"O son, I shall place your desires in me, so that you know my desires." "
4.15.26	"O father, I will place my mind in You."
4.15.27	"O Son, I will place your mind in me." "
4.15.28	"I will place my wisdom in you, O father."
4.15.29	"O father I will place your wisdom in me."
4.15.30	If he is to be a teacher, he should say this in brief.
4.15.31	"The father says, "I entrust my life to you."
4.15.32	The son says, "I place your life in me."
4.15.33	Then he exits, turning to the right.
4.15.34	The father blesses him, saying,
4.15.35	"May fame, spiritual radiance, and glory be yours."
4.15.36	Then the other one looks at the left shoulder.
4.15.37	Covering with the hand or with the end of the garment, he says, "May you attain the heavenly worlds and desires."
4.15.38	If he is not dead, the father may live in the son's wealth or go around it.
4.15.39	If he does die, they should conclude it as it should be concluded.
5.1.1	Pratardana, the son of Daivoda, attained Indra's beloved abode through battle and manly effort.
5.1.2	Indra said to him, "Pratardana, choose a boon."
5.1.3	Pratardana replied, "You yourself choose for me what you think is most beneficial for a human."
5.1.4	Indra said, "One does not choose a boon for oneself.
5.1.5	You yourself choose."
5.1.6	"Prārdana said, "You are indeed inferior to me."
5.1.7	"But Indra went away from the truth itself."
5.1.8	"For Indra is truth."
5.1.9	"He said to him, "Know me." He said, "I know you." He said to him, "Know me." "I know." He said again, "Know." He said,"I know."]
5.1.10	"He said, "Know yourself." He said "I know myself." He said "Know yourself." "Know yourself."
5.1.11	I killed the three-headed Tvashtra, and gave the ascetics with faces of animals to the jackals.
5.1.12	Having passed many boundaries in heaven, I killed the Prahladins; in the atmosphere, the Paulomains; on earth, the Kalakhanjas.
5.1.13	Not even a hair of me was harmed there.
5.1.14	He who knows me, for him there is no world of the dead. No one is affected by any action, neither by stealing, nor by killing an embryo, nor by killing one's mother, nor by killing his father.
5.1.15	No sin comes out of his mouth.
5.2.1	He said, "I am the life-force, the self-knowing one."
5.2.2	Worship me as the life-force and immortality.
5.2.3	Life is the life-force.
5.2.4	The breath is indeed life.
5.2.5	For as long as the breath is in this body, so long is life.
5.2.6	For by the breath one attains immortality in this world, and by wisdom one attains truth and resolve.
5.2.7	He who worships me as life and immortality, attains all life in this world.
5.2.8	He attains immortality and the unshakable world of heaven.
5.2.9	They say that the vital airs go to one place.
5.2.10	For no one can know by speech, by sight, by hearing, or by mind.
5.2.11	They say that the vital breaths, having become one, know all these things one by one.
5.2.12	When speech speaks, all the vital breaths follow.
5.2.13	The eyes see, and all the vital airs look on.
5.2.14	The ears hear, and all the vitals airs listen.
5.2.15	The mind thinks, and all the vitial airs think.
5.2.16	The vital air breathes, and all the other vital airs breathe.
5.2.17	Thus it is, said Indra.
5.2.18	There is indeed the highest good of the vital airs.
5.3.1	He who is deprived of speech lives.
5.3.2	We see the dumb.
5.3.3	One who is without eyes lives.
5.3.4	We see the blind.
5.3.5	One who has no ears lives.
5.3.6	We behold the deaf.
5.3.7	One who does not have the mind lives.
5.3.8	We perceive the children.
5.3.9	One who lacks arms lives.
5.3.10	One who loses his legs lives.
5.3.11	Thus we see.
5.3.12	Then indeed, the vital force itself, which is the Self of knowledge, having taken hold of this body, raises it up.
5.3.13	Therefore, one should worship this alone.
5.3.14	This is the attainment of everything in the vital force.
5.3.15	He who is the vital force, that is knowledge.
5.3.16	And what is knowledge, that is the vital force. 
5.3.17	This is his vision.
5.3.18	This is knowledge.
5.3.19	Where this person, sleeping, sees no dream at all, then in him the Prāṇa becomes one-fold.
5.3.20	Then speech comes to him with all names.
5.3.21	The eye comes to him with forms.
5.3.22	The ear comes to him with sounds.
5.3.23	The mind comes to him with meditations.
5.3.24	When he awakens,
5.3.25	Just as sparks fly from a burning fire in all directions, so do the vital airs from this Self, in accordance with their respective locations. From the vital airs come the gods, and from the gods the worlds.
5.3.26	This Self is indeed the Self of Knowledge, which, having encompassed this body, raises it up.
5.3.27	Therefore, one should worship this alone.
5.3.28	This is the attainment of all in the vital breath.
5.3.29	He who is the vital breath, that is wisdom.
5.3.30	She who is wisdom, that is the vital breath. This is its accomplishment.
5.3.31	This is knowledge.
5.3.32	When this man, being afflicted and about to die, comes to weakness and confusion, they say, "The mind has departed."
5.3.33	He does not hear.
5.3.34	He does not see.
5.3.35	He does no speak with speech.
5.3.36	He does
5.3.37	not meditate.
5.3.38	Then in him, Prāṇa alone becomes one-fold.
5.3.39	Then speech comes to him with all names.
5.3.40	The eye comes to him with the forms.
5.3.41	The ear comes to him with sounds.
5.3.42	The mind comes to him with meditations.
5.3.43	When he departs from this body, he departs with all of them.
5.4.1	All names are released in him through speech.
5.4.2	One obtains all names through speech.
5.4.3	All smells are released in him by means of the breath.
5.4.4	One obtains smells through the breath.
5.4.5	All forms are released in him with the eye.
5.4.6	One obtains forms through the eye.
5.4.7	All sounds are released in the ear.
5.4.8	One obtains all sounds through the ear.
5.4.9	All thoughts are released in the mind.
5.4.10	One obtains through the mind all thoughts.
5.4.11	For these two dwell together in this body and depart together.
5.4.12	Now we shall explain how all beings become one for that knowledge.
5.5.1	Speech alone is one of its limbs that has been raised up.
5.5.2	Its name is prescribed later on, the entire mass of beings.
5.5.3	Breath alone is one of his limbs that has been lifted up.
5.5.4	Its smell is prescribed later on as the entire mass of things.
5.5.5	The eye alone is one of her limbs that has been elevated.
5.5.6	Its form is beyond that, the mere elements that have been rejected.
5.5.7	The ear is the only limb of it that has been raised up.
5.5.8	Sound is beyond it, the mere elements rejected.
5.5.9	The tongue is the only limb that has been raised.
5.5.10	The taste of food is beyond it, rejected elements.
5.5.11	The hands are the only limbs that have been raised.
5.5.12	Their function is beyond it, discarded elements.
5.5.13	The body itself is the only limb of it which is raised up.
5.5.14	Its happiness and unhappiness are set aside beyond the body.
5.5.15	The genitals themselves are the only limb of them which is raised up,
5.5.16	Its joy, delight, and procreation are set aside beyond them.
5.5.17	The feet themselves are the only limbs of it which are raised up.
5.5.18	The gait is set aside beyond them.
5.5.19	The mind alone is its one limb that has been raised up.
5.5.20	Beyond that, his intellect and desires are well-established as mere elements.
5.6.1	Having ascended speech with wisdom, one attains all names through speech.
5.6.2	Having ascended the life force with wisdom, one obtains all smells through the life force.
5.6.3	Having ascended sight with wisdom, one gets all forms through sight.
5.6.4	Having ascended the ear with wisdom, he attains all sounds with the ear.
5.6.5	Having ascended the tongue with wisdom, he obtains all tastes with the tongue.
5.6.6	Having ascended both hands with wisdom, he performs all actions with the hands.
5.6.7	Having ascended his body with wisdom, he experiences happiness and suffering with the body.
5.6.8	Having mounted the seat with wisdom, one attains joy, delight, and progeny through the seat.
5.6.9	Having mounted the feet with wisdom, one obtains all the feet through the feet.
5.6.10	Having mounted mind with wisdom, one gains all the contemplated things through the mind.
5.7.1	For there is nothing that can be accomplished by speech other than wisdom.
5.7.2	He says, "My mind was elsewhere."
5.7.3	I did not know this name.'
5.7.4	For the breath, when it is known, does not make known any smell.
5.7.5	He says, 'My mind was elsewhere.'
5.7.6	'I did not know this smell.'
5.7.7	The eye, when it is cognized, does not make any form known.
5.7.8	He says 'My mind was somewhere else.'
5.7.9	I did not know this form."
5.7.10	For the ear, which is not a knower, cannot make any sound known.
5.7.11	He says, "My mind was elsewhere."
5.7.12	"I did not know this sound."
5.7.13	For the tongue, which is not the knower, cannot know any taste of food.
5.7.14	He says "My mind was somewhere else."
5.7.15	I did not know this taste of food."
5.7.16	For the hands, when they are made to know, do not make any action known.
5.7.17	"Our mind was elsewhere," they said.
5.7.18	"You did not know this action of the boat."
5.7.19	For the body, when it is made to know, does not make known any pleasure or pain.
5.7.20	"My mind was elsewhere," he said.
5.7.21	I did not know whether it was happiness or unhappiness.
5.7.22	For the wise man cannot experience pleasure, joy, or delight in his feet.
5.7.23	He says, 'My mind was elsewhere.'
5.7.24	I did not know whether this was pleasure or joy.
5.7.25	For the sage cannot experience pleasure, delight, or joy in his feet.
5.7.26	Elsewhere, the mind was not. Thus he says.
5.7.27	"You have understood this boat."
5.7.28	For a mind that is understood does not succeed in anything. One who is understood does not understand.
5.8.1	"One who seeks to know speech."
5.8.2	One should know the speaker.
5.8.3	"One seeks to know smell."
5.8.4	One should understand the sniffer.
5.8.5	"One seeking to know form."
5.8.6-14	Know the seer. "Not the sound is to be known." Know the hearer. "Not taste is to be known." Know the knower of taste. "Not action is to be known." Know the doer. " Not pleasure and pain are to be known." Know the expansion of pleasure and pain.
5.8.15	He who seeks to know neither pleasure, nor delight, nor procreation.
5.8.16	He who knows the knower of pleasure, delight, and procreation.
5.8.17	"He who seeks to know not that."
5.8.18	He who knows that.
5.8.19	"He seeks to know not the mind."
5.8.20	He who is the knower.
5.8.21	These ten are the only elements of the real, in the higher knowledge.
5.8.22	The ten elements of knowledge are in the higher reality.
5.8.23	If there were only the elements, there would be no consciousness.
5.8.24	Or if there were only consciousness, there would be only the elements.
5.8.25	For without the other, form would not be established.
5.8.26	They are not different.
5.8.27	Just as the spokes of a chariot are fixed in the nave,
5.8.28	and the nave is fixed in the spokes.
5.8.29	In the same way, these elements are fixed in consciousness, and consciousness is fixed in the elements.
5.8.30	The Prajnas are deposited in the Prāṇa.
5.8.31	This very Prāṇa is the Self, the knower, the infinite, the immortal, the deathless. It does not become greater by good deeds, nor smaller by bad deeds.
5.8.32	For this alone makes one do good deeds, by which one is led to the higher worlds.
5.8.33	This alone makes one do bad deeds, by which he is led to the lower worlds.
6.1.3	He approached Ajatashatru Kaashi and said, "I will teach you the Vedas."
6.1.4	Ajatashatru replied, "I will give you a thousand."
6.1.5	Janaka is called Janaka because people run towards him.
6.2.1	In the sun, the great; in the moon, food; in lightning, truth; in thunder, sound; in the wind, Indra; in space, the full; in fire, the one who is not harmed by poison; in water, brilliance.
6.2.2	Thus is the divine.
6.2.3	Then, in the body, the reflection is in the mirror, the second is in the shadow, the sound is in the echo, death is in the dream, Yama is in the body, Prajapati is in the right eye, speech is in the left eye, and truth is in the left.
6.3.1	Balaki said, "I worship that person who is in the sun."
6.3.2	Ajātaśatru said to him, "Do not debate with him."
6.3.3	"I worship him as the one who stands above all beings, wearing white garments and standing above all beings."
6.3.4	He who worships him in this way becomes the head of all beings.
6.4.1	Bālāki said, "I worship that person who is in the moon."
6.4.2	Ajātaśatru said, "Do not debate with me about this.
6.4.3	I worship him as the Self of food."
6.4.4	He who worships him thus becomes the Self of food.
6.5.1	Bālāki said, "I worship that person who is in the lightning."
6.5.2	Ajātaśatru said, "Do not debate with me about this.
6.5.3	I worship him as the Self of Truth."
6.5.4	He who worships him thus becomes the Self of Truth.
6.6.1	Bālāki said, "I worship that person who is in the thunder."
6.6.2	Ajātaśatru said to him, "Do not debate with me about this.
6.6.3	I worship him as the Self of sound."
6.6.4	He who worships him thus becomes the Self of sound.
6.7.1	Bālāki said, "I worship that person who is in the wind."
6.7.2	Ajātaśatru said, "Do not debate with me about this.
6.7.3	I worship him as Indra, the unconquered, the invincible army."
6.7.4	He who worships him thus becomes victorious, invincible, and the conqueror of others.
6.8.1	Balāki said, "I worship that person who is in the sky."
6.8.2	Ajātaśatru said, "Do not debate with me about this.
6.8.3	I worship this Brahman as complete and unchanging."
6.8.4	He who worships him thus, is filled with progeny, cattle, fame, spiritual splendour, heaven, and all life.
6.9.1	Balaki said, "I worship that person who is in the fire."
6.9.2	Ajatashatru said, "Do not debate with him.
6.9.3	I worship him as one who is able to withstand poison."
6.9.4	He who worships him thus, becomes immune from poison.
6.10.1	Balaki said, "I worship that person who is in the water."
6.10.2	Ajatashatru said, "Do not debate with me about this.
6.10.3	I worship him as the Self of brilliance."
6.10.4	He who worships him in this way becomes the Self of brilliance.
6.10.5	Thus is the divine aspect.
6.10.6	Now the human aspect.
6.11.1	Balaki said, "I worship that person who is seen in the mirror."
6.11.2	Ajatashatru said, "Do not debate with me about this.
6.11.3	I worship him as a suitable one."
6.11.4	He who worships him in this way, his offspring is born as suitable and not unsuitable.
6.12.1	Bālāki said, "I worship the man who is in the shadow."
6.12.2	Ajātaśatru said, "Do not debate with him.
6.12.3	I worship him as the second who is not departing."
6.12.4	He who worships him thus obtains the second.
6.12.5	He becomes one who has the second.
6.13.1	Balāki said, "I worship that person who is heard in an echo."
6.13.2	Ajātaśatru said, "Do not debate with him.
6.13.3	I worship him as Asura."
6.13.4	He who worships him in this way does not become confused before his time.
6.14.1	Bālāki said, "I worship that person who is in sound."
6.14.2	Ajātaśatru said, "Do not debate with him.
6.14.3	I worship him as Death."
6.14.4	He who worships him thus does not die before his time.
6.15.1	Balaki said, "I worship that by which a sleeping man moves in a dream."
6.15.2	Ajatashatru said, "Do not argue with him.
6.15.3	I worship him as Yama, the king."
6.15.4	He who worships him thus, is made by him the foremost of all.
6.16.1	Bālāki said, "I worship the person who is in this body."
6.16.2	Ajātaśatru said, "Do not debate with me about this.
6.16.3	I worship him as Prajapati."
6.16.4	He who worships him thus is born with offspring, cattle, fame, and radiance, and attains heaven and all life.
6.17.1	Balāki said, "I worship the person in the right eye."
6.17.2	Ajātaśatru said, "Do not debate with me about this.
6.17.3	I worship him as the self of speech, the self of fire, the self of light."
6.17.4	He who worships him thus becomes the self of all these.
6.18.1	Balāki said, "I worship the person who is in the left eye."
6.18.2	Ajātaśatru said, "Do not debate with me about this."
6.18.3	"The self is truth, the self is lightning, the self is brilliance."
6.18.4	He who worships in this way becomes the self of all these.
6.19.1	Then indeed Bālāki became silent.
6.19.2	Ajaṭasatru said to him, "Is this the extent of Bālāka?"
6.19.3	Bālāki said, "This is the extent."
6.19.4	Ajaṭa-satru said to him, "You have deceived me. I will tell you about Brahman.
6.19.5	He said, "He who is the creator of these men, he alone knows what is to be done."
6.19.6	Then Balaaki, with a bundle of sacred grass in his hand, came to him and said, "I am coming."
6.19.7	Ajatashatru said to him, "I think it is against the rules that a Kshatriya should approach a Brahmana.
6.19.8	Come, I will teach you."
6.19.9	He went forth, taking hold of his hand.
6.19.10	They came to a sleeping man.
6.19.11	Ajātaśatru addressed him, saying, "O Soma, king of the great white-robed ones!"
6.19.12	He was indeed a student.
6.19.13	He was indeed struck with a stick.
6.19.14	He rose up from there.
6.19.15	Ajātaśatru asked him, "Where did this man lie down, O Bālāka, where he was found, and whence he came?"
6.19.16	"The arteries of the man, O Hita, extend from the heart to the navel. They are as fine as a hair split into a thousand parts.
6.19.17	The white, black, yellow and red ones are located in the body of the one who is tawny.
6.19.18	When he sleeps and sees no dream, then it happens.
6.20.1	Then this Prāṇa becomes one-fold in him.
6.20.2	Then Speech comes to him with all names.
6.20.3	The eye comes to him with the forms.
6.20.4	The ear comes to him with sounds.
6.20.5	The mind goes with all the meditations.
6.20.6	When he awakens, as from a burning fire sparks go out in all directions, even so from this Self the Prāṇas go out to their respective places, from the Prāṇās the gods, from the gods the worlds.
6.20.7	This is the same as the Self, the Self of the form of knowledge, has entered this body from the hairs to the nails.
6.20.8	Just as a razor is placed in its sheath or a garment is placed in its box, in the same way, this Self of the form knowledge has entered this body, from the hairs to nails.
6.20.9	These beings partake of this Self as their own, just as the dependents partake of the merchant.
6.20.10	Just as the merchant partakes of his dependents, or the dependents partake of their merchant,
6.20.11	in the same way, this Self, which is the knower, partakes of these selves.
6.20.12	In the same way, these selves partake of this Self.
6.20.13	As long as Indra did not know this Self, the Asuras overpowered him.
6.20.14	When he knew it, then he killed the Asuras, conquered them, and attained supremacy over all the gods, sovereignty, and lordship.
6.20.15	In the same way, one who knows this destroys all evil and attains the supreme sovereignty and lordship over all beings.
6.20.16	He who knows this, he who knows this.
7.1.1	Om, I shall speak the truth.
7.1.2	I shall speak the truth
7.1.3	May that protect me, may that protect the speaker, may that protect me, and may that protect the one who speaks.
7.1.4	May radiance be in me, may greatness be in me.
7.1.5	Speech is established in my mind.
7.1.6	Mind is established in my speech.
7.1.7	May I be revealed, revealed in me.
7.1.8	May the Veda be my guide.
7.1.9	May you not harm me.
7.1.10	I spend the day and night with this knowledge.
7.1.11	O Agni, Ida is homage, Ida is homage.
7.1.12	Salutations to the sages, the creators of mantras, the lords of mantras, to the gods.
7.1.13	May Sarasvati be gracious to us, may she be kind. May we not be deprived of her sight.
7.1.14	The mind is unassailable, the eye is pure, the sun is the best of lights.
7.1.15	Do not harm me in the consecration.
7.2.1	Now, indeed, the Upanishad of the Samhita.
7.2.2	The earth is the eastern form, the sky is the northern form, the wind is the Samhita. This is said by Shuravarir Mandukkeya.
7.2.3	Ākāśa is the same as Saṃhita. This was known by Māṇḍavya. He thought, "It has been taken away from me. It is not equal to my son."
7.2.4	"It has been taken from me" was known by Āgastya.
7.2.5	Because the wind and space are the same as the father and son.
7.2.6	This is the Adhidevata.
7.2.7	Now the Adhyātma.
7.2.8	The mouth is the former form, the mind is the latter form, and the breath is the union, says Mandukkeya, the son of Shourava.
7.2.9	Then his son said, "The mind first praises, then the voice speaks."
7.2.10	Therefore the mind is the former form and the voice is the latter form. The mind and the voice are the union.
7.2.11	This horse-chariot, yoked with the Prishti-horses, united with mind, speech and breath, carries one to the heavenly world.
7.2.12	He who knows this union, is united with offspring, cattle, fame, brahminical lustre, and the heavenly world. He attains the whole of life. Thus it is said in the Mandukya Upanishad.
7.3.1	Now, the Shakalya Upanishad.
7.3.2	Earth is the former form, Heaven is the latter form, Wind is the union, Rain is the junction, the Controller is the binder.
7.3.3	And indeed, when the powerful cloud rains down rain, it is there.
7.3.4	The heaven and earth are the binders. This is the (relation) with the gods.
7.3.5	Now the (relation) to the self.
7.3.6	This man is the entire egg.
7.3.7	It has two openings.
7.3.8	Herein, this is the former form, this is the later form.
7.3.9	Herein, this is space in between.
7.3.10	Just as space is between heaven and earth, so the breath is dependent on this space, just as the wind is dependent on that space.
7.3.11	Just as these three luminaries are in the sky, so these three luminaries in the man.
7.3.12	Just as that divine sun, so this eye on the head.
7.3.13	Just as that lightning in the sky, so this heart in the self.
7.3.14	Just as this fire on the earth, so this semen in the anus.
7.3.15	Thus having determined the self everywhere, he says: This is the former form, this is the later form, the mind, speech, and the breath are indeed united.
7.3.16	This horse-chariot, yoked to the Prishti-horses, united with mind, speech and breath, carries one to the heavenly world.
7.3.17	He who knows this union, is united with offspring, cattle, fame, radiance, heaven and the world. He attains the whole of life.
7.4.1	Earth is the former form, Heaven is the latter form, Wind is the union, the directions are the junction, the Sun is the union-junction. This is the view of Vaishvamitra.
7.4.2	Thus is the Adhidevata (the Supreme Being).
7.4.3	Now the Adhyatma (the Supreme Self).
7.4.4	Speech is the former form; Mind is the latter form; Breath is the union; Ear is the junction; Eye is the union-juncture.
7.4.5	He who knows this Samhita is united with progeny, cattle, fame, spiritual glory, heaven, and the world. He attains the full span of life.
7.5.1	Agni is the eastern form, the moon is the northern form, and lightning is the Samhita, says Suryadatta.
7.5.2	Thus is the Adhidevata (supernatural) aspect.
7.5.3	Now the Adhyatma (supernatural) aspects: Speech is the eastern form; mind is the northern form; truth is the Samhita.
7.5.4	He who knows this Samhita thus, is united with progeny, cattle, fame, spiritual splendour, heaven, and the world. He attains the full span of life.
7.6.1	The earth is the former form, the sky is the latter form, and time is the Samhita, says Radheya.
7.6.2	Thus is the Adhidevata.
7.6.3	Now the Adhyatma: Speech is the former form; mind is the latter form; the Self is the Samhita.
7.6.4	He who knows this Saṃhitā thus, is united with progeny, cattle, fame, brahminical splendour, heaven, and world. He attains the entire span of life.
7.7.1	Speech is the former form, mind is the latter form, and knowledge is the Saṃhitā, says Pauṣkarasādi.
7.7.2	He who knows this Samhita is united with offspring, cattle, fame, spiritual splendour, heaven, and the world. He attains the full span of life.
7.8.1	Now, then, the Anuvyahaaras.
7.8.2	One should know that the breath is the family.
7.8.3	If someone were to say that the breath is a family, and if anyone were to think that he could unite the breath with the family,
7.8.4-6	"You are not able to unite the life-breath with the family." He should say, "The life-breath will unite you with the family." If he thinks he is unable, he should say, "You tried to unite the life breath with the family, but you were not able to unite it. The life-breath will indeed unite you with the fami
7.8.7	As one would say, whether one is speaking or not speaking, it would be the same.
7.8.8	But one should not say anything other than what is good. One should say, "May there be prosperity to the Brahmins." This is the view of Mandukkeya, the son of Shuravira.
7.9.1	If he should accuse a person who is speaking of the lineage, saying, "If you think that he is capable, then I say that the lineage is capable of harming the life-force," then he should say, "You are not capable of harming the lineage."
7.9.2	He should say to him, "The lineage will harm your life-force."
7.9.3	If he thinks that the Prāṇa is unable to do so, then he should say, "The Prāṇa will make you a bamboo."
7.9.4	He should say, "Prāṇa will make a bamboo of you."
7.9.5	Just as one would say to someone who is speaking or not speaking, "You will be close to me," so it would be.
7.9.6	But he should not say anything other than what is good. He should say, "May there be salutations to the Brahmins." This is the view of Shuravira Mandukeya.
7.10.1	Now, the teachings of Nirbhuja.
7.10.2	The abode of the earth is the Nirbhuja, the abode of the day is the Pratiṇa, the abode of space is both between them.
7.10.3	He who speaks of the Nirbhuj as the highest,
7.10.4	he should be told: "The deity of the earth is your deity. The earth will protect you as your deity."
7.10.5	If one accuses another of a crime committed, one should say to him, "The god Heaven will punish you."
7.10.6	If one accuses another of crimes committed between the two, one should say, "The god Atmosphere will punish you." The crime committed is the crime of the god Atmosphere.
7.10.7	What one does in the middle is the form of the Nirbhuj.
7.10.8	Now, when he recites the pure syllable, it is at the tip of the grass.
7.10.9	Both are covered in between.
7.10.10	One desiring food should recite the grass, one desiring heaven should recite the tip, one desiring both should recite both in between.
7.10.11	If someone accuses him of being a thief, he should say, "The accused is not guilty of theft, he is not guilty of the two lower offences."
7.10.12	If someone accuses him of having stolen something that has been stolen, he should say "The accused is innocent of the theft, he is innocent of the two higher offences."
7.10.13	He who accuses him of both is not guilty.
7.11.2	The former syllable is the former form, the latter syllable is the latter form.
7.11.3	That is the Samhita with the Y and V in between.
7.11.4	He who knows this Samhita thus, is united with offspring, cattle, fame, radiance, heaven, and world. He attains the full span of life.
7.12.1	And we say, "We are the ones with arms and faces," said Hvastrot Mandukayin.
7.12.2	The former syllable is the former form, the latter syllable is the latter form.
7.12.3	That which is the measure between the former and the latter forms, by which it divides the union, by which it distinguishes the measure from the measure, by which it indicates the tone from the tone, that is called the union.
7.12.4	He who knows this union thus, is united with offspring, cattle, fame, radiance, heaven, and world, and attains the full span of life.
7.13.1	Then his son, the middle one, Prātyodhi, the son of Magadha, said: "The former is the former form, and the latter is the latter form."
7.13.2	That which is the measure that indicates the junction, that is the Sama. It is said: "One who knows the Sama knows the Samhita."
7.13.3	This is stated in a Vedic verse: "May those who harm us not succeed. May the enemies who are devoid of food and are in the wrong place not succeed."
7.13.4	"O Brihaspati, you know the path of the gods. No one else knows the path of the Veda."
7.13.5	Thus it is said.
7.13.6	He who knows this Samhita is united with progeny, cattle, fame, spiritual splendour, heaven and the world. He attains the full span of life.
7.14.1	Vak is united with Pranas, says Kauntaravya.
7.14.2	Pranas are united with Pavamana, Pavamana with all the gods, all the gods with heaven and the world, heaven and the lower world with Brahma. This is the lower and higher Samhita.
7.14.3	He who knows this lower and higher Samhita, he is united with progeny, cattle, fame, radiance, heaven and world, just as this lower and higher samhita.
7.14.4	If he is attacked by the other side or if he speaks for his own cause, he should know that he is speaking. The learned one has come to heaven through the recitation of the Veda for the purpose of speaking to the gods. It will be like this.
7.14.5	By this lower and higher (recitation), it will indeed be so.
7.15.1	Bhārgava says: The mother is the former form, the father is the latter form, and the offspring is the recitation.
7.15.2	This is all said in one form.
7.15.3	Mother and father, and all progeny.
7.15.4	This is the collection of Aditi.
7.15.5	Aditi is indeed all this, whatever is here, whatever is in the world.
7.15.6	This is stated in a verse: Aditi is heaven, Aditi is space, Aditi is the mother, she is the father, she is the son.
7.15.7	The All-gods, Aditi, the five classes of people, Aditi is the birth, Aditi is generation.
7.15.8	He who knows this collection thus, is united with offspring, cattle, fame, and radiance, and attains the heavenly world and all life.
7.16.1	The wife is the former form, the husband is the latter form, the son is the collection, the semen is the union, the procreation is the union, says the elder Shakalya.
7.17.4	He who knows this Samhita is united with progeny, cattle, fame, radiance, heaven, and the world. He attains the full span of life.
7.18.1	"Vācā vācā vācām iti Pañcāla-Candaḥ (says).
7.18.2	"The Vedas are united by speech, the metres by speech, and friends are united by speech.
7.18.3	"When one is reciting or speaking, then the breath becomes speech.
7.18.4	Speech then finds support in the vital breath.
7.18.5	And when he sleeps or is silent, then speech becomes the vital breath. The vital breath then finds support in speech. They find support in each other.
7.18.6	This is stated in a verse: "The single Suparna entered the ocean. He surveys this entire universe."
7.18.7	I saw him in the cooking pot, with his mind, and he found his mother, and she found him.
7.18.8	Thus it is said.
7.18.9	Speech is the mother, and the breath is the calf.
7.18.10	He who knows this collection thus, is united with offspring, cattle, fame, radiance, heaven, and world. He attains the whole of life.
7.19.1	The collection is united in the form of Brihat and Rathantara. Thus says Tarksya.
7.19.2	Speech is the form of Rathantara, and breath is of Brihat.
7.19.3	Indeed, the Samhita is joined by both, by speech and by breath.
7.19.4	In this Upanisad, Tarksya said, "One should protect the cows for a year."
7.19.5	He who knows this Samhita thus, is joined with offspring, cattle, fame, radiance, heaven, and world. He attains the whole of life.
7.20.1	The former form is the motion, the latter form is the cessation, and the combination is the stability, so says Jaratkaravārttabhāga.
7.20.2	In this collection, the moments of destruction, the instants, the hours, the days and nights, the half-months, the months, the seasons, and the years are combined.
7.20.3	This collection combines these times.
7.20.4	Time brings together the states of motion, cessation, and stability.
7.20.5	All this is brought together by motion, cessation, stability.
7.20.6	Thus is the Adhidevata.
7.20.7	Now the Adhyatma. The past form is the past, the future form is the future, and the present form is the present. Thus, time is brought together.
7.20.8	This is stated in the verse: "That great secret name by which the past is known, and by which the future will be known,
7.20.9	The ancient, born, light, which is his beloved, the beloved ones have entered the five.
7.20.10	Thus it is said.
7.20.11	He who knows this Samhita is united with offspring, cattle, fame, brahminical splendor, heaven, and world. He attains the entire span of life.
7.21.1	Now, then, the words of Valishikhayanin.
7.21.2	Valishikhayanin said: "These five are the great elements."
7.21.3	Earth, wind, space, water, light, these are united with each other.
7.21.4	And those other small things that are united with the great elements, this is the union of all things.
7.21.5	He who knows this union, is united with offspring, cattle, fame, radiance, heaven, and world. He attains the whole of life.
7.22.1	All speech is Brahman, thus indeed did Lauhīka say.
7.22.2	Those who know that all words are speech,
7.22.3	The sage said this: "I wander with Rudras and Vasus."
7.22.4	This speech becomes all sounds.
7.22.5	He who knows this Samhita is united with progeny, cattle, fame, spiritual glory, heaven, and world. He attains the full span of life.
7.22.6	Just as this Brahman becomes of the form of desire and of the nature of desire, so also he becomes of the form and nature of desire in all beings.
7.22.7	He who knows this, he who knows this.
8.1.1	The senior Shakalya said, "The breath is the lineage."
8.1.2	Just as all the other bamboos are collected in the bamboo-stalk, so in this Prāṇa all the Ātmans are collected.
8.1.3	This Ātman has Prāṇa as its form of heat, bones as its form of touch, marrow as its form of sound, flesh and blood as its form of colour, and the fourth form is the form of the syllable 'A'.
8.1.4	This is not said to be the three, says Mandukkeya.
8.1.5	Of these three, there are sixty-three joints, and of those there are twenty-seven hundred.
8.1.6	There are twenty-seven hundreds of days and nights in a year.
8.1.7	One attains the days and nights of a year.
8.1.8	This year-long honour is made of sight, hearing, metre, mind and speech. It is the Self.
8.1.9	He who knows this year-long honour made of sight, made of hearing, made of metre, made of mind, made of speech, and made of the Self, attains union with the year, attains the same world, the same form, the same share.
8.1.10	The son of Pūtrī, Pāśuman, has attained the full span of life. The divine Yauvanāśva made it.
8.2.1	Now the Kauṣṭharavyas.
8.2.2	There are three hundred and sixty thousand letters.
8.2.3	There are also three hundred and sixty thousands of Uṣṇas.
8.2.4	There is also three hundred and sixteen thousand of Sandhis.
8.2.5	The letters that we have mentioned are the days.
8.2.6	The Uṣṇas are the nights.
8.2.7	The junctions of the day and night that we have mentioned are the junctions.
8.2.8	Thus is the Adhi-Deva.
8.2.9	Now the Adhyatma. The bones that we have mentioned in the Adhi-deva are the bones in the Adhyat-ma.
8.2.10	The marrow that we have mentioned as the heat in the Adhi Deva is the marrow in the Adhyātma.
8.2.11	This indeed is the present Prāṇa, namely, marrow. This is the semen. There is no success of semen without Prāṇa.
8.2.12	If semen were to be emitted without Prāṇa, it would be destroyed and would not be successful.
8.2.13	The joints which we have described in relation to the gods, they are the joints in the body.
8.2.14	The bones of this body, including the marrow, are forty-five hundred.
8.2.15	The joints are fifty-eight thousand.
8.2.16	The Bṛhatī verses of the Ārkaliṇī are composed in eighty thousand verses.
8.2.17	This is the honour of the day, consisting of the eye, ear, metre, mind and speech.
8.2.18	He who knows this honour of the day consisting of the eye ear, metre, the mind and speech, attains union with the day, the world, the form and the share.
8.2.19	The son of a man who has cattle becomes one who has cattle, and lives the whole of his life.
8.3.1	There are four kinds of men, says Vatsa: the physical man, the man of the Vedas, the man of Vedic lore, and the Great Man.
8.3.2	The physical man is the one whom I have mentioned, and he is the divine Self. The one who is the bodyless, the Self of knowledge, is the essence of that.
8.3.3	The man of the Vedas is the one whom we have mentioned, and it is the recitation of the syllables.
8.3.4	This is the form of that. This is the taste of that.
8.3.5	The person of the Vedas, whom we have mentioned, by whom the gods, the Rg Veda, the Yajur Veda, and the Sama Veda are known, this is the Brahman, the taste of that is Brahman.
8.3.6	Therefore one should appoint as the officiating priest the most learned in Brahman, who knows the essence of the sacrifice.
8.3.7	The great man, as we have called him, is the sun, and the year is his essence.
8.3.8	He who is the bodyless Self and he who is the sun, know that they are one.
8.3.9	This is stated in a verse:
8.4.1	The wonderful array of the gods has risen, the eye of Mitra, Varuna and Agni.
8.4.2	The sky, the earth, the atmosphere, the sun, the soul of the world, and the standing world.
8.4.3	Thus it is said.
8.4.4	Now Vatsa said, "This very knowledge, this very collection of verses, is being composed." Now the Bahvrcas (many-versed) recite this in the Mahāuktha (great praise), the Adhvaryus in Agni, the Chandogas in the Mahāvrata (great vow), this in the earth, this in the sky, this in heaven, this in Agni, this in Vayu, this in the moon, this in the stars, this in the waters, this in the plants, this in all beings, this in the imperishable, this is Brahman."
8.4.5	This is stated in a Vedic verse:
8.5.1	We have risen above the darkness, seeing the light,
8.5.2	The supreme light, the divine Sun, we have reached, the supreme light.
8.5.3	Thus it is said.
8.5.4	This Self is the embodiment of the imperishable, the embodiment of the eye, the embodiment of hearing, the embodiment of Chanda, the embodiment of mind, the embodiment of speech.
8.5.5	He who thus praises the Self, which is made of the eye, ear, mind, and speech, to another, his Vedas become like milk-yielding cows.
8.5.6	He becomes a part of speech and a part of what is not spoken.
8.5.7	This is stated in the following verse:
8.6.1	He who abandons his friend, the knower of truth, does not even have a share in his speech.
8.6.2	He who hears him, hears the truth, does not know the path of good deeds.
8.6.3	Thus it is said.
8.6.4	There is no share in his speech for one who does not speak. Therefore, one should not recite this on another day.
8.6.5	He should not offer fire, nor praise with the Mahāvrata hymn, lest he should injure himself.
8.6.6	He who is the bodyless one, the one who knows, and he who is the sun, we have said that they are one. When they are seen separately,
8.7.1	the sun is seen like the moon, but the rays do not appear.
8.7.2	The sky becomes reddish like madder.
8.7.3-7	The anus is separated. One should know that the soul of one who has had sexual intercourse will live for a short time. One should do whatever one thinks should be done. Or if one sees oneself in a mirror or in water, with a crooked head or without a head, one should know that it is the same.
8.7.8	If there is a shadow with a hole, or not, one should know it is the same.
8.7.9	If the sun appears like a hole, or like a chariot hub, one should know that is the same. 
8.7.10	If fire appears like a blue (light), or one sees a peacock's neck in a great cloud, or lightning flashes,
8.7.11	or lightning in the sky without clouds.
8.7.12	If he sees her through a cloud, he should know it in the same way.
8.7.13	If he sees her by closing his eyes and looking at her, he should know that it is like seeing a mirage.
8.7.14	If he hears her by closing his ears and listening to her,
8.7.15	When one hears the sound of the fire burning like the sound of a chariot, then one should know that it is like this.
8.7.16	Even if the girl is seen to be confused, or if the two shadows are seen or not seen, one should know that this is also like this.
8.7.17	He who is not heard, not thought of, not known, not seen, not spoken, not proclaimed, who hears, thinks, knows, sees, speaks, proclaims, and who is the inner person of all beings, that is my Self.
8.7.18	He, while departing, attains this bodyless Self, which is the knower, and abandons the other, the material one.
8.7.15	When one hears the sound of the fire burning like the sound of a chariot, then one should know that it is like this.
8.7.16	Even if the girl is seen to be confused, or if the two shadows are seen or not seen, one should know that this is also like this.
8.7.17	He who is not heard, not thought of, not known, not seen, not spoken, not proclaimed, who hears, thinks, knows, sees, speaks, proclaims, and who is the inner person of all beings, that is my Self.
8.7.18	He, while departing, attains this bodyless Self, which is the knower, and abandons the other, the material one.
8.8.4	The form of Rathantara is touch, the Uṣṇīṣa of Vāmadevya is sound, and the Svaras are of Bṛhat.
8.8.5	The form of Prāṇa is touch, the Usnīṣa of Apāna is sound, and Svaras are of Manas.
8.8.6	The form is of Prāṇa, the Uṣnīṣa is of Apāna, and the Svarās are of Udāna. Svaras again is given.
8.8.7	He who knows this indeed knows all speech.
8.9.1	Then this divine lute becomes the human one, which is its imitation.
8.9.2	Just as this one has strings and a drum, so does that one have strings and a drum.
8.9.3	Just as the head of this one, so is the head of that one.
8.9.4	Just as its bamboo, so is the staff of that one.
8.9.5	Just as this one has a belly, so does that one have a belly.
8.9.6	Just as this one has eyes and a nose, so does that other one have eyes and a nose.
8.9.7	Just as the fingers of this one are restrained and covered, so are the joints of that one.
8.9.8	Just as these fingers are of this one, so are the strings of that one.
8.9.1	Then this divine lute becomes the human one, which is its imitation.
8.9.2	Just as this one has strings and a drum, so does that one have strings and a drum.
8.9.3	Just as the head of this one, so is the head of that one.
8.9.4	Just as its bamboo, so is the staff of that one.
8.9.14	He who knows this divine lute, becomes the most learned and most famous. His words are listened to by the assembly. "What he desires, that he gets. Where the noble speech speaks, there he is known."
8.10.1	Now, the words of Tándavínda.
8.9.5	Just as this one has a belly, so does that one have a belly.
8.9.6	Just as this one has eyes and a nose, so does that other one have eyes and a nose.
8.9.7	Just as the fingers of this one are restrained and covered, so are the joints of that one.
8.9.8	Just as these fingers are of this one, so are the strings of that one.
8.10.2	Just as a poorly played lute does not produce the full sound of the lute, so too, a poorly spoken speech does not produce the complete meaning of the speech.
8.9.9	Just as this one has a mouth, so does that one.
8.9.10	Just as this one has notes, so does that.
8.9.11	Just as she is covered with a skin with hair, so is that one.
8.9.12	In ancient times they used to cover the lute with a skin with hairs.
8.9.13	This is the divine lute.
8.10.3	Just as this lute, when played by a skillful player, accomplishes the entire purpose of the lute, in the same way, when speech is initiated by a skillful speaker, it accomplishes the entire meaning of speech.
8.10.4	The son of Kātyāyanīputra, Jātaukarṇya, said: "The brilliance of this lute is the collection of verses."
8.9.14	He who knows this divine lute, becomes the most learned and most famous. His words are listened to by the assembly. "What he desires, that he gets. Where the noble speech speaks, there he is known."
8.10.1	Now, the words of Tándavínda.
8.10.2	Just as a poorly played lute does not produce the full sound of the lute, so too, a poorly spoken speech does not produce the complete meaning of the speech.
8.10.5	Then indeed he recites the entire Brahmana.
8.11.1	Prajapati, having created beings, became exhausted. He composed himself with the metres.
8.11.2	Because he composed himself with the Metres, therefore it is called Samhita.
8.11.3	Of that Samhita, the letter Na is strength, the letter Sa is the vital breath, the Self is the Samhita.
8.10.3	Just as this lute, when played by a skillful player, accomplishes the entire purpose of the lute, in the same way, when speech is initiated by a skillful speaker, it accomplishes the entire meaning of speech.
8.10.4	The son of Kātyāyanīputra, Jātaukarṇya, said: "The brilliance of this lute is the collection of verses."
8.11.4	Now this is the minor variant: the nails, the hair, and the signs.
8.11.5	He who doubts here should say only the letter Sa, excluding the letter Na. He should say only the Sa letter.
8.11.6	Similarly, he who doubts here should only say the letter Sha, excluding the Sha letter. He should say the Sha letter.
8.10.5	Then indeed he recites the entire Brahmana.
8.11.1	Prajapati, having created beings, became exhausted. He composed himself with the metres.
8.11.2	Because he composed himself with the Metres, therefore it is called Samhita.
8.11.3	Of that Samhita, the letter Na is strength, the letter Sa is the vital breath, the Self is the Samhita.
8.11.7	The two letters Na and Sa, indeed, are the two Vedas. One who knows this should study the verses in a connected manner. One should know that it is for longevity. One should know it in this way only.
8.11.8	And the history and the Puranas are the speech. Whatever else one may study after making it Brahmanic, one should know that also in this way only.
8.11.9	Now, when we study the verses in connection with the text and also expound the Mandukayiya chapter, then we have attained the N and S sounds. Thus said the short Mandukayiya.
8.11.10	Now, as to why we study the verses in a connected form and also study them by heart, the elder Śākalya has said that the letters Na and Ṣa have come to us.
8.11.7	The two letters Na and Sa, indeed, are the two Vedas. One who knows this should study the verses in a connected manner. One should know that it is for longevity. One should know it in this way only.
8.11.8	And the history and the Puranas are the speech. Whatever else one may study after making it Brahmanic, one should know that also in this way only.
8.11.11	Now, those who knew this, the Kâvâsyas, said: "For what purpose shall we sacrifice? For what purpose shall we pray? For we offer the breath in speech, and speech in breath, for he who is the source of all is also the sink of all."
8.11.9	Now, when we study the verses in connection with the text and also expound the Mandukayiya chapter, then we have attained the N and S sounds. Thus said the short Mandukayiya.
8.11.10	Now, as to why we study the verses in a connected form and also study them by heart, the elder Śākalya has said that the letters Na and Ṣa have come to us.
8.11.11	Now, those who knew this, the Kâvâsyas, said: "For what purpose shall we sacrifice? For what purpose shall we pray? For we offer the breath in speech, and speech in breath, for he who is the source of all is also the sink of all."
9.1.7	We meditate on the divine Bhṛgu.
9.1.8	May he inspire our minds.
9.1.9	The unassailable mind and the clear eye,
9.1.10	The sun is the best of lights, may you not harm me in the consecration.
9.2.1	He who knows the eldest and the best, becomes the eldest and the most esteemed among his own people.

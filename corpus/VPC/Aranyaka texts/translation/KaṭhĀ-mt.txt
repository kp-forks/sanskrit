2.5.94	One turns away animals from Rudra.
2.5.102	He says, "Go to heaven, go to the sky, go to the earth, go to the five directions." Thus he satisfies these worlds and the directions with the hot offering.
2.5.103	"Go to the gods who drink hot offerings."
2.5.104	He thus satisfies those gods who drink hot offering with the hot offering in this way.
2.5.105	He offers with the formula, "To you, Obeisance to the gods who offer hot offerings," with the Upāmantrana formula to the great hero.
2.5.95	All the deities now hope for him, "He will offer to me, he will offer to me."
2.5.96	The deities are indeed looking at him.
2.5.97	They are the ones who are not sharing, and they are the ones who can harm.
2.5.98	When he says, "To Agni, to you, the possessor of wealth, svāhā," he makes the deities sharers, for the sake of not harming himself.
2.5.106-112	Those very gods who drink the Gharma, he thereby satisfies them in the Gharma. The gods and the Asuras performed the Pravargya together. Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did. The Asuras performed the silent Pravargya. He burned them up. The gods performed the loud Pravargya. They became the gods.
2.5.99	Some of the gods are the recipients of the Yajus, others are the recipients of oblations.
2.5.100	He pleases both of them.
2.5.101	"In heaven, O Dhi, this sacrifice, this sacrifice in heaven." The worlds and the directions desired to be in the hot-water bath.
2.5.113	Those Asuras were defeated.
2.5.114	The second (verse) is the same as this, and it is offered to his own self with the Vasat-utterance.
2.5.115	The sacrificer asks for satisfaction, saying, "May the heat fall on the Asvins."
2.5.116	Then it becomes the Vasat-uttered.
2.5.117	The Brahman recites the verse, "All directions are the Dakshina," consecrating the oblation.
2.5.118	That becomes offered to his own Self.
2.5.102	He says, "Go to heaven, go to the sky, go to the earth, go to the five directions." Thus he satisfies these worlds and the directions with the hot offering.
2.5.103	"Go to the gods who drink hot offerings."
2.5.104	He thus satisfies those gods who drink hot offering with the hot offering in this way.
2.5.105	He offers with the formula, "To you, Obeisance to the gods who offer hot offerings," with the Upāmantrana formula to the great hero.
2.5.119	"Pour for the Iṣa, pour for the Urja", he thus places the Iṣa and the Urja in the sacrifice.
2.5.120	"Pour for this Brahman, pour for this Ksatra, pour for this Vis, pour for this Sunvata, pour for this Yajamana", he thus makes the Brahman, Ksatra, Vis, Sunvata and Yajamana to be sharers.
2.5.121	"Pour to this Sunvata, to this Yajamāna", he thus prays for a blessing to the Yajamana.
2.5.106-112	Those very gods who drink the Gharma, he thereby satisfies them in the Gharma. The gods and the Asuras performed the Pravargya together. Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did.

2.5.122	"May you be prosperous!" he says, and he himself becomes prosperous.
2.5.123	"May you have brahmic glory!" he says, he himself becomes brahmic glory.
2.5.124	"May I have life, radiance, seniority, prosperity, good offspring, and prosperity!" he says, this is the blessing he himself invokes.
2.5.113	Those Asuras were defeated.
2.5.114	The second (verse) is the same as this, and it is offered to his own self with the Vasat-utterance.
2.5.115	The sacrificer asks for satisfaction, saying, "May the heat fall on the Asvins."
2.5.116	Then it becomes the Vasat-uttered.
2.5.117	The Brahman recites the verse, "All directions are the Dakshina," consecrating the oblation.
2.5.118	That becomes offered to his own Self.
2.5.125	He offers the vessel to the right, saying, "For Tvisti thee, for Dyumna thee, for prosperity thee, for Indra thee."
2.5.126	He makes the directions his sharers, for the sake of non-injury to himself.
2.5.127	"Thou art Dharma, thou art Sudharma, thou art the Brahman, thou art the Brahmana."
2.5.128	Indeed Agni is Rudra.
2.5.129	Just as one offers to Agni, so does he do this.
2.5.130	He offers the Agnihotra with the formula, "To Agni, the most Indra-like, I offer the oblation, the honeyed oblation, on earth, in heaven, svāhā."
2.5.131	This is indeed the form of heaven.
2.5.132	Then he offers mentally to Prajapati, so as not to be interrupted.
2.5.133	Prajapati is indeed like the mind.
2.5.134	The sacrifice is Prajapati.

2.5.124	"May I have life, radiance, seniority, prosperity, good offspring, and prosperity!" he says, this is the blessing he himself invokes.
2.5.136	They discuss whether one should eat or not.
2.5.137	If one eats, one becomes a glutton.
2.5.138	If one does not eat, one becomes a non-eater.
2.5.139	One should smell.
2.5.140	One does both.
2.5.141	The sacrificer himself eats.
2.5.142	He places the Brahman-splendour in himself.
2.5.143	When the oblation is being mixed, he says, "Recite."
2.5.125	He offers the vessel to the right, saying, "For Tvisti thee, for Dyumna thee, for prosperity thee, for Indra thee."
2.5.126	He makes the directions his sharers, for the sake of non-injury to himself.
2.5.127	"Thou art Dharma, thou art Sudharma, thou art the Brahman, thou art the Brahmana."

2.5.130	He offers the Agnihotra with the formula, "To Agni, the most Indra-like, I offer the oblation, the honeyed oblation, on earth, in heaven, svāhā."
2.5.131	This is indeed the form of heaven.
2.5.132	Then he offers mentally to Prajapati, so as not to be interrupted.
2.5.133	Prajapati is indeed like the mind.
2.5.134	The sacrifice is Prajapati.
2.5.135	He indeed sustains the sacrifice.
3.1.11-17	He who knows this becomes prosperous. "The two who are in the heaven of the sun, make me the one with sight in this world." "May I be the one with sight here in this world."

1.3.8.5	They are twenty-five in number. The Self is twenty-five, Prajapati is twenty-five. There are ten fingers, ten toes, two thighs, two arms, the Self is twenty- five. He makes this Self twenty-five.
1.3.8.6	Now this is the twenty-fifth day, and the twenty-fifth is the Stoma of this day. Thus he attains the even by the even. Therefore there are two twenty-fives.
1.3.8.7	Thus is the twenty-five in the Self.
1.3.8.8	Now the twenty-five as the Supernal.
1.3.8.9	The eye, the ear, the mind, speech, and the breath-these five deities enter this person. Five deities indeed enter this person.
1.3.8.10	Here, from the hair and nails, he is completely obtained with all his limbs. Therefore, all beings are obtained from the ants. They are born as such.
1.3.8.11	This was said by the sage:
1.3.8.12	"The Udgātṛ recites the Sāman in the form of 'Sahasradhā pañcadaśāni ukthāni' (i.e. the Udgātṛ chants the Sāman as 'Sahasradha pañcadaśāny ukthāni'). The Udgātṛ says, 'Sahasradhā pañcadaśāṇi ukthāni'. The Udgātā says, 'Sahasrādha pañcadaśānī ukthāni.' The Udgātār says, 'Sahāsrādha pañcada-śānī ukathāni.' The Sāman is recited in the form of Sahasradhā pañcadasāni ukthānī. There are five fifteenths in a thousand. As much as heaven and earth, so much is the Self."
1.3.8.13	"The Udgātā recites the Sāmā in the form of ‘Sahasradhā mahīyāni ukthāny’ (i.e., the Udgātā chants the Sāma as ‘Sahasradha mahīyāni ukhāni’). The Udgātāra says, ‘Sahasradhāmāhiyāni ukthānīm.’ The Udgātāt says, ‘Sahāsrādhamāhiyāni ukhānīm.’ The Sāman has been recited in the form ‘Sahasradhamāhiyāny ukthāny.’ The Udg
1.3.8.14	"As far as Brahma extends, so far does speech extend." Where there is Brahma, there is speech; where there is speech, there is Brahma. This is what is said.
1.3.8.15	Of these hymns, the first has nine verses. There are nine vital airs; for the fulfilment of the vital airs.
1.3.8.16	It has sixty verses. There are six seasons; for the fulfilment (of the seasons).
1.3.8.17	It consists of five verses; the Pankti has five feet; the Pankti is food; for the securing of food.
1.3.8.18	It consists of three verses.
1.3.8.19	These three worlds are threefold; for the conquest of these worlds.
1.3.8.20	They meet together; the Brihatî metre, the world of the gods, this is the Self.
1.3.8.21	Thus indeed, he who knows this, by means of this (Sutra), attains to the immortal Self, and becomes prosperous.
1.4.1.1	Now the Sutra-milkings.
1.4.1.2	The Sutra-milkings are the vital airs. By means of the vital airs, he unites the joints.
1.4.1.3	Now the neck.
1.4.1.4	They say that it is according to the metre, the Ushnih.
1.4.1.5	Now the Sūtra-milkings. The Sūtra-milking is the vital airs.
1.4.1.6	By means of the vital air, he unites the parts.
1.4.1.7	Now, then, the head.
1.4.1.8	It is in the Gāyatrī verses, for the Gāyatrīs are the foremost of the metres, and the head is the foremost of the limbs.
1.4.1.9	It is found in the Arka verses, for Agni is the Arka.
1.4.1.10	They are nine, for the head has nine cavities.
1.4.1.11	He recites the tenth, for the skin and hair are indeed it.
1.4.1.12	And also for the excess of Stoma.
1.4.1.13	These two are the Trivṛt and Gāyatrī Stoma and Chandaḥ. In accordance with the propagation of these two Stoma and Chando, all this is propagated, whatever is propagated.
1.4.1.14	He who knows this, propagates with offspring and cattle.
1.4.1.15	Now the Sūdadohas.
1.4.1.16	Sūdadohas are indeed the vital breath. He joins the joints with vital breath.
1.4.1.17	Now about Vijavas.
1.4.1.18	They are Viraj. Therefore one man says to another, 'You rule over us.' 'You hold the neck,' (he says), because he is supporting (it). When the messengers of the gods, the most truthful, the most truthful of all, have come to the most truthful, they have come to food, for Viraj is food, and food is strength.
1.4.1.19	Now the Sudadohas.
1.4.1.20	The Sudadohas are the breath. He joins the joints with the breath.
1.4.2.1	Now, then, the right wing.
1.4.2.2	This world is that Agni, that is speech, that is Rathantara, that is Vasishtha, that is a hundred, those are the six powers.
1.4.2.3	The Paṅkti is for the attainment of desires, for stability, for food.
1.4.2.4	Now, the Sūddhodhas.
1.4.2.5	The Sūddhodha is the breath; he joins the joints with breath.
1.4.2.6	Now, then, the northern section.
1.4.2.7	That is the world, that is the sun, that is the mind, that is the great one, that is Bharadvaja, those are the hundred, those are the six powers.
1.4.2.8	The Paṅkti is established for the attainment of desires, for stability, for food.
1.4.2.9-11	They are deficient and excessive. The male is the greater, the female the lesser. The excess is of the male, the deficiency of the female. Therefore they are deficient and excessive.
1.4.2.12	The Sudodhas are the vital airs; he unites the joints with the vital airs.
1.4.2.13	Now, then, the tail.
1.4.2.14	They are twenty-one feet, for there are twenty-one feathers of the bird Suparna.
1.4.2.15	And the twenty-one is the foundation of the Stoma, the tail is the foundation of cattle.
1.4.2.16	He recites the twenty-two verses for the sake of stability. This is the form of stability. Therefore all animals stand on their tails. They fly up with their tails. The tail is stability.
1.4.2.17	This man is established on these two twenty-two verses, which are Viraj and have two feet.
1.4.2.18	His Suparna form is for the attainment of his desires.
1.4.2.19	His Purusha form is for his prosperity, fame, food and nourishment.
1.4.2.20	Now the Sooda Doha.
1.4.2.21	Now the Dhayyas.
1.4.2.22	Now the Suddoha.
1.4.2.23	The bull is the Suddoha, the woman is the Dhayyā. He recites the Dhayyā from both sides of the Suddoha. Therefore, when the semen is deposited in two places, it becomes one. He knows that the woman is the source of offspring. Therefore, he recites to her here.
1.4.3.1	He recites the Gāyatrī with eighty-three syllables. This world is the Gāyatri. The eighty-three syllables are the fame, the greatness, the pair, the food, the nourishment, and the prosperity in this world. He desires to obtain them, to attain them, to possess them. They are mine.
1.4.3.2	Then the Sūdadohas.
1.4.3.3	The Sooda-dohas are indeed the vital airs. He sustains this world by the vital airs.
1.4.3.4	He recites the Barhaspatya verses eighty in number. The Barhaspatya is the world of the atmosphere. Whatever fame, whatever greatness, whatever pair, whatever food, whatever prosperity there is in the world of the sky, that he obtains, that he attains, that he wins, that belongs to me.
1.4.3.5	Now the Sūddhodhas.
1.4.3.6	The Sūddhodha is the vital breath. By the vital breath he connects the aerial world.
1.4.3.7	He recites the Ushniha verses eighty-three times. This world is Ushniha, eighty-three. Whatever fame, whatever greatness, whatever pair, whatever food, whatever prosperity there is in this world, whatever is divine among the gods, that he knows, that he obtains, that he attains, that belongs to him.
1.4.3.8	Now the Sudadohas.
1.4.3.9	The Sooda-dohas are indeed the vital breath. He sustains this world by the vital breath.
1.5.1.1	He praises the control, saying, "All this is under my control."
1.5.1.2	They are twenty-one in number, for there are twenty-one transformations inside the belly.
1.5.1.3	And the twenty-one is indeed the foundation of the Stotras, and the belly is the foundation of food.
1.5.1.4	They are the metres, for they are the metres. The smallest thing is the smallest, and the largest is the largest.
1.5.1.5	He recites them with the Praṇava and the metre-maker, as they are, for the smallest thing is as it is, the smaller is smaller, and the larger is larger.
1.5.1.6	Then the Sūddhodhas. The Sūddhodha is the vital airs. He unites the joints with the vital airs.
1.5.1.7-8	Having recited it twelve times, he releases it here. The vital airs are of twelve kinds here: seven in the head, two in the breasts, and three below. Here the vital airs are obtained, here they are purified. Therefore he releases it here.
1.5.1.9	They are six feet long. Man is indeed established in two ways. Animals have four feet. He thus establishes the sacrificer in two ways and in animals with four feet.
1.5.1.10	The second one has seven feet. He makes it Gāyatrī and Anushtubh. Gāyatrī is indeed Brahman, Anushtubh is speech. Thus he unites speech with Brahman.
1.5.1.11	He recites the Tristubh verse at the end. The Tristubh is vigour. By means of vigour he approaches the cattle. Therefore cattle follow vigour. It is the attainment and the rising.
1.5.2.1	"He places the offering in the Indra-Agni verse, "For you, O great, for the moving Soma..." He places it in the Indra-only verse. He places it in a verse which is directly related to himself. He places vigour directly in himself.
1.5.2.2	They are Tristubh and Jagati verses.
1.5.2.3	They say, "Why does he place the Nidhana in Tristubh and Lagati verses?"
1.5.2.4	Because in this day no one placed the Nidhana in any one of the metres or explained it, therefore he places the Nidhana in the Tristubh and Gagati verses.
1.5.2.5	This day is to be known as having three Nivits. The Nivit of Vasu, the Nivit of Valakhilya, and the Nivit itself. Thus one should know it as having three Nivit.
1.5.2.6	Then (the verse) "He who has laid down in the forest, he who has desired, he who, even as born, is the first intelligent one" - there is a similarity between these two in food. The meaning is that there is a similarity in the food of these two. For the purpose of obtaining food.
1.5.2.7	Now, as for sowing: Those who sow between the ten verses of Indra and the verses of the Tristubh and Jagati metres, which are completed by the Brihatis, live for as many years above the sowing as they sow. By this sowing indeed, one attains longevity.
1.5.2.8	"One's offspring and cattle may prosper." Thus one recites the Sajanīya verse.
1.5.2.9	He recites the Tarksya hymn. The Tarksya is a hymn for welfare. He makes it a hymn for welfare for himself.
1.5.2.10	He recites the Ekapada hymn. Everything is one here. He obtains all the forms of the Chhandas.
1.5.2.11	"They have increased Indra, the All-knowing." These are the supplementary verses. He recites them seven times. There are seven vital airs in the head. He thus places the vital airs in the (sacrificer's) head. He does not recite the eighth verse. The eighth is speech. He thinks, "May my speech not be separated from the vital airs." Therefore, speech is of the same abode as the vital airs, and is not separated from them.
1.5.2.12	Viraj is praised. Food is Viraj. For the attainment of food.
1.5.2.13	He places it with Vasishtha's verse, "May Vasishtha be mine."
1.5.2.14	This is the Stoma, the great, for the fierce one. With the great and prosperous form.
1.5.2.15	The one who is like a ploughman, yoking for speed. The end is the plough, this is the form of this day.
1.5.2.16-17	Indra, this is your light, the light of the Vasus. Like the sky above the sky, may we have prosperity. Wherever the Brahmanical speech is raised, there his fame becomes. One who knows this should offer it with this. Therefore one who knows this should make an offering with this.
1.5.3.1	We choose the Savitr of that (Savitr). Today, O god Savitr, is the verse and the follower of the verse of the Vaishvadev. They are of the same form and are performed on the same day. On this day, whatever is done for protection, it is for peace. Peace is the one-day (rite). It is for peace and for the establishment. At the end, they establish themselves in peace.
1.5.3.2	He who knows this, and the Hotr who knows this and recites it, stands firm.
1.5.3.3	"That is the great gift of Savitar, the god." This is the Savitri verse. The great one is the end; this day is the end of that day.
1.5.3.4	"Which is the earlier, which the later?" This is the Dyava-Prithivi verse. The later day has the same rising as the earlier day. This is the form of that day.
1.5.3.5	The unperishing, the unborn, the praiseworthy, is the Ārbhava.
1.5.3.6	The chariot with three wheels, whatever this is three-fold, that is the end. The three-fold is the end. This is the form of this day.
1.5.3.7	Of this left-handed, grey-haired Hotr, is the Vaishvadeva. The many-formed is the many-formed. This is the many-form of this day.
1.5.3.8-9	The verses beginning with "The tawny ones, searching the waters, are purifying" and ending with "May our good rites come from all sides" are the verses for the Vaishvadev offering. The verses for the Nivi-dhana offering are the verses for a single day. There is a lot of ritual activity on this day. Everything that is done is for peace. Peace is indeed the foundation. The single day is for peace. Thus, they attain peace and foundation.
1.5.3.10	He who knows this, and for whom the Hotr recites this knowing this, stands firm.
1.5.3.11	"The inspiration to Vaisvânara, the increaser of truth," is the first verse of the Agni-Marut-sâman. The inspiration is the end; this is the form of this day.
1.5.3.12	The Maruts, the shining ones, have offered sacrifice. This is the Marut hymn. The Marut hymn has a similar form. This day has a similar form to that day.
1.5.3.13	We pour out Soma to Jātavedas. He recites the Jātavedasyā hymn before the hymn. The Jātavedsyā is for well-being. He makes it well-being.
2.1.1.4	The sage has said this.
2.1.1.5	The three classes of creatures went away, and others entered around the sun. The great one remained in the worlds, Pavamana entered the green ones.
2.1.1.6	The three kinds of creatures went away - those who went away are these three kinds of creatures, the Bengalis, the Avgadhas, and the Cerpadas.
2.1.1.7	"They have entered around the sun, the other ones." These creatures have entered around the Sun, this Agni.
2.1.1.8	"He stood in the worlds, the great one." The great one indeed stands in the worlds, that Aditya.
2.1.1.9	"Pavamana has entered the green ones." Pavamana indeed is the Wind, the green ones are the directions.
2.1.2.1	The people say, "Utkha, Utkha." This is the Utkha. This very earth is the Utkham. From this everything that is here arises.
2.1.2.2	Of that, Agni is the light, food is the heat. By food, everything here is nourished.
2.1.2.3	The Uktha is the atmosphere. They follow the atmosphere, they run after the atmosphere. Its wind is the sun, its food is the food. By food everything here prospers.
2.1.2.4-6	That very heaven is the praise. From the bestowal of that, everything here, whatever it is, rises up. That sun is the food of that. The food is eaten by everything here.
2.1.2.7	The man himself is the Uktha, he himself is the great Prajapati. One should know that one is the Uktha.
2.1.2.8	His mouth itself is the Uktha; just as the earth is so.
2.1.2.9	His speech is the sun, food is the cold. Everything here is sustained by food.
2.1.2.10	The nose itself is the Ukthā; just as the atmosphere is so.
2.1.2.11	His breath is the sun, food is the heat. By food, everything here eats.
2.1.2.12	That is the expanse of the Brahman, which is bent like the nose.
2.1.2.13	The forehead is indeed the Uktha, as the sky.
2.1.2.14	His eye is the sun, the food is the heat, by food, everything here consumes.
2.1.2.15	The food of the gods is the same as the food of the self. All beings are nourished by food. By food one conquers this world, by food the other world. Therefore, the food of the gods and the food of the Self are the same.
2.1.2.16	This food is eaten by the eater. This earth alone is the source of all this that is here.
2.1.2.17	Whatever is moved by the wind, that is eaten by the wind. Whatever is moved by the sun, that is eaten here by the sun. This is the eater.
2.1.2.18	The eater is indeed the first.
2.1.2.19	He is not the lord of that which he does not enjoy, nor of that which he will not enjoy.
2.1.3.1	Now, then, the creation of semen.
2.1.3.2	Prajapati is the seed, the gods are the seed of the gods, the rain is the seed of the rain, the plants are the seed of plants, food is the seed of food, the seed is the seed of seed, the offspring are the seed of offspring, the heart is the seed of heart, the mind is the seed of mind, speech is the seed of speech, action is the seed of action, this action is performed, this person is the world of Brahman.
2.1.3.3	He is made of gold, because he is made of gold. Therefore he is made of golden.
2.1.3.4	He who knows this becomes golden in the yonder world, and is seen by all beings.
2.1.4.1	He approached him with his feet. Since he approached him with his two feet, therefore they call them 'feet'. The hooves are the hoofs of other animals.
2.1.4.2	Then it moved upwards. Those became the thighs.
2.1.4.3	He said, "Sing loudly." That became the belly.
2.1.4.4	He said "Make it firm." That became the chest.
2.1.4.5	The Sharakaras and the Akshas meditate on the belly as Brahman, the Arunas meditate on the heart as Brahman, the Brahmas are indeed those two.
2.1.4.6	It moved upwards. That became the head. That became the Head. That is the supremacy of the head.
2.1.4.7	These are the glories that have resorted to the head. The eye, the ear, the mind, speech, and the breath.
2.1.4.8	Those who know thus the supremacy of the Head, the glories resort to it.
2.1.4.9	They did not harm each other, saying, "I am the eulogy, I am the eulogy."
2.1.4.10	They said, "Let us emerge from this body. Whatever enters that body when we have emerged, that will be the eulogy."
2.1.4.11	Speech emerged. One who speaks, eats, drinks, and remains.
2.1.4.12	The eye departed, and he saw, ate, and drank, as before.
2.1.4.13	The ear departed, and he heard, ate, and drunk, as before. The mind departed, and he ate, drank, and remained as before.
2.1.4.14	Breath departed, and he remained as if dead.
2.1.4.15	When the breath departed, he became dead.
2.1.4.16	It became rotten, and that became the body. That became the body of the body.
2.1.4.17	His enemy, the evil one, his foe, falls away. He who knows this, his enemy, the evil foe, falls away from him.
2.1.4.18	They did not injure each other, saying, "I am the eulogy, I am the eulogy."
2.1.4.19	They said, "Let us enter this body again. That which will rise up in this body when we have entered it will be the eulogy."
2.1.4.20-26	Speech entered him while he was lying down. The eye entered him while he lay down. The ear entered him while he lie down. The mind entered him while he lain down. The breath entered him while he laid down. He who has resorted to the breath stood up. That became the Utkha. That is this Utkha. The breath itself is Utkha. One should know that the breath is Utkha.
2.1.4.27	The gods said to him, "You are the praise." "You are all this. We are yours. You are ours."
2.1.4.28	This was also said by the sage:
2.1.4.29	"You are ours. We are yours."
2.1.5.1	The gods breathed him forth, and he, being breathed forth, stretched forth, stretched forth. That became morning. He came together, that became evening. The breath is the day, the out-breath is the night.
2.1.5.2	Speech is Agni, the eye is the sun, the mind is the moon, the directions are the ears, and this is the union of the released. These are the divine beings in the inner self. They have come forth in the outer self. This is what is said.
2.1.5.3	Now, indeed, he who knows this, says, "He who knows gold, he is the lord, for they would not give me what is mine." He knows that the offering made to him is established in the union with the Self.
2.1.5.4	Indeed, those beings who know this offer their oblations to him without being commanded.
2.1.5.5-6	That is the truth, that is the breath, that is the food, that is the sun. This is the three-fold. The eye is like the three-fold, white, black and the pupil.
2.1.6.1	His speech is the string, his names are the reins. This is his speech, the string, and his names, the reins. All this is white, all this is named. All this is spoken by speech.
2.1.6.2	He who knows this, indeed, is bound by the string.
2.1.6.3	His hair is the Usnih metre, his skin the Gāyatrī, his flesh the Tristubh, his bones the Anushtubh, his marrow the Jagatī, his breath the Pankti, his vital airs the Brihatī. He is covered by the metres. Because he is covered by the Metres, therefore they call him the Metres.
2.1.6.4	The metres indeed cover him from evil deeds in whatever direction he may desire. He who knows the truth of the metres knows this.
2.1.6.5	This has been said by the Rishi:
2.1.6.6	"I saw the protector" - this indeed is the protector, for he protects all this.
2.1.6.7	"Not resting" - for he never sleeps.
2.1.6.8	He who moves along the paths, both this and the other world. For he moves along the paths of both this and the next world.
2.1.6.9	He wears the bright and the dark (robes). For he wears the bright and dark directions.
2.1.6.10	He moves around in the worlds, within the worlds. For he moves around in the world, within the worlds.
2.1.6.11	Then, indeed, the covered and the uncovered are not covered by the agents. For everything here is covered by the breath.
2.1.6.12	This space is stabilized by the breath in the great one. Just as this space is stabilized by breath in the great, so all beings up to ants are stabilized by breath in a great one. One should know thus.
2.1.7.1	Now, then, about the abundance of this person.
2.1.7.2	In the creation by speech, the earth and fire are the parents of speech. Plants grow on the earth, and fire makes them tasty. They serve their parent speech by saying, "Bring this," and "Bring that." Thus, the earth and the fire serve speech.
2.1.7.3	As far as the earth extends, as far as the fire extends, so far is his world. His world does not decay as long as these two do not decay, the earth and the fire. He who knows this greatness of speech.
2.1.7.4	The wind and the atmosphere are created by the breath. The wind moves in the atmosphere and listens to it. The wind brings him a fragrant smell. Thus these two serve the father, the breath, and the atmosphere and the wind.
2.1.7.5	As far as the atmosphere extends, as far as the wind extends, so far is his world. His world does not decay as long as these two do not decay, the atmosphere and the wind. He who knows this extent of the vital breath.
2.1.7.6	The sky and the sun are the creation of the eye. The sky gives him rain and food, the sun makes his light and illumination. Thus the sky and the sun serve the father, the eye.
2.1.7.7	As far as heaven and the sun extend, so far extends his world. His world does not decay as long as these two, heaven and the sun, do not decay. He who knows this extent of the eye.
2.1.7.8	The directions are produced by the ear, and the moon by the directions. He hears the directions coming to him from the directions. The moon arranges for him the bright and dark fortnights for the sake of meritorious deeds. Thus these directions and the moon serve the ear as their father.
2.1.7.9	As far as the directions and the moon extend, so far extends his world. His world does not decay as long as these directions and the moon do not decay. He who knows this greatness of the ear.
2.1.7.10	The waters, created by the mind, and Varuna, bow to him for a meritorious deed. Varuna supports his progeny by righteousness. Thus these waters and Varuna serve the father.
2.1.7.11	As far as the waters extend, as far as Varuṇa extends, so far his world is. His world does not decay as long as these, the waters and Varuṇa, do not decay. He who knows this extent of the mind.
2.1.8.1	"Aapa" is the same as "Apa". This is indeed the root, the wool, the father, and the sons. Wherever there is a son, there is a father, or wherever there is a father there is a son. This is what is said.
2.1.8.2	Now, indeed, he who knew this said, "I know the gods from myself and myself from the gods. For they are givers and receivers of gifts."
2.1.8.3	This is the mountain, the eye, the ear, the mind, speech, and the breath. They call it the mountain of Brahman.
2.1.8.4	He who knows this, indeed, conquers his enemy, the evil one, his foe. His enemy, the evil foe, is conquered.
2.1.8.5	He is indeed the Asura, he is indeed the Prāṇa, he is indeed Bhūti and Abhūti.
2.1.8.6	The gods worshipped him as Bhūti, and they became prosperous. Therefore, even now, when asleep, one breathes with the word "Bhūḥ."
2.1.8.7	The Asuras worshipped him as Abhūti, and those Asuras were defeated.
2.1.8.8	One who knows this becomes prosperous by oneself. One's enemy, sin, becomes one's brother.
2.1.8.9	This is indeed both death and immortality.
2.1.8.10	The sage has said this.
2.1.8.11	"He goes forward with the Apana, holding the Apana, for from the Apana this Prāṇa does not go away."
2.1.8.12	"He is immortal, united with the mortal, of the same origin; for this (Apana) is the origin of all this, and these bodies are mortal, and this deity is immortal."
2.1.8.13	Those who are always shining, who are far-reaching, who are in the sky, who are not one and who are not many, they indeed are the ones who are binding these bodies. This indeed is the immortal deity.
2.1.8.14	He who knows this, he who knows this, indeed becomes immortal in the world beyond, and is seen by all beings.
2.2.1.1	This one worshipped this world in the form of a man, he who shines yonder. The breath indeed worshipped it, for the breath is he who shines yonder.
2.2.1.2	He worshipped him for a hundred years. Therefore, the human life span is a hundred years. Because he worshipped him for a full hundred years, he is called Śatṛcin. They call him Śatṛcin because he is indeed that.
2.2.1.3	He placed all this in the middle, whatever there is. Whatever there is, he placed in the middle. Therefore they are called Madhyamas. They call him who is present.
2.2.1.4	Prāṇa is Gṛtsamada, Apāna is Madhu. Since Prāṇa is Grtsamada and Apāna is Madu, therefore it is Grtsamad. Therefore they call him Grtsamad, though he is the same.
2.2.1.5	His friend was this whole world, whatever there is. Since this whole world, whate'er there is, was his friend, therefore he is called Visvamitra. He is the same as this.
2.2.1.6	The gods said to him, "This is our common (property)." Because the gods said to him "This is our property in common", therefore he is called Vamadeva. They call him by this name.
2.2.1.7	He is the protector of all this from evil. Whatever there is here, he is the protector of it from evil. Whatever is here, he protects it from evil. Therefore, he is called 'Atrayas'. He is the protector.
2.2.2.1	He is indeed the one who bears the strength. The creatures are strength. He bears them. Because he bears, he is Bharadvāja. Therefore they call him Bharadvāja.
2.2.2.2	The gods said to him, "This is indeed the most excellent one among all of us." Because the gods said to him "This is indeed our most excellent one," therefore he is called Vasishtha. He is indeed the one who exists.
2.2.2.3	He went forth from this entire world, whatever there is. Since he went forth from this whole world, whatever there was, therefore they call him 'the one who went forth'.
2.2.2.4	He covered all this, whatever there is. Because he covered all this,whatever there is, therefore they call him Pavamana, therefore they call this one Pavamana.
2.2.2.5	He said, "I am all this, both the small and the great." They became the small and great hymns. Therefore they are called the small and great. He is the same.
2.2.2.6	It is indeed a good saying. That is why it is called a Sūkta. That is why they call it Sūkta. It is indeed this one.
2.2.2.7	This is indeed the Rg Veda. For it shines on all these beings. Because it shines on all beings, it is Rg Veda. That is why the Rg Veda is called Rg Veda. It is indeed that one.
2.2.2.8	This is the Half-sacrifice, for he sacrifices to all these half-sacrifices. Because he sacrifices to all the half-sacrifices, therefore it is called Half-sacrifice. They call him who is this (the Half-sacrifice).
2.2.2.9	This is the foot, for this one is the foot of all these beings. Because this one is the feet of all these beings, therefore it is called foot. This one is the foot.
2.2.2.10	This is the imperishable, for it is imperishable from all these beings. And they do not pass beyond it. In that it is imperishable for all these beings and they do not pass it, therefore it is imperishable. Therefore they call it imperishable. It is this that exists.
2.2.2.11	All these are the verses, all the Vedas, all the sounds, one is the Vyāhṛti, and the breath itself is the breath. One should know this.
2.2.3.1	For this day, indeed, Indra approached Viśvāmitra, who was about to recite.
2.2.3.2	Having uttered the word "food" first, he recited the thousand verses of the Brihatī. By that he attained Indra's beloved abode.
2.2.3.3	Indra said to him, "O Rishi, you have come to my dear abode. Now, O Rishi, sing the second one."
2.2.3.4	He uttered the word "food" and sang the Brihatisahasra. By that he reached Indra's dear abode.
2.2.3.5	Indra said to him, “O Rishi, you came to my dear abode, now, O Rishi, chant the third one.”
2.2.3.6	He, having spoken only the word "food", praised the thousand verses of the Brihatī. By that he attained Indra's beloved abode.
2.2.3.7	Indra said to him, "O sage, you have indeed attained my beloved abode. I shall give you a boon."
2.2.3.8	He said, "I should know you."
2.2.3.9	Indra said to him, "I am indeed the vital breath, O sage. You are the vital breath. The vital breath is all beings. This is the vital breath, he who shines thus. He has pervaded all directions in this form. My food is my friend, my right. This is Vaishvamitra. He is indeed shining."
2.2.4.1	This is the great thousand. Its letters are its body. The sound is the Self. The heat is the breath.
2.2.4.2	He who knew this became Vasishtha. From that he obtained this name.
2.2.4.3	This indeed Indra told to Visvamitra, this indeed Indra told to Bharadvaja. Therefore he is offered in sacrifices by that relation.
2.2.4.4	Now this is the Great Thousand (verses) that has been accomplished. Of this Great Thousand (verses), which has been accomplished, there are sixty-three thousand syllables. There are as many thousands of days in a hundred years. By the consonants they obtain the nights, by the vowels the days.
2.2.4.5	This is the complete Brihatisahasra. Beyond this complete Brihatisahasrā, the deity of wisdom, the deity of knowledge, the deity of Brahman, the deity of immortality, having come together, goes to the deity. He who knows this thus.
2.2.4.6	He who am I, he is that. He who is that, he am I.
2.2.4.7	This has been said by the sage.
2.2.4.8	The sun is the Self of the world and of the standing.
2.2.4.9	This alone is to be disregarded.
2.3.1.1	He who knows the five-fold Self, from which all this arises, he knows the truth.
2.3.1.2	Earth, Wind, Space, Water, Light - this is the five-fold praise of the Self. From this everything arises and into this everything merges.
2.3.1.3	He who knows this attains the common goal of all.
2.3.1.4	He who understands the food and the eater in this, he is born as the eater in this and becomes its food.
2.3.1.5	Water, earth, and food are the same, for food is made of these. Light and wind are the same, since everything here eats food through them. Space is the same, since all this is contained in space.
2.3.1.6	He who knows this becomes the same as all things.
2.3.1.7	In this (universe) he who knows the food and the eater of food, in this (universe) the eater of food is born, and his food becomes (this universe).
2.3.1.8	Plants and trees are food, and those who sustain life are the eaters of food, for those who sustain life eat plants and trees.
2.3.1.9	Those of them that have teeth on both sides are the eaters of food, and the others are the animals. Therefore they graze upon the other animals, for the eater of food is above the food.
2.3.1.10	He who knows this becomes superior to his equals.
2.3.2.1	He who understands his own self in detail obtains more than the share.
2.3.2.2	The plants and trees, and all that has life, know their own self in detail.
2.3.2.3	For the juice is seen in plants and trees, but the mind is seen in those that have life.
2.3.2.4	But the self is known in detail only in those that have breath, for the juice is seen there, but not the mind in the others.
2.3.2.5	But in the case of man, the Self is not so detailed. For he is the most perfect in wisdom. He speaks what is known, sees what is known, knows what is past, knows the world and the non-world, desires the mortal and the immortal. Thus perfect.
2.3.2.6	Now the other animals, indeed, know only by means of hunger and thirst, but they do not speak what is known, nor do they see what is known, they do not know the past, nor the world and the non-world. They are only as much as their knowledge allows.
2.3.3.1	This man is the ocean, he is beyond the whole world.
2.3.3.2	Whatever he obtains, he thinks that he has obtained it. If he obtains the world of the atmosphere, he thinks that it is obtained. If he obtains this world, he thinks that this is obtained.
2.3.3.3	This person is of five kinds. His heat is fire, his cavities are space, his blood, phlegm and semen are water, his body is earth, and his breath is wind.
2.3.3.4	This wind is of five kinds: prāṇa, apāna, vyāna, udāna and samāna.
2.3.3.5	These deities are established in the Prāṇa and Apāna, namely, the eye, ear, mind, and speech. For these deities follow the Prāṇa when it goes out.
2.3.3.6	This is the successive order of speech and mind, that is, the sacrifice.
2.3.3.7	This sacrifice is of five kinds: Agnihotra, Darsha-Pūrṇamāsa, Cāturmāsya, Pasu, and Soma.
2.3.3.8	This is the most perfect of sacrifices, because Soma is used in it. For in this (sacrifice) five kinds are attained: that which is before the Savanas is one kind, the three Savanas are three kinds, and that which is after is the fifth kind.
2.3.4.1	He who knows the sacrifice in the sacrifice, he knows the god who is mounted on the gods every day.
2.3.4.2	This is the sacrifice at the sacrifice, the god among the gods, the great praise which is raised up daily.
2.3.4.3	This is the fivefold, threefold, fifteenfold, seventeenfold, twenty-onefold, twenty-fivefold, and twenty-sevenfold. This is the Gāyatrī, Rājan, and Bṛhat. This is the Gayatri, Uṣṇīṣa, Bṛhatī, and Triṣṭubh. This is the head, the right wing, the left wing, the tail, and the self. This is the narrative.
2.3.4.4	He recites five times, sings five times, responds five times, recites five times and concludes five times. Thus it becomes a thousand Stobha.
2.3.4.5	Thus these five kinds are praised. The one before the eighty-three verses is one kind, the three eighty-three verses are another kind, and the one above that is the fifth kind.
2.3.4.6	This is a thousand. All that is ten times ten. This is all. This is the extent of the number. Ten times ten is a hundred. Ten hundreds is a thousand. That is all.
2.3.4.7	These are the three metres. Food is divided into three parts: food, drink and snacks. One obtains them through these.
2.3.5.1	This is the Brihatī-sahasra (thousand) completed.
2.3.5.2	Now some know this as a thousand of different metres. What else can we say?
2.3.5.3	Some know it as a thousand of Tristubh, some as a thousand of Jagati, some as a Thousand of Anustubh.
2.3.5.4	This has been said by the Rishi:
2.3.5.5	Anustubh is being churned out, and Indra is being churned in the mind by the sages.
2.3.5.6	It is said thus: "They placed the vital breath of Indra in speech."
2.3.5.7	He who knows this becomes a lord, one with fame and good reputation. But he who knows this before his life ends, he indeed becomes a lord. Thus says Akrishna. For this Self is indeed complete, for when speech is controlled by the vital breath and the mind, it does not experience through speech.
2.3.5.8	One should compose the Brihatī verse. This is the entire Self, namely, the Brihatī.
2.3.5.9	This Self is surrounded on all sides by the bodies. Just as this Self is surrounded on every side by the bodies, so also the Brihatī is surrounded on every sides by the metres.
2.3.5.10	The Self is the middle of the limbs, and the Brihatī the middle of the metres.
2.3.5.11	He is the lord, the glorious one, the one of good fame. He is the lord who has gone to the other world. This is what Krsna said. The Brihatī is the whole Self. Therefore, one should attain the Brihatī.
2.3.6.1	This is the complete Brihatī-sahasra. Of this complete Brihatī Sahasra, there are eleven hundred Anushtubh verses and twenty-five Anushtubh. The greater is indeed taken by the lesser.
2.3.6.2	This has been said by the Rishi:
2.3.6.3	"I am the eight-footed speech." For there are eight four-syllabled feet.
2.3.6.4	"The Brihatī is made up of nine feet."
2.3.6.5	"The Rtaspṛśa (verse) is the truth, the speech is touched by the Rk."
2.3.6.6	"From Indra, my body." This is because the Brihatī Sahasra is made up of Anushtubh verses. Therefore, he creates the body of speech in the form of Anushtubha from the breath of Indra or from the Brihatī.
2.3.6.7	Now this is the highest modification of speech, namely, this great praise. It is fivefold, limited, unlimited, tone, truth and falsehood.
2.3.6.8	The Rig, the Gatha, the Kumbhya, that is limited. The Yajus, the Nigada, the idle speech, that is unlimited. The Sama and whatever else is sung, that is tone. Om is truth. No is falsehood.
2.3.6.9	This is the fruit of speech, that is, truth. He who speaks the truth becomes prosperous, famous and of good reputation. The fruit of speech is that it speaks the truth.
2.3.6.10	Now this is the root of speech, that which is false. Just as a tree with its roots exposed dries up and falls, so also one who speaks falsely makes himself rootless and dries up and falls.
2.3.6.11	Therefore, one should not speak untruth. One should be compassionate with it.
2.3.6.12	This is the empty syllable of others, namely, Oṃ. Whatever one says with Oṃ, it is filled here. If one were to use Oṃ in everything, one would be filling oneself. One would not be able to control one's desires.
2.3.6.13	This is full and internal, namely, Neti.
2.3.6.14	If he were to say, "It is not all," then his reputation would be bad. He should kill him there itself.
2.3.6.15	Therefore, one should give at the right time, and not give at the wrong time. He makes truth and falsehood unite. From their union, offspring are born. One becomes more.
2.3.6.16	He who knows that speech, whose this is the form, he knows everything.
2.3.6.17	The letter A is indeed all speech. It is expressed by touch and heat and becomes many, of various forms.
2.3.6.18	Of that, what is whispered is Prāṇa, and what is loud is the body. Therefore, that is as if hidden, for the bodyless is as if hidden. Prāṇa is indeed bodyless. And what is loud is indeed the body. Therefore it is manifest, for the body is indeed manifest.
2.3.7.1	This is the great thousand. It is fame. It is Indra. It is the lord of beings.
2.3.7.2	He who knows this Indra, the lord of beings, goes to the world of the gods. So said Mahidāsa Aitareya. Having gone to the world of Indra, he rules over these worlds.
2.3.7.3	They say that one is born in this world through this form. But through which form does one come to this world?
2.3.7.4	That which is blood in a woman is the form of Agni. Therefore, one should not despise it. And that which is semen in a man is the form of the sun. Therefore, one
2.3.7.5	This self gives this self to that self, and that self gives that self to this self. They unite with each other. By this form it goes to that world, and by that form it comes to this world.
2.3.8.1	Here are the verses on that:
2.3.8.2	What is the fivefold syllable that comes together, what is the yoke and the yoked that carry it? Where truth is yoked to truth, there all the gods become one.
2.3.8.3	What is the syllable that comes from the syllable, what is the yoked that carries it? Where truth comes together with truth, there all gods become one.
2.3.8.4	Whatever is the "Om" of speech, whatever is not, whatever is harsh in it, and whatever is harsh in the Ulbaṇiṣṇu, the sages have discovered that after removing it, they are satisfied with the name and knowledge.
2.3.8.5	In which the gods are all-united, having been satisfied with the name, there the learned one, having removed sin, attains the heavenly world with Brahman.
2.3.8.6	No one can say of him that he is a woman, or that he is a man, or that he does not exist.
2.3.8.7	"Brahman is thus: "I have come here."
2.3.8.8-9	Now this is the Great Thousand (verses) that has been accomplished. Of this Great Thousand (verses), which has been accomplished, there are sixty-three thousand verses. There are so many thousands of years of human life.
2.3.8.10	The chariot of the gods, without desire, has the wind as its axle, the speech as its pole, the ears as its wings, the eyes as its wheels, the mind as its yoke, and the Prāṇa as its controller.
2.3.8.11	This is said by the sage:
2.3.8.12	"He goes with that, faster than the mind, and the eye faster than that."
3.1.1.1	Now, here is the Upanishad of the Samhita.
3.1.1.2	The earth is the former form, the heaven is the latter form, the wind is the binding together, so Mandukayin knows. The space is the binding together so Makshavyan knows.
3.1.1.3	He thought, "He has not been surpassed by my son."
3.1.1.4	Agastya thought, "He was surpassed by one who is equal to him," for the wind and space are equal.
3.1.1.5	Thus is the divine aspect.
3.1.1.6	Now the human aspect.
3.1.1.7	The mouth is the earlier form, the mind is the later form, and the breath is the binding, says Shuravariro Mandukeya.
3.1.1.8	Then his son said, "The mind is the earlier form and the speech is the later form. One first conceives with the mind and then speaks with the speech. Therefore, the mind is indeed the earlier form and speech is the later. The breath alone is the binding."
3.1.1.9	The father and the son are equal here.
3.1.1.10	This is the chariot of horses, yoked with reins, united with mind, speech and life.
3.1.1.11	He who knows this collection thus, is united with offspring, cattle, fame, brahminical splendour, heaven, and world. He attains the whole of life.
3.1.1.12	Thus in the Mandukayanas.
5.1.1.1	The twenty-five Sāmidhenī verses of Mahāvrata.
5.1.1.2	Four verses beginning with "Agni" before the last verse of the twenty-one verses.
5.1.1.3	The bull of Viśvakarman, the reproachful, and the whispered.
5.1.1.4	The two verses beginning with "ajya" in the Viśvajit.
5.1.1.5	The Hotr verses from the twenty-four.
5.1.1.6	The Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin should recite the verse "Those who are looking at the sky" at the morning pressing, and "Protect me from the fierce one" at the midday pressing.
5.1.1.7	The Stotriya verse is "The buffalo in the Trikardrukas, the barley-eater."
5.1.1.8	O Indra, come to us from afar, for Indra the sky bent down, the Asura, to him the foremost chariot. From here on is the corresponding verse.
5.1.1.9	The Marutvatīya hymn has twenty-four verses. O Indra, the Maruts, the strong, the swift, the terrible, the drinkers of Soma, the destroyers, the good, the young, the nest-dwellers, the bulls, the fighters, the born, the terrible, and the strong, the Turāyas, the Maruts. This is the Marutvatīyī hymn.
5.1.1.10	When the Marutvatiya (hymn) has been recited, the Hotṛ, having gone out with the procedure of the Viṣam-sthita-sankra, offers three oblations of clarified butter on the Āgnīdhra fire with the Udumbara ladle.
5.1.1.11	May Indra follow me, may Brhaspati follow me, may Soma follow me, may the divine speech follow me, may Mitra-Varuna follow me here, may heaven and earth, the first invoked, follow me.
5.1.1.12	May the Adityas, the All-gods, protect me, the seven kings who are consecrated, Vayu, Pusan, Varuna, Soma, Agni, Surya, may they protect me here with the stars.
5.1.1.13	May the fathers, the entire world, and the mothers of Prisni, the Maruts of heaven, those with Agni as their tongue, or those who offer sacrifices, may those gods, the well-wishers, grant us protection."
5.1.1.14	In the south, on the Marjālīya (grass), he places ten fire-sticks, taking the first four-fold portion, and placing it to the north of the fire, and beginning with the Viharana (oblation), the Marjālīga becomes awake at midday. When that (fire) is surrounded, he offers (oblations). At the eastern gate, or at the northern gate, or at both the eastern and northern gates, he offers (the following oblations): "May I be like Agni, unassailable; like the earth, well-spread; like the sky, unapproachable; like heaven, unassaiilable; like the sun, unopposed; like the mind, new; like the wind, the source of praise; like the day, my own; like the night, dear; like cows, returning; like the pair, like the rays; like water, the taste; like plants, the form; like food, the pervader; like sacrifice, the lord; like Brahman, in the world; like the nobility, for prosperity. Whatever this assembly of Agni may be, here he divides the three without reciting the verse."
5.1.1.15	Standing here, he worships the sun. Having turned around in a clockwise direction, with these invocations of "svāhā" and "ehi" (come), he drinks this sweet juice, this sweet juice, and this intensely sweet juice. "This is sweet, this is sweet."
5.1.1.16	The slaves instruct the full pitchers, three of them are the lowest, six are the highest. They go around the altar and the pitcher three times to the right, striking their right thighs with their right hands, saying, "Come! This is honey! This is honey!"
5.1.2.1	Having performed the Stotra thrice, he should take it to the north and to the north of the Marjālīya mound. The remaining (Stotra) is to be recited within the altar.
5.1.2.2	Having circumambulated the fire and standing facing the east in front of the sacrificial post, facing the west, he stands at the head of the fire, saying, "Salutations to you, O Agni, in the Gayatri metre. Your head is..."
5.1.2.3	Having gone back by the same route by which he had gone, facing the south, he should bow to the right wing with the verse, "Salutations to thee, O Rathantara, thy right wing."
5.1.2.4	Having gone beyond the tail of the fire facing the east, he should bow down to the left wing with the verse "Salutations to thy left wing, O Brihat."
5.1.2.5	Facing the east, he bows down to the tail with the verse, “Salutations to thy tail, O Bhadra, thy support.
5.1.2.6	"To the right of the tail, one should bow to oneself, saying, 'Salutations to you, O king of the self, you who are the self.'
5.1.3.1	One should proceed to the assembly hall as it is.
5.1.3.2	In front, a stool should be placed.
5.1.3.3	Having washed the poles and ropes, having sprinkled them with water, having gone around the Agnidhra-shed from the north, having entered through the eastern door, one should place all the sacrificial posts in the north.
5.1.3.4	The wood of the Udumbara tree is used for the pegs, or Palasa wood mixed with it.
5.1.3.5	Three planks are fixed on both sides, or as many needles.
5.1.3.6	The peg is a span long, with its tip facing east, and its top facing north. The needles are fixed at the ends of the peg, with their tips facing east.
5.1.3.7	Having fixed the southern and northern pillars, he places the altar-shed in between, measuring the height of the mouth of the sacrificer.
5.1.3.8	The holes of the Kuṣṭha are made with two ropes. It rises upwards, to the right, to the left, and to the right. The two ropes should be three times the length of the Kuṣtha, and the Vīvaddha should be twice the length of the Vyāyāma. Having turned clockwise three times, he ties the knot upwards, which is called Niṣṭarka.
5.1.3.9	They spread it with branches or with grass, so that it is not shaken.
5.1.3.10	It should be four fingers wide, or as big as a fist.
5.1.3.11	It should point to the south, or be level.
5.1.3.12	The sacrificial post should be a foot high.
5.1.4.1	When the Prastara is fixed, the Hotṛ, having taken up the wooden arrow with a hundred strings, encloses it on both sides and places it towards the north, as one would place a vīṇā.
5.1.4.2	With seven metres, one more than four, he should take up the places above. Or with ten, he should take them up. "With the Gāyatrī metre, I take you up. With the Uṣṇīṣa metre, with the Anushtup metre, with the Bṛhat metre, with the Paṅkti metre, with the Tristubh metre, with the Jagatī metre, with the Vairāja metre, with the Dvipada metre, with the Atichandas metre, I take thee up."
5.1.4.3	Having recited the Chhandas, he moves around the places. With a wet branch of the Udumbara tree, with leaves, he thrice scratches the root with the formula, "For Prāṇa thee, for Apāna thee, for Vyāna thee, I scratch."
5.1.4.4	He should say, "I do not scratch again for other desires."
5.1.4.5	Then he gives it to the Chandogas with the branches.
5.1.4.6	He places the hands on the half-piece of wood with the formula, "For the vital airs follow the Prāṇa." He makes it move towards the east. With the formula, "Follow the Vyāna" he makes it move towards all directions. With the formula "Follow the Apāna" he makes (the boy) move towards himself.
5.1.4.7	He mutters the formula, "Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Svaḥ."
5.1.4.8	"For Prāṇa thee" (he says) while facing east; "For Vyāna thee" (he say) while facing south; "For Apāna thee" ( he says) while facing west.
5.1.4.9	"May the Vasus, having mounted thee with the Gāyatrī metre, mount thee" (he recites) while placing the axle-pin in the rear half of the plank.
5.1.4.10	Then he should grasp the eastern plank with both hands as if he were going to strike a cow.
5.1.4.11	He should touch the middle of the knee with the thumb or the joint of the two.
5.1.4.12	He crosses the right thigh, saying, "May Rudras ascend you with the Tristubh metre. I ascend them."
5.1.4.13	He crosses the left thigh, saying, “May the Adityas ascend you with the Jagatī metre. I ascend
5.1.4.14	The All-gods, having mounted on the metre Anushtubh, may they mount on thee. Thus he mounts on them.
5.1.4.15	He places the right foot of his own altar-site towards the east, then the left one. If one were to be tired, then the other. If the other, then the other again.
5.1.4.16	One should not make both feet too long.
5.1.4.17-18	The Hotrakas ascend the Kurchas, the Brahman the couch of Udumbara wood, and the Udgata
5.1.5.1	The Prastotar recites the first Prahara (verse) of the Pañcavimsa Stoma, in the three and a half, or in the three and half and fifteen verses remaining.
5.1.5.2	Jatukarna says that one should recite in the three and fifteen verses.
5.1.5.3	When it is said, "You are Suparna, the Garutman," then the speech that will be spoken, that will be spoken much, that will be uttered much, that will do much, that will accomplish much, that will go to heaven, that will speak in heaven, that will fall in heaven, that which will do in heaven, that shall accomplish in heaven, that heaven will say this sacrifice, that heaven will speak this sacrificer.

5.3.3.10	Where one studies this, one should not study anything else there. But where one studies something else, one may study this here.
5.3.3.11	A person does not become a graduate by not studying this. Even if he studies much else, he does not become a person who has studied this.
5.3.3.12	One should not neglect this, even if one neglects something else. One should not neglect this.
5.3.3.13	If one does not neglect this, one should know that one has done enough for oneself.
5.3.3.14	Let him know the truth.
5.3.3.15	He who knows this should not point out to one who does not know this, nor should he eat with him, nor should he be in the same place as him.
5.3.3.16	Now we shall explain the duties of self-study.
5.3.3.17	In the morning, when the sun has risen, in the evening, when the shadows have not yet disappeared, when the clouds have not yet risen, when it is not raining, for three nights, one should not speak of this story or recite it at night.
5.3.3.18	This is the name of the great being. He who knows this name becomes Brahman, becomes Brahman.

1.147.1	Now the naudhasa.
1.147.2	Nodhas, the son of Kakṣīvat, went about a long time finding no firm support. He desired: 'May I find a firm support'.
1.147.3-4	He came unto the Gods, who were dividing the sacred lore, and said: 'I am a seer, a maker of mantras; a long time I have gone about finding no firm support. Give ye to me that by which I may get a firm support'.
1.147.5	To him they gave the essence of sacred lore:
1.147.6	that became the naudhasa.
1.147.7	He used it in chanting and then he got a firm support.
1.154.18	Gods, Fathers and Men were on one side, Asuras, Ogres and Pisacas on the other side.
1.154.19	These contended about (the possession of) these worlds.
1.154.20	Now, the Kali-Gandharvas moved in the middle, not heeding either party.
1.154.21	The Gods, the Fathers and the Men oveṚcame the Asuras, Ogres and Pisacas,
1.154.22	and they divided these worlds among themselves. The Gods took as their share the world of the Gods, the Fathers the world of the Fathers, the Men the world of the Men.
1.154.23	Then arrived the Kali-Gandharvas and said, 'Grant us also subsequently a share in these worlds'.
1.154.24	'No', they said, 'ye, forsooth, have kept yourselves neutral, not
1.154.25	They answered: 'But in our mind we have attended on ye, so give us a share'.
1.155.1	'No' they said, the worlds are well-divided by us, we cannot mix them up again'.
1.155.2	They said: 'Then let that be ours what we ourselves see'.
1.155.3	They granted them these Kalindas (the land of Kalinda ?), saying: 'Among these practise ye austerities'.
1.155.4	Because they granted the Kalindās to the Kalis, thence the Kalindās have this name.
1.155.5-7	This Kali, the son of Vitadanya, saw this saman, he practised it in chanting and saw by means of it this avantaradeśam duryantam lokam;
1.155.8	this he conquered.
1.155.9	This saman is a world (or 'room') gaining one,
1.155.10	he who has practised it in chanting finds room,
1.155.11	but the status of a Gandharva he does not reach,
1.155.12	he gains only the world of the Gandharvas.
1.155.13	Because Kali, the son of Vitadanya, saw this saman, therefore it is (called) kāleya.
1.158.8	By means of the kakubh and the uṣṇih Indra, standing on two gāyatrīs (the metre of 24 syllables) (as his feet), hurled his thunderbolt on Vṛtra. These two (gāyatrīs) were not able to support him;
1.158.9-10	he added to them the fourfooted animals: cow, horse, goat and sheep, and those supported him.
1.158.11-12	Standing on the kakubh and uşņih, making the sabha and pauskala his two arms, he hurled (the thunderbolt) and slew him (viz. Vṛtra).
1.158.13	He who knows this slays his spiteful enemy.
1.159.1	He (Indra) stepped with one foot forward, the other one coming after;
1.159.2	the foot that was directed forward, became the kakubh;
1.159.3	therefore of the kakubh the greatest number of syllables is in the fore part;
1.159.4	the foot that came after, became the uṣṇih;
1.159.5	therefore of the uṣṇih the greatest number of syllables is in the hind part.
1.160.1	On these the sabha (is chanted), in order that the sacrifice may be sabha (possessed of bhā, ‘light'?).
1.160.2	All that is wrongly chanted or recited, or incomplete in the sacrifice, for clearing up (all) that (it is adhibited).
1.160.3	They chant this saman, hoping that it may be shining, illuminated (?).
1.160.5	By means of the sabha, the Gods (possessed themselves) of the splendour, the power, the valour, the strength, the cattle and the food of the Asuras, by means of the sabha, they made themselves lighting.
1.160.23	He (Prajāpati) did not know the domestic animals (the cows) from one another, as they were of one colour.
1.160.24-25	He saw the pauṣkala and, thereby, diṣṭinguished their colours:
1.160.26	they became of different colour: white, reddish, and black;
1.160.27	formerly, forsooth, they had been of one colour, red even they were.
1.165.14	The descendants of Śakti, being desirous of obtaining food, were consecrated.
1.165.15-16	Then Andhīgu, the Śāktya, saw this sāman and practised it in chanting;
1.165.17	he applied the decasyllabic virâj in the middle;
1.165.18	the virāj is decasyllabic,
1.165.19	the virāj is food;
1.165.20	thereupon they obtained the virāj, viz. the food.
1.178.1	They (the theologians) remark: 'The verses of the yajñāyajñīya are one syllable too short.
1.178.2	This is a gap in the yajñāyajñīya;
1.178.4	after the gap in the yajñāyajñīya the sacrifice leaks; after the sacrifice, the Sacrificer; after the Sacrificer, his children.
1.178.5	In this (gap) he should put the (the word) 'voice';
1.178.6	the voice, forsooth, is the sacred lore.
3.262.2-3	The Gods, undeṛtaking a sacrificial session, said: what of us is horrid, that we will produce, in order not to undeṛtake the sacrifice with (that) horrid (part).'
3.262.4	What was horrid of them that they produced, and cleansing it, put it down on (between) two earthen plates,
3.262.5	thereupon they undertook the sacrificial session.
3.262.6	Therefrom (from the two plates, the śarāvas) that akhala God was born.
3.262.7	Because he was born out of the plates, that is his name.
3.262.8	It was Agni that here was born. 
3.262.9	He who knows this, is not hurt by this (God).
3.262.10	He (Agni-Rudra) said to the Gods: 'For what have ye caused me to come into existence'?
3.262.11	'For carefully watching', they replied, 'thou shalt kill him who may transgress'.
3.262.12	Now, Prajāpati had set his mind on his own daughter, the Dawn.
3.263.1	This (arrow shot by Rudra) is (the constellation called) the three-knotted arrow'
3.263.4-5	After he (Prajāpati) was shot, his seed fell down and came down on the Himavat.
3.263.6	It became mānusa.
3.263.7	About this the Gods and the Seers, coming together, said: 'Let not this be spoiled'.
3.263.8	Because they had said 'let it not be spoiled', hence it was mādusam,
3.263.9	and mādusam is called manusam ('man').
3.263.11	They set it to flames on all sides by Agni,
3.263.12	the Maruts blew on it,
3.263.13	by means of the śrayantīya they strengthened it:
3.263.14	hence the name śrayantīya.
3.263.15	Thereupon cattle was created;
3.263.16	those (animals) that first came into existence are the red ones;
3.263.17	those that came into existence out of the (seed) when it was being heated, are the reddish brown ones;
3.263.18	those that came into existence out of the (seed) when it was heated, are the brown ones;
3.263.19	those that came into existence out of the (seed), when it was being burned, are the mules and the black (animals),
3.263.20	and therefore, this same fire burns the white as well as the black (animal);
3.263.21	out of the spaṛks were created the goats and the antelopes; out of the coals the Aṅgirases,
3.264.1	out of the ashes mixed with coals were created the three vaśas: the one dedicated to Mitra and Varuṇa, the one dedicated to Bṛhaspati and the one dedicated to the All-Gods;
3.264.2	out of the ashes the donkey was created;
3.264.3	therefore he is (in colour) the
3.264.4	therefore he lives being ridden.

3.1.1.1.1	They make the people of the gods rejoice.
3.1.1.1.2	They should make the one that is the best rejoice. Whatever is not on the ground, that should be made to rejoice.
3.1.1.1.3	From here the gods went up to heaven.
3.1.1.1.4	He who consecrates goes up to the gods.
3.1.1.1.5	He sacrifices to the people of the god while being with the gods.
3.1.1.1.6	If he were to lie down on anything other than the ground, he would be inferior and would be worse off.
3.1.1.1.7	Therefore, they should build it on the highest ground.
3.1.1.2.1	That would be the highest ground. It would be even.
3.1.1.2.2	Being even, it would not be sloping.
3.1.1.2.3	Being not sloping, it would slope towards the east.
3.1.1.2.4	The eastern direction is of the gods.
3.1.1.2.5	Or it would slope towards north.
3.1.1.2.6	The northern direction is of men.
3.1.1.2.7	It would be as if it were raised up towards the south.
3.1.1.2.8	This is the direction of the Pitrs.
3.1.1.2.9	If it were sloping towards the south, the sacrificer would soon go to this world.
3.1.1.2.10	Thus the sacrificer lives long.
3.1.1.2.11	Therefore it would be as if raised up towards the north.
3.1.1.3.1	The sacrificial post should not be higher than the altar by more than a man's height.
3.1.1.3.2	The sacrificer who has performed the Devyajanam rite, conquers his enemies.
3.1.1.3.3	One may perform the Devyajanaman rite on the right side or on the left side.
3.1.1.3.4	But the Devyajanman rite is indeed successful when only the Devyajanma rite remains at the end.
3.1.1.3.5	The Devyajanma rites on the northern side soon surpass it.
3.1.1.3.6	Thus is the Devyajanmam rite.
3.1.1.4.1	Then he said to Yajnavalkya, "I want to perform the Devyajanam sacrifice for the Varshniyas."
3.1.1.4.2	Satyayajna said, "The entire earth is indeed divine.
3.1.1.4.3	Wherever one performs the Devyajan sacrifice, one should perform it by first enclosing it with the Yajus."
3.1.1.5.1	The priests indeed perform the Devyajana sacrifice.
3.1.1.5.2	Those Brahmins who are learned, who recite, who know, who perform sacrifices, they say, "This is the best, we think."
3.1.1.6.1	They build a house or a wall with the main beam facing east.
3.1.1.6.2	For the east is the direction of the gods.
3.1.1.6.3	The gods turned their backs on men and faced east.
3.1.1.6.4	Therefore one offers standing facing them.
3.1.1.7.1	Therefore one should not sleep with one's head towards the west, lest one should sleep with one' s head towards the gods.
3.1.1.7.2	The southern direction is that of the Pitrs.
3.1.1.7.3	The western direction is that of serpents.
3.1.1.7.4	The direction from which the gods have gone is the one without them.
3.1.1.7.5	The northern direction is that of men.
3.1.1.7.6	Therefore men build houses with their northern ends pointing upwards or make their beds with their northern ends towards them.
3.1.1.7.7	The northern direction is for men.
3.1.1.7.8	The northern direction is for the initiated, not for the uninitiated.
3.1.1.8.1	They cover it, lest it should rain on it.
3.1.1.8.2	It does not rain on it. Indeed, it does not rain.
3.1.1.8.3	He who is initiated approaches the gods.
3.1.1.8.4	He becomes one with the gods.
3.1.1.8.5	The gods are indeed distant from men.
3.1.1.8.6	This is distant, namely, what is covered.
3.1.1.10.5	They are fit for sacrifice. Therefore, if he finds a conversation with a Śūdra, he should say to one of them, "This one."
3.1.1.10.6	"Examine this one."
3.1.1.10.7	This is the procedure for the initiated one there.
3.1.1.11.1	Then, taking the ladle in his hand, he enters the hall.
3.1.1.11.2	He approaches the king of the eastern quarter and recites this verse: "We have come to the place of worship of the gods on earth, where the gods enjoy themselves together."
3.1.1.11.3	This becomes pleasing to all the gods and to those Brahmanas who are attentive and recite.
3.1.1.11.4	What the Brahmanas see with their eyes, and what they hear, that becomes dear to them.
3.1.1.12.1	And what he says, "Where the gods have enjoyed, all of them," that becomes dear to all the gods.
3.1.1.12.2	"Crossing over by means of the Rks and Sama hymns,"
3.1.1.12.3	For by means of the Rs and Sama hymns one reaches the goal of the sacrifice.
3.1.1.12.4	"He goes to the goal of the sacrifice." So he says.
3.1.1.12.5	"May we be united with prosperity and wealth."
3.1.1.12.6	Prosperity is the earth.
3.1.1.12.7	Prosperity is glory.
3.1.1.12.8	He indeed prays for a blessing.
3.1.1.12.9	"May be united with wealth."
3.1.1.12.10	They say of one who attains prosperity, who attains the highest state, that he is united with wealth.
3.1.1.12.11	Therefore he says, "May we be united with the divine power."
3.1.2.1.1	One should initiate in the afternoon.
3.1.2.1.2	One should eat what one desires before shaving the hair and beard, or what one may accomplish.
3.1.2.1.3	For him, eating is a vow from this point on.
3.1.2.1.4	If one does not desire to eat, one may eat as one wishes.
3.1.2.2.1	Then they build a hut to the north.
3.1.2.2.2	He places that pot of water.
3.1.2.2.3	The barber attends to him.
3.1.2.2.4	He shaves his hair and beard and cuts his nails.
3.1.2.2.5	There is something unclean in a man where water does not attend to him.
3.1.2.2.6	Water does not attend to his hair, beard and nails.
3.1.2.2.7	When he shaves his hair and beard and cuts his nails, he becomes pure and is consecrated.
3.1.2.3.1	Some people shave their entire body and become pure, saying, "We shall be consecrated."
3.1.2.3.2	One should not do so.
3.1.2.3.3	When one shaves one's hair and beard and trims one's nails, one becomes pure.
3.1.2.5.2	The left one is in front among men, and the right one among the gods.
3.1.2.6.1	He anoints the cow with the right one first, saying, "May these goddesses, the waters, be auspicious to me."
3.1.2.6.2	When he says, "May these goddess waters be auspicious to me," the waters are the thunderbolt.
3.1.2.6.3	The waters are indeed the thunderbolt.
3.1.2.6.4	Therefore, they make a low-lying area when they flow there.
3.1.2.6.5	When they stand there, they burn.
3.1.2.6.6	He thus appeases this very thunderbolt.
3.1.2.6.7	Thus indeed this thunderbolt does not injure him.
3.1.2.6.8	Therefore he says, "May the waters be peaceful for me."
3.1.2.7.1	Then he places a fresh darbha grass, saying, "O herb, protect me."
3.1.2.7.2	The razor is indeed a thunderbolt.
3.1.2.7.3	Thus this thunderbolt does not harm him.
3.1.2.7.4	Then he anoints with a razor, saying, "May the razor not injure him."
3.1.2.7.5	The razor is indeed a thunderbolt.
3.1.2.7.6	Thus indeed this thunderbolt, the razor, does not injure him.
3.1.2.8.1	Having cut (the hair), he throws it into a vessel of water.
3.1.2.8.2	Silently he anoints the cow-gift with the second (part of the razor).
3.1.2.8.3	Silently he puts the young darbha grass inside.
3.1.2.8.4	He silently cuts off with a razor and throws it into the water.
3.1.2.9.1	Then he gives the razor to the barber.
3.1.2.9.2	He shaves his hair and beard.
3.1.2.9.3	When he shaves his hair,
3.1.2.10.1	then he bathes.
3.1.2.10.2	A man is impure,
3.1.2.10.3	because he speaks untruth, he becomes foul within.
3.1.2.10.4	Water is pure,
3.1.2.10.5	having become pure, one consecrates.
3.1.2.10.6	The water is sacred.
3.1.2.10.7	The initiation is purified by the sacred (water).
3.1.2.10.8	Therefore one bathes.
3.1.2.11.1	He bathes, saying, "May the waters, our mothers, purify us."
3.1.2.11.2	"May they purify us with ghee, for ghee."
3.1.2.11.3	That is indeed well purified with which one purifies with ghee.
3.1.2.11.4	Therefore he says, "May they purify us for ghee, for ghee."
3.1.2.11.5	The goddesses indeed carry the whole world, the impure.
3.1.2.11.6	What is the whole world, that is impure.
3.1.2.11.7	For they carry all that is impure from it.
3.1.2.11.8	Therefore it is said: "The goddesses indeed carry the impure whole world."
3.1.2.12.1	Then he steps forth towards the east, as it were towards the north, saying: "May I be pure and purified for them."
3.1.2.12.2	He comes forth pure and clean from them.
3.1.2.13.1	Then he puts on the garment, for the sake of all.
3.1.2.13.2	He puts on this skin of his own.
3.1.2.13.3	For this skin of the cow was indeed in the man.
3.1.2.14.1	The gods said, "The cow indeed supports all this.
3.1.2.14.2	Let us put on it the skin which is in the man.
3.1.2.14.3	By that she will endure the rain, by that the cold, by that the heat.
3.1.2.15.1	They put on the skin of the cow, which was the shade.
3.1.2.15.2	By that she endures the rain, by the cold, by the heat.
3.1.2.16.1	For the man is indeed covered.
3.1.2.16.2	Therefore wherever he may cut or wound himself, blood flows from that very place.
3.1.2.16.3	In him they placed this skin, as a garment.
3.1.2.16.4	Therefore no one wears a garment other than a man.
3.1.2.16.5	For they placed this skin in him.
3.1.2.16.6	Therefore one should desire to be well-dressed with one's own skin, as a sign of prosperity.
3.1.2.16.7	Therefore even the indecent desire to see one who is well-dressed.
3.1.2.16.8	He becomes rich with his own skin.
3.1.2.17.1	One should not be naked at the end of the cow.
3.1.2.17.2	The cow knows, "I am bearing his skin."
3.1.2.17.3	She is afraid, "He will take my skin."
3.1.2.17.4	Therefore, cows approach even a well-dressed person.
3.1.2.18.1	This is the garment of Agni, the covering of Vayu, the shawl of the Pitrs, the slayer of serpents, the threads of all the gods, the fastening of the stars.
3.1.2.18.2	For thus all the gods are connected with it.
3.1.2.18.3	Therefore it is the garment of the initiated.
3.1.2.19.1	It should be new, for the sake of not being exhausted.
3.1.2.19.2	He should say, "I have completed the consecration," for whatever impurity he has created or will create, that becomes pure.
3.1.2.19.3	If it is not new, he should sprinkle it with water, saying, "It becomes pure."
3.1.2.19.4	Or, if one has taken a bath and the water has been put down, one may consecrate oneself with that.
3.1.2.20.1	He puts it on, saying, "Thou art the body of consecration and penance."
3.1.2.20.2	For at first this is the body of one who is not consecrated, but now it is the body of consecration.
3.1.2.20.3	Therefore he says, "Thou art body of consecration and of penance."
3.1.2.20.4	"I put on thee the auspicious, the good."
3.1.2.20.5	He means to say, "I put on thee that which is auspicious, that which is good."
3.1.2.20.6	"He says, 'May he prosper with a good reputation.'
3.1.2.20.7	He who is not initiated, he prospers with a bad reputation.
3.1.2.20.8	Now here is the good one.
3.1.2.20.9	Therefore he says, 'May (he) prosper with a good (reputation).'
3.1.2.21.1	Then he introduces him to the hall.
3.1.2.21.2	He should not eat with a cow and a bull.
3.1.2.21.3	The cow and the bull support all this.
3.1.2.21.4	The gods said, "The cow and the bull bear all this."
3.1.2.21.5	"Let us put the strength of other animals into the cow and the bull."
3.1.2.21.6	They put the strength of the other animals into the bull and the cow.
3.1.2.21.7	Therefore the cow and the ox eat the most.
3.1.2.21.8	Now, he who eats the food of a cow and a bull is like one who eats everything. It is like the end of a journey.
3.1.2.21.9	He who killed his wife's embryo, which was conceived by a miracle, committed a sin. That is why he is called Pāpī Kirti.
3.1.2.21.10	Therefore, one should not eat the food of a bull and a cow.
3.1.2.21.11	He said, "I eat only if you have a shoulder."
3.1.3.1.1	Having offered water, he offers a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni-Vishnu.
3.1.3.1.2	Agni is all the deities.
3.1.3.1.3	For in Agni all the deities are offered.
3.1.3.1.4	Agni and Vishnu are the beginning and end of the sacrifice.
3.1.3.1.5	All the deities and the entire sacrifice are encompassed by this (rite). Thus is the consecration.
3.1.3.1.6	Therefore, there is an Ekadashâpala cake to Agni-Vishnu.
3.1.3.2.1	They offer a rice-pap to the Sun.
3.1.3.2.2	There is a statement that the eight sons of Aditi were born from her body and approached the gods. She went to the sun with seven.
3.1.3.3.1	Indeed, there are eight sons of Adita.
3.1.3.3.2	But those whom the gods call the Adityas are indeed only seven.
3.1.3.3.3	She gave birth to the eighth, the unchangeable Martanda.
3.1.3.3.4	The shadow is as long as the man himself.
3.1.3.3.5	Some say that it is the size of a man.
3.1.3.4.1	The gods said to the Adityas: "Whatever you have done to us, let it be so."
3.1.3.4.2	"Let us make him."
3.1.3.4.3	They made him as this man is made.
3.1.3.4.4	They joined together the flesh of him
3.1.3.4.5	Then there came to be an elephant.
3.1.3.4.6	Therefore they say, "One should not accept an elephant."
3.1.3.4.7	For an elephant is born from a man.
3.1.3.4.8	Indeed, that which they created was Vivasvan, the sun.
3.1.3.4.9	His are these creatures.
3.1.3.5.1	He said, "May he who offers this oblation to the sun be successful in his progeny."
3.1.3.5.2	He who offers this oblation to the Adityas, indeed, prospers.
3.1.3.5.3	This is the known one to Agni-Visnu.
3.1.3.6.1	It has seventeen kindling verses.
3.1.3.6.2	The deity is invoked in a low voice.
3.1.3.6.3	There are five fore-offerings and three after-offerings.
3.1.3.6.4	The wives are united for the sake of all.
3.1.3.6.5	He does not offer the Samitsti-yajus. He does not go to the end of the sacrificial session before wearing the consecrated garment.
3.1.3.6.6	For the Samitsti yajus is the end of the sacrifice.
3.1.3.7.1	Then standing in front of the hall, he anoints himself.
3.1.3.7.2	A man is indeed a wound.
3.1.3.7.3	He becomes unwounded when he anoints himself with oil.
3.1.3.7.4	The skin of a man is like that of a cow.
3.1.3.7.5	This is the ghee of the cow.
3.1.3.7.6	He makes it good with its own skin.
3.1.3.7.7	Therefore one anoints it.
3.1.3.8.1	This is the ghee.
3.1.3.8.2	Ghee is the food of the gods, and phāṇṭa is the food of men.
3.1.3.8.3	But this is neither ghee nor phāṇṭ.
3.1.3.8.4	It should be ghee and it should be phāṇṭ for the sake of non-exhaustion.
3.1.3.8.5	He makes it not too much nor too little.
3.1.3.9.1	He anoints it from the head downwards, in the direction of the feet, with the formula, "Thou art the milk of the earth."
3.1.3.9.2	"Mahy" is indeed the name of these (cows).
3.1.3.9.3	This is their milk.
3.1.3.9.4	Therefore he says, "Thou art milk of the earth".
3.1.3.9.5	"Thou art the giver of lustre, give me lustre."
3.1.3.9.6	There is nothing hidden here.
3.1.3.10.1	Then he anoints the eyes.
3.1.3.10.2	The eye is the eye of man.
3.1.3.10.3	Yajnavalkya said, "It is the eye that is the eye."
3.1.3.10.4	It is as if the eye is difficult to protect.
3.1.3.10.5	The eye itself is the eye's impurity.
3.1.3.10.6	He makes them non-eye by anointing the eyes.
3.1.3.11.1	Where the gods killed the Asuras and Rakshasas, the Dānava Shushna fell back and entered the eyes of men.
3.1.3.11.2	It shines like a young boy.
3.1.3.11.3	From that very place, they perform the sacrifice and build a wall of stone all around.
3.1.3.11.4	Because stone is used for eye-salve.
3.1.3.12.1	It is triangular.
3.1.3.12.2	Where Indra slew Vritra, where his eye was, that he made the Trikakud mountain.
3.1.3.12.3	In that it is Trikakud, he places the eye in the eye.
3.1.3.12.4	Therefore it is Trikakuda.
3.1.3.12.5	If one does not find a Trikakuda, it should be Ekakuda.
3.1.3.12.6	The eye-salve is indeed related to the eye.
3.1.3.13.1	One anoints with the arrow-grass.
3.1.3.13.2	The arrow-grass is indeed a thunderbolt, a protector against the Rakshas.
3.1.3.13.3	It has a thread.
3.1.3.13.4	This is indeed rootless, cut off on both sides, the Rakshas moves in the atmosphere.
3.1.3.13.5	Just as this man is rootless, cut-off on both sides, moves in the atmosphere,
3.1.3.13.6	so the Rakshas also. Therefore it has a thread. It is for protection against the Rakshasa.
3.1.3.14.1	He anoints the right one first.
3.1.3.14.2	The human (anointing) is done first on the left side, and then in the divine (manner).
3.1.3.15.1	He anoints (the right eye) with the formula, "Thou art the eye of Vritra, the pupil."
3.1.3.15.2	For this is the pupil of Vritra.
3.1.3.15.3	"Thou art the eye-giver, give me the eye."
3.1.3.15.4	There is nothing hidden here.
3.1.3.16.1	He anoints the right eye once with the formula and once silently.
3.1.3.16.2	Then he anoints it once with the Yajus, twice silently.
3.1.3.16.3	He thus makes it superior to the other.
3.1.3.17.1	When he anoints it five times, the sacrifice is equal to a year.
3.1.3.17.2	There are five seasons in a year.
3.1.3.17.3	He obtains it by means of five.
3.1.3.17.4	Therefore he anoints it by five.
3.1.3.18.1	Then he purifies it with the Darbha-purity.
3.1.3.18.2	The man is impure when he speaks untruth.
3.1.3.18.3	By that he becomes rotten within.
3.1.3.18.4	Darbha grass is pure.
3.1.3.18.5	Having become pure, one consecrates oneself.
3.1.3.18.6	Darbha is a purifier.
3.1.3.18.7	Having been purified by the purifier, one consecrates.
3.1.3.18.8	Therefore he purifies him with the purifier of darbha.
3.1.3.19.1	It should be only one.
3.1.3.19.2	For this one alone purifies.
3.1.3.19.3	It is in the form of this.
3.1.3.19.4	Therefore, there should be one.
3.1.3.20.1	Or, there should be three.
3.1.3.20.2	For this one indeed blows.
3.1.3.20.3	He, having entered the man, is divided into three: Prāṇa, Udāna, and Vyāna.
3.1.3.20.4	That is the measure of him alone.
3.1.3.20.5	Therefore, there should be thee.
3.1.3.21.1	Or, it should be seven.
3.1.3.21.2	For these seven are the vital airs in the head.
3.1.3.21.3	Therefore there should be seven.
3.1.3.21.4	There should be twenty-one, three times seven.
3.1.3.21.5	This is the very same prosperity.
3.1.3.22.1	He purifies him with seven, seven times, saying, "May Citpati purify me."
3.1.3.22.2	Citpati is indeed Prajapati.
3.1.3.22.3	He says this, "May Prajapati purify me."
3.1.3.22.4	"May Vakpati purify me."
3.1.3.22.5	Prajapati is the lord of speech.
3.1.3.22.6	He says this: "May Prajapati purify me."
3.1.3.22.7	"May the god Savitar purify me."
3.1.3.22.8	That which is well purified by the god Savitar.
3.1.3.22.9	Therefore he says, "May the god Savita purify me."
3.1.3.22.10	With the flawless purifier.
3.1.3.22.11	Or this is the Pavitra, which is without a break.
3.1.3.22.12	He says this with it.
3.1.3.22.13	"With the rays of the sun."
3.1.3.22.14	These are the purifiers, namely, the rays of the Sun.
3.1.3.22.15	Therefore he says, "With the rays of Sun."
3.1.3.23.1	"May it be the lord of the Pavitra for you."
3.1.3.23.2	For he becomes the lord of the pavitra.
3.1.3.23.3	"Of the purified by the pavitra."
3.1.3.23.4	For he is purified by the purifying (rites).
3.1.3.23.5	"He says, 'May I be able to do what I desire."
3.1.3.23.6	"He says this, 'May we go to the end of the sacrifice."
3.1.3.24.1	Then he recites the beginning of the blessings: "We pray to you, O gods, for the good, for the sake of the sacrifice. We invoke your blessings, O gods, which are fit for sacrifice."
3.1.3.24.2	Then his own priests bless him.
3.1.3.25.1-7	Then he offers the fingers, saying, "Svāhā to the sacrifice in the mind." Two verses. "Svāhā to heaven from the sky." Two verses. "Svāhā from heaven and earth." Two verses. Svāhā to the wind from the beginning." He makes a fist. The sacrifice does not begin as directly as this stick or garment. The gods are beyond sight. The sacrifice is beyond sight.
3.1.3.26.1	When he says, "Svāhā to the sacrifice in the mind," he begins with the mind.
3.1.3.26.2	"Svāhā to heaven from the sky," he begins from the sky.
3.1.3.26.3	"Svāhâ to heaven and earth," he begins with heaven and earth, on which everything here is based.
3.1.3.26.4	"Svâhā to the wind," he begins.
3.1.3.26.5	The wind is the sacrifice.
3.1.3.26.6	He begins with the sacrifice directly.
3.1.3.27.1	Then when he says 'svāhā svāhā',
3.1.3.27.2	the 'svāhā' is indeed the sacrifice.
3.1.3.27.3	He thus places the sacrifice within himself.
3.1.3.27.4	Here he restrains speech.
3.1.3.27.5	Speech is indeed the sacrifice,
3.1.3.27.6	he thus places the sacrifice in himself.
3.1.3.28.1	Then he leads him to the hall,
3.1.3.28.2	approaching the Āhavanīya from the rear and the Garhapatya from the front,
3.1.3.28.3	That is his course, up to the Sutyā (rite).
3.1.3.28.4	That he has this course, up to Sutyā,
3.1.3.28.5	Agni is the womb of the sacrifice, the consecrated one is the embryo.
3.1.3.28.6	The embryo moves between the womb and the embryo.
3.1.3.28.7	When he moves there, when he turns around, then these embryos move and turn around.
3.1.3.28.8	Therefore this is his course until the Soma-drinking.
3.1.4.1.1	All the Yajus formulas of initiation are Udgṛbhṇīya.
3.1.4.1.2	He who initiates himself approaches the world of gods from this world.
3.1.4.1.3	By means of these very Yajus formulas he approaches.
3.1.4.1.4	Therefore they say that all the formulas of initiation are Udgṛbhṇī.
3.1.4.1.5	Then they call these intermediate ones Udgṛbhṇa.
3.1.4.1.6	For these are oblations.
3.1.4.1.7	For the oblation is the sacrifice.
3.1.4.1.8	One recites the Yajus silently.
3.1.4.1.9	But this is the direct sacrifice, namely, the oblation.
3.1.4.1.10	By means of this sacrifice he wins for himself the world of the gods from this world.
3.1.4.2.1	The three offerings made with the ladle are called the offerings of the learned.
3.1.4.2.2	The fourth offering is made for the sake of prosperity.
3.1.4.2.3	The fifth offering made with the ladle is the actual Udgṛbhṇi.
3.1.4.2.4	For the Anushtubh is indeed the sacrifice.
3.1.4.2.5	The Anushtubh indeed is speech.
3.1.4.2.6	Speech is indeed the sacrifice,
3.1.4.3.1	For by means of the sacrifice the gods won this victory, which is theirs.
3.1.4.3.2	They said: How can this (victory) not be ascended by men?
3.1.4.3.3	They thought of the essence of the sacrifice, as bees would think of honey.
3.1.4.3.4	Having shaken the sacrificial post, they disappeared.
3.1.4.3.5	And because he performed the sacrifice with it, it is called Yūpa.
3.1.4.4.1	The sages heard about this.
3.1.4.4.2	They performed the sacrifice as it is performed today.
3.1.4.4.3	In this way, he performs the sacrifice when he offers these oblations.
3.1.4.5.1	He offers five of them.
3.1.4.5.2	The sacrifice is equal to a year.
3.1.4.5.3	There are five seasons in a year.
3.1.4.5.4	He attains it with five (offerings).
3.1.4.5.5	Therefore he offers five times.
3.1.4.6.1	Now, then, of the offering itself.
3.1.4.6.2	"To Agni, the bestower of wealth, Svāhā!"
3.1.4.6.3	"One who knows thus, 'I shall offer at the beginning,'
3.1.4.6.4	Whatever is here of the sacrifice, that he makes his own by collecting it."
3.1.4.7.1	"To Medha, to Manas, to Agni, svāhā."
3.1.4.7.2	"One goes to the sacrifice with Medha and Manas, one should sacrifice."
3.1.4.7.3	Whatever is here of the sacrifice, that he makes it complete in himself.
3.1.4.8.1	"To Diksā, to Tapas, to Agni, Svāhā."
3.1.4.8.2	This is indeed said.
3.1.4.8.3	It is not offered.
3.1.4.9.1	"To Sarasvatī, to Pūṣan, to Agni, 'Svāhā."
3.1.4.9.2	Sarasvati is speech.
3.1.4.9.3	Speech is the sacrifice.
3.1.4.9.4	Pusha is cattle.
3.1.4.9.5	Pusha means prosperity.
3.1.4.9.6	Cattle are prosperity.
3.1.4.9.7	Cattle indeed are the sacrifice.
3.1.4.9.8	Whatever is the sacrifice here, that he makes it his own by collecting it.
3.1.4.10.1	They say, "These oblations are offered without being placed, without being established, without being divine.
3.1.4.10.2	There is neither Indra, nor Soma, nor Agni.
3.1.4.11.1	To Agni, the instigator, svāhā.
3.1.4.11.2	There is not one of them.
3.1.4.11.3	Agni is indeed the instigator, Agni is the established one.
3.1.4.11.4	When he offers to Agni, it is by that very instigator and that established one.
3.1.4.11.5	Therefore one should offer to Agni in all (offerings) with svāhā. 
3.1.4.11.6	Then they are called those who have learned the Yajus.
3.1.4.12.1	"To Agni, to the instigator, to the instigated, svāhā."
3.1.4.12.2	"One instigates oneself, thinking, "I shall perform the sacrifice."
3.1.4.12.3	He instigates himself.
3.1.4.12.4	"What he creates, these two, instigation and instigated, become his deities in himself."
3.1.4.13.1	"To Agni of wisdom and mind, svāhā."
3.1.4.13.2	By means of wisdom and mind he approaches, saying, 'I shall sacrifice.'
3.1.4.13.3	These two deities, wisdom and mind, are deposited in him.
3.1.4.14.1	To Sarasvati, to Pusan, to Agni, to Svāhā.
3.1.4.14.2	Sarasvati is speech.
3.1.4.14.3	The sacrifice is speech.
3.1.4.14.4	This deity is deposited in him, speech.
3.1.4.14.5	Pusan is cattle.
3.1.4.14.6	Pusan means prosperity.
3.1.4.14.7	Prosperity is cattle.
3.1.4.14.8	The animals are the sacrifice.
3.1.4.14.9	These animals are deposited in him.
3.1.4.14.10	And because these deities are deposited in him, therefore they are called Adhītayajūṃṣi.
3.1.4.15.1	Then he offers the fourth oblation: "The divine waters, the great, the all-pervading, heaven and earth, the sky, for Brihaspati we offer oblation, svāhā."
3.1.4.15.2	This is the nearest to the sacrifice.
3.1.4.15.3	He praises the waters.
3.1.4.15.4	For the waters are the sacrifice.
3.1.4.15.5	"He says, "Heaven and earth are the breasts in the sky," praising the worlds."
3.1.4.15.6	"He says "Let us worship with oblations to Brihaspati, svāhā!"
3.1.4.15.7	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman.
3.1.4.15.8	The sacrifice is Brahman.
3.1.4.15.9	This is the nearest to this sacrifice.
3.1.4.16.1	Now the fifth ladle-full which he offers is indeed the sacrifice itself.
3.1.4.16.2	For he offers it with the Anushtubh verse.
3.1.4.16.3	The Anushtubh is speech.
3.1.4.16.4	Speech is the sacrifice.
3.1.4.17.1	Now when there is ghee left over in the Dhruva, he brings it to the Juhu.
3.1.4.17.2	Three times he takes ghee with the ladle for sprinkling and puts it on the Juhu.
3.1.4.17.3	He takes the third ladle and fills it with the Sruva.
3.1.4.18.1	He offers with the verse, "The whole world has followed the path of the divine leader. The whole world desires prosperity. Choose the splendour, you prosper, svāhā."
3.1.4.19.1	This is the sequence of the deities: "The verse beginning with "Viśvo devasyā". The verse beginning with ".
3.1.4.19.2	Bṛhaspati is the one who bestows splendor.
3.1.4.19.3	The verse beginning with "Puṣyasah" is dedicated to Pūṣan.
3.1.4.20.1	This is the sequence of deities.
3.1.4.20.2	The sacrifice is fivefold.
3.1.4.20.3	The animal is fivefold.
3.1.4.20.4	The five seasons are of the year.
3.1.4.20.5	He attains that (year) by means of this (offering) when the Paṅkti is offered to the deities.
3.1.4.21.1	He offers it with the Anushtubh verse.
3.1.4.21.2	Speech is Anushtubh.
3.1.4.21.3	Speech is the sacrifice.
3.1.4.21.4	He attains the sacrifice directly.
3.1.4.22.1	They say, one should offer this alone.
3.1.4.22.2	The one for whom the other oblations are offered, he obtains that desire by means of this (oblation).
3.1.4.22.3	If one were to offer only one oblation, one should offer a full oblation.
3.1.4.22.4	The full is everything.
3.1.4.22.5	One obtains everything by means of this.
3.1.4.22.6	When one fills the spoon, one fills the ladle.
3.1.4.22.7	One offers the full ladle.
3.1.4.22.8	This is indeed said.
3.1.4.22.9	All of them are offered.
3.1.4.23.1	She is offered with the Anushtubh (metre).
3.1.4.23.2	That Anushtubh has thirty-one syllables.
3.1.4.23.3	There are ten fingers in the hands, ten in the feet, ten breaths, and the self is the thirty-first, in which these breaths are established.
3.1.4.23.4	This is the extent of a man.
3.1.4.23.5	Man is sacrifice.
3.1.4.23.6	The sacrifice is equal to man.
3.1.4.23.7	Whatever is the extent of the sacrifice, whatever is its measure, by that much he attains it when he offers with the Anushtubh verse consisting of thirty-one syllables.
3.2.1.1.1	He spreads a black antelope skin on the ground to the south of the Ahavaniya fire, with its neck towards the east.
3.2.1.1.2	On them he consecrates him.
3.2.1.1.3	If there are two, then that is the form of these two worlds.
3.2.1.1.4	He consecrates him in the two worlds, connected with each other.
3.2.1.2.1	The two worlds are connected with each other,
3.2.1.2.2	as the two worlds are connected.
3.2.1.2.3	The two are at the end of the two worlds.
3.2.1.2.4	Having united these two worlds, he consecrates him in them.
3.2.1.3.1	If there is one, that is the form of these worlds.
3.2.1.3.2	He consecrates him in these worlds.
3.2.1.3.3	Those which are white are the form of heaven, those which are black are of this (earth).
3.2.1.3.4	Or else, those which are white are of heaven, those are of this (Earth).
3.2.1.3.5	Those which are tawny and reddish are the form of the atmosphere.
3.2.1.3.6	He consecrates him in these worlds.
3.2.1.4.1	Then he should place the Antaka (the last) behind.
3.2.1.4.2	Having united these worlds, he consecrates him in them.
3.2.1.5.1	Then he sits down on the black antelope skin with his back towards the east, with his knees towards the west, and facing north.
3.2.1.5.2	Where there is the junction of the white and black (halves of the moon), he recites thus, 'In the art of the Rks and Sāmans you are established.'
3.2.1.5.3	What is suitable is art.
3.2.1.5.4	He says this, 'You are established in the suitability of the Rks, and the Sāmans.'
3.2.1.6.1	'We begin with you.'
3.2.1.6.2	One who consecrates becomes a foetus.
3.2.1.6.3	He enters the metres.
3.2.1.6.4	Therefore, it is said, "May you be like the fingers of my hand."
3.2.1.6.5	For the foetus is like the fingers of the hand.
3.2.1.7.1	When he says, "I am approaching you," he means, "I am entering you."
3.2.1.7.2	"May you protect me from the beginning of the sacrifice," he means, "May you protect me till the end of the sacrifice."
3.2.1.8.1	Then he mounts with the right knee, saying, "Thou art a shelter; grant me shelter."
3.2.1.8.2	This is the skin of the black antelope; that is his human shelter, divine.
3.2.1.8.3	Therefore he says, "Thou art shelter; grant me protection."
3.2.1.8.4	"Let there be reverence to thee; do not injure me."
3.2.1.8.5	He mounts a superior place when he mounts the sacrifice.
3.2.1.8.6	For the sacrifice is the black antelope skin.
3.2.1.8.7	Therefore, he makes this offering to the sacrifice.
3.2.1.8.8	Thus indeed, this sacrifice does not harm him.
3.2.1.8.9	Therefore, he says, "Let there be salutations to you. Do not harm me."
3.2.1.9.1	He should sit in the rear half of the seat.
3.2.1.9.2	If one were to sit in the middle of the seat, then one who would take him from there would say, "He will fall or he will fall down." It would indeed be so.
3.2.1.9.3	Therefore one should sit with the lower half of the body like a stump.
3.2.1.10.1	Then he removes the girdle.
3.2.1.10.2	The Angirasas, while being initiated, found the strength of the sacrifice.
3.2.1.10.3	They did not find anything else to eat except the vow. They saw this strength, the completion, in the middle.
3.2.1.10.4	They placed the strength in themselves, the completion, and attained it. In the same way, he places this strength in himself, the completion, here.
3.2.1.10.5	He gives strength to himself, and attains completion by it.
3.2.1.11.1	It is indeed a sheep.
3.2.1.11.2	It is soft, and therefore it is a sheep.
3.2.1.11.3	Where Prajapati was born, having become an embryo, from this sacrifice, and its most tender covering was the sheep.
3.2.1.11.4	Therefore they are pure, and flow.
3.2.1.11.5	What was his embryo-covering, that is the garment of the consecrated.
3.2.1.11.6	The embryo is between the womb and the placenta.
3.2.1.11.7	Therefore this garment is between.
3.2.1.11.8	Just as Prajapati was born from this sacrifice as an embryo, so is he born from this sacrifice.
3.2.1.12.1	It is three-layered.
3.2.1.12.2	Food is three-layered,
3.2.1.12.3	because animals are food.
3.2.1.12.4	The father, the mother and what is born from them is the third.
3.2.1.12.5	Therefore it is three-layered
3.2.1.13.1	It is covered with a Muñja grass.
3.2.1.13.2	The arrow is the thunderbolt, for protection against enemies.
3.2.1.13.3	It is released from the mould.
3.2.1.13.4	If she were created as a rope, she would be like other ropes, human.
3.2.1.13.5	If she were created as an animal, she would be a deity of the fathers.
3.2.1.13.6	Therefore she is created as a stone.
3.2.1.14.1	They remove her, saying, "This is the energy of the Angirasas."
3.2.1.14.2	For the Angirasas saw this energy.
3.2.1.14.3	"Oṃ, may I have strength in the form of wool."
3.2.1.14.4	Here there is nothing hidden.
3.2.1.15.1	Then he unties the knot, saying, "You are the knot of Soma."
3.2.1.15.2	For the one who is not initiated, this knot is at the beginning, and then for the one who is initiated, it is of Soma.
3.2.1.15.3	Therefore he says, "You are Soma's knot."
3.2.1.16.1	Then he unknots it.
3.2.1.16.2	One who is initiated becomes a fetus.
3.2.1.16.3	The embryo is covered, as it were, by the caul.
3.2.1.16.4	Therefore, he sprinkles.
3.2.1.17.1	He sprinkles, saying, "You are the shelter of Vishnu, the shelter of the sacrificer."
3.2.1.17.2	Both Vishnu and the sacrificer are here in this (rite).
3.2.1.17.3	When he consecrates, he becomes Vishnu.
3.2.1.17.4	When he sacrifices, he becomes the sacrificer.
3.2.1.17.5	Therefore he says, "You are the protector of Vishnu, the protector of the sacrificer."
3.2.1.18.1	Then he ties the black-horned cow to the post.
3.2.1.18.2	The gods and the Asuras, both of whom were offspring of Prajapati, their father, approached the inheritance.
3.2.1.18.3	The gods approached the mind, the Asuras approached speech.
3.2.1.18.4	The gods then approached the sacrifice, the Asuras the speech.
3.2.1.18.5	The gods approached her, the Asuras approached her.
3.2.1.19.1	The gods said to the sacrifice, "This is a woman, this is speech.
3.2.1.19.2	Do you approach her."
3.2.1.19.3	"She will call you."
3.2.1.19.4	Or she herself saw, "This is indeed a woman, this speech.
3.2.1.19.5	Do I approach her."
3.2.1.19.6	She will call me."
3.2.1.19.7	She approached her.
3.2.1.19.8	She was jealous of him as if from afar.
3.2.1.19.9	Therefore a woman is jealous of her husband as if from afar, because of the words.
3.2.1.19.10	He said, "She was jealous of me as if from afar."
3.2.1.20.1	They said, "O revered one, please counsel her."
3.2.1.20.2	"She will certainly call you."
3.2.1.20.3	He counseled her.
3.2.1.20.4	She spoke to him as if from a distance.
3.2.1.20.5	Therefore a woman, when addressed by a man, speaks like a reed.
3.2.1.20.6	He said, "You spoke to me like a reed."
3.2.1.21.1	They said, "O revered one, please address her."
3.2.1.21.2	"She will surely call you."
3.2.1.21.3	He addressed her.
3.2.1.21.4	She called him.
3.2.1.21.5	Therefore a woman calls a man only when he is the best.
3.2.1.21.6	He said, "Call me."
3.2.1.22.1	The gods then deliberated, "This woman is indeed speech, since she did not unite with him."
3.2.1.22.2	"Come to me while I am standing here," he said.
3.2.1.22.3	"But if she does not come, then speak to her."
3.2.1.22.4	She indeed came to him while he was standing there.
3.2.1.22.5	Therefore a woman approaches a man who is standing in a refined manner.
3.2.1.22.6	When she came to them, he said, "She has come."
3.2.1.23.1	The gods protected her from the Asuras.
3.2.1.23.2	Having taken her, they surrounded her in the fire and offered her as the entire oblation.
3.2.1.23.3	For the oblation is of the gods.
3.2.1.23.4	Whatever oblation they offered to her in the Anushtubh metre, the gods made her their own.
3.2.1.23.5	They, the Asuras, having their words taken away, cried out, "O Halavah! O Halavah!" and were defeated.
3.2.1.24.1	There they uttered this speech also, which is to be known:
3.2.1.24.2	He is a barbarian.
3.2.1.24.3	Therefore, a Brahmin should not speak like a barbarian.
3.2.1.24.4	This is indeed the Asurian speech.
3.2.1.24.5	This (speech) takes away the speech of enemies and rivals.
3.2.1.24.6	Those who know this, their words prevail.
3.2.1.25.1	This sacrifice approached speech, saying, "Let us be united."
3.2.1.25.2	It united with her.
3.2.1.26.1	Indra saw that something great would be born from here, from the union of sacrifice and speech.
3.2.1.26.2	"Let it not overcome me," he thought.
3.2.1.26.3	He, becoming the embryo of Indra, entered this pair.
3.2.1.27.1	When he was born in a year, he looked and said: "This is a great powerful womb which has conceived me."
3.2.1.27.2	"If I had not been born, it would have been a great misfortune."
3.2.1.27.3	"If it had not been me, it would not have been able to overcome me."
3.2.1.28.1	Having touched and encircled it, he cut it off.
3.2.1.28.2	He placed it on the head of the sacrifice.
3.2.1.28.3	The sacrifice is Krishna.
3.2.1.28.4	That which is the sacrifice, that is the black antelope skin.
3.2.1.28.5	That which was the womb, that is the Krishna-horn.
3.2.1.28.6	And when Indra bound and cut it, therefore it is as if bound.
3.2.1.28.7	Just as Indra was born from this womb, having become a foetus, from this union, so is he born from this womb.
3.2.1.29.1	He binds it as if it were lying down.
3.2.1.29.2	The womb indeed carries the foetus as if it were (lying) down.
3.2.1.31.3	If one scratches the embryo with a stick or a nail, it may die.
3.2.1.31.4	Then the embryo becomes a foetus.
3.2.1.31.5	Or the embryo becomes semen.
3.2.1.31.6	Then the semen becomes a foetus,
3.2.1.31.7	because the embryo does not injure its own womb.
3.2.1.31.8	This is indeed its own womb, namely the black-horned one.
3.2.1.31.9	Thus it does not injure it.
3.2.1.31.10	Therefore, the initiated one should scratch himself only with the black horn, not with any other horn.
3.2.1.32.1	Then he gives him a staff.
3.2.1.32.2	The staff is indeed a thunderbolt, for protection.
3.2.1.33.1	It is made of Udumbara wood.
3.2.1.33.2	Udumbara is food and energy; for the securing of food and energy.
3.2.1.33.3	Therefore, it is made of Udumvara wood.
3.2.1.34.1	It is the size of the mouth.
3.2.1.34.2	This is the extent of the power.
3.2.1.34.3	It becomes as much as the power, as much as the mouth-sized (bricks).
3.2.1.35.1	He places it (on the altar) with the verse, "O tree, grow up; protect me from above; be at the place of the sacrifice."
3.2.1.35.2	He says, "Protect me from above; at the place of sacrifice."
3.2.1.36.1	Here some people put their fingers together and restrain their speech, saying that from this point onwards one does not speak.
3.2.1.36.2	One should not do so.
3.2.1.36.3	Just as one who is running away from a danger cannot catch up with him, so one who does not catch up with the sacrifice.
3.2.1.36.4	Therefore one should put the fingers together here and restrain the speech here.
3.2.1.37.1	Now when the initiated one utters a verse, a formula, or a chant, he thereby begins the sacrifice again and again.
3.2.1.37.2	Therefore one should place the fingers here only, and restrain speech here only.
3.2.1.38.1	And when he restrains speech, speech is indeed the sacrifice; he thus places the sacrifice within himself.
3.2.1.38.2	Now when the sacrificer speaks, then this sacrifice, being released, turns away.
3.2.1.38.3	There he should recite a Vedic verse or a Yajus addressed to Vishnu.
3.2.1.38.4	Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
3.2.1.38.5	He thus resumes the sacrifice.
3.2.1.38.6	This is indeed his atonement.
3.2.1.39.1	Then if one says, "This is a consecrated Brahman,"
3.2.1.39.2	He tells him that he is present, and that he is the one who has come to the sacrifice, the one of great prowess.
3.2.1.39.3	He was one of yours.
3.2.1.39.4	He is saying, 'Protect him.'
3.2.1.39.5	He says it three times.
3.2.1.39.6	The sacrifice is threefold.
3.2.1.40.1	And when he says, 'Brahman,' then he is not bound, and he knows it beforehand.
3.2.1.40.2	For it is said, "The demons follow after a woman."
3.2.1.40.3	"The demons indeed place the semen in her."
3.2.1.40.4	Now here it is said, he who is born from Brahma, he who is from the sacrifice,
3.2.1.40.5	Therefore one should say, "He is a Brahmin," whether he is a king or a Vaishya.
3.2.1.40.6	For he who is born of Brahma, he who from the sacrifice,
3.2.1.40.7	Therefore they say, one should not kill one who has performed the Savana.
3.2.1.40.8	One who has performed the savana is indeed a lord.
3.2.2.1.1	He restrains speech.
3.2.2.1.2	He restraine speech and remains till sunset.
3.2.2.1.3	When he restrains speech,
3.2.2.2.1	The gods won this victory by means of the sacrifice, which is theirs.
3.2.2.2.2	They said, How can this not be ascended by men?
3.2.2.2.3	Having drunk the essence of the sacrifice, they would have been like honey-bees drinking honey.
3.2.2.2.4	Having drunk the sacrifice with the sacrificial post, they disappeared.
3.2.2.2.5	And because they drank with it, it is called yūpa.
3.2.2.3.1	That was heard by the sages.
3.2.2.3.2	They brought together the sacrifice.
3.2.2.4.7	He spent the night.
3.2.2.4.8	He releases speech after having attained as much as the sacrifice is and as much as its measure is.
3.2.2.5.1	Some, seeing a star, release speech, saying that it is the time for the performance after sunset.
3.2.2.5.2	One should not do so.
3.2.2.5.3	Where would they be if there were a cloud?
3.2.2.5.4	Therefore, one should release speech only at the place where one thinks it has been performed.
3.2.2.6.1	Some people release speech with this formula: "Bhūr Bhuvah Svaḥ," saying, "We are nourishing the sacrifice, we are uniting the sacrifice."
3.2.2.6.2	One should not do it in that way.
3.2.2.6.3	He who releases speech with this formula does not nourish the sacrifice or unite it.
3.2.2.7.1	With this very (verse) he should dismiss the speech. "Do the vow, do the vow. Agni is Brahman, Agni is sacrifice, Agni is the lord of plants, Agni is the sacrificer."
3.2.2.7.2	For this indeed is his sacrifice here, this is his oblation, as before the Agnihotra.
3.2.2.7.3	By means of this sacrifice he establishes the sacrifice in the sacrifice, he makes the sacrifice continuous with the sacrifice.
3.2.2.7.4	For this is his vow, indeed, till the Soma-pressing.
3.2.2.7.5	He says it thrice.
3.2.2.7.6	The sacrifice is threefold.
3.2.2.8.1	Then, having turned towards the fire, he releases speech.
3.2.2.8.2	He does not nourish the sacrifice and does not unite it, who releases speech in any other way.
3.2.2.8.3	He speaks the first truth, saying,
3.2.2.9.1	Agni is Brahman.
3.2.2.9.2	For Agni indeed is Brahman.
3.2.2.9.3	Agni is the sacrifice.
3.2.2.9.4	For Agni is indeed the sacrifice.
3.2.2.9.5	The tree is fit for sacrifice.
3.2.2.9.6	For trees are fit for sacrifice. For if there were no trees,
3.2.2.9.7	men would not be able to sacrifice.
3.2.2.9.8	Therefore he says, "The tree is fit to sacrifice."
3.2.2.10.1	Then they cook the vow for him.
3.2.2.10.2	He who is initiated approaches the gods.
3.2.2.10.3	He becomes one with the gods.
3.2.2.10.4	The gods' oblation is cooked, not uncooked.
3.2.2.10.5	Therefore they cook it.
3.2.2.10.6	He himself cooks the vow.
3.2.2.10.7	He does not offer it in the fire.
3.2.2.10.8	In that he himself cooks the vow and does not offer it into the fire,
3.2.2.11.1	The gods, by means of sacrifice, won this victory, which is theirs.
3.2.2.11.2	They said, "How can this (victory) not be ascended by men?"
3.2.2.11.3	Having thought about the essence of the sacrifice, as bees would take honey from a hive,
3.2.2.11.4	having milked the sacrifice with the sacrificial post, they disappeared.
3.2.2.11.5	Now, because he approached it with this (sacrificial post), therefore it is called yūpa.
3.2.2.12.1	The sages heard this.
3.2.2.12.2	They performed the sacrifice.
3.2.2.12.3	As this sacrifice was performed, so this sacrifice is performed here, for he who consecrates himself.
3.2.2.12.4	For this (sacrifice) creates him, this (sacrifice) generates him.
3.2.2.12.5	Whatever of the sacrifice is spilled or spilled over, that he again makes to swell by this very rite.
3.2.2.12.6	He does not offer into the fire.
3.2.2.12.7	If he were to offer into the fire, it would not swell.
3.2.2.12.8	He would think that he is offering, not that he is not offering.
3.2.2.13.1	These indeed are the vital airs, born of mind, yoked to mind, of the nature of Dakṣa.
3.2.2.13.2	Speech indeed is Agni.
3.2.2.13.3	Prāṇa and Udāna are Mitra and Varuna.
3.2.2.13.4	The eye is the sun.
3.2.2.13.5	The ear is the All-gods.
3.2.2.13.6	It is indeed in these deities that his offering is made.
3.2.2.14.1	Some, at the first vow, sow both rice and barley, saying, "We are replenishing what has been spilled and what has been spilled from the sacrifice with both juices."
3.2.2.14.2	If the Vrata-milk is not milked, one should perform the Vrata for the one for whom he desires.
3.2.2.14.3	For this is the way that both the barley and the rice are connected to him.
3.2.2.14.4	One should not do it like that.
3.2.2.14.5	For he does not nourish the sacrifice, does not join it, who sows both barley and rice.
3.2.2.14.6	Therefore one should sow only one of them.
3.2.2.14.7	These two, barley and rice, are his offerings.
3.2.2.14.8	These two are his offerings, and they are also his two (sacrifices).
3.2.2.14.9	If the Vrata-cow does not yield milk, one should perform the Vrata for him for whom he desires.
3.2.2.15.1	Now some, at the first rite, pour out all herbs and all fragrant substances. If the initiated one should meet with misfortune, he should be treated with whatever he desires. He should be treated according to the rite.
3.2.2.15.2	One should not do it like that.
3.2.2.15.3	They perform a human rite in the sacrifice.
3.2.2.15.4	What is human is contrary to the sacrifice.
3.2.2.15.5	"One should not perform what is contrary to the rite in the sacrifice."
3.2.2.15.6	If the initiated person meets with misfortune, he should be treated with whatever he desires.
3.2.2.15.7	The completion of the vow is indeed auspicious.
3.2.2.16.1	Then he gives him the vow, having passed the human time, milk in the evening, milk in the morning, and milk in the afternoon, having announced it.
3.2.2.16.2	He announces both the divine and the human.
3.2.2.17.1	Then, when about to give him the vow, he sprinkles him with water: "We have conceived the divine thought, the gentle, for the sake of blessing, the thought that bestows radiance, the thought that carries the sacrifice, the thought that leads us to the good ford."
3.2.2.17.2	This is the human thought, which is given to the one who eats before the dawn. Then there is the divine thought.
3.2.2.17.3	Therefore he says, "We invoke the divine mind, the gentle, for our prosperity, the one who bestows radiance, the one who is born from the sacrifice, the one who has good paths, may it be in our power."
3.2.2.17.4	One who is going to perform a vow should touch water before performing the vow. One should touch water with this very (verse).
3.2.2.18.1	Then he consecrates the vow, saying, "May those gods who are born of mind, who are united with mind, who have the power of Daksha, protect us. May they protect us. To them svāhā."
3.2.2.18.2	Just as an offering made with the Vasat-utterance is offered, so does this become for him.
3.2.2.19.1	Then having performed the vow, he touches the navel with the verse, "May you, the waters, be purified, within our belly, may you be auspicious. May the goddesses, the immortal ones, the increasers of truth, be agreeable to us, free from consumption, free from disease, free from injury."
3.2.2.19.2	He who initiates himself approaches the gods.
3.2.2.19.3	He becomes one with the deities.
3.2.2.19.4	The oblation of the gods is not to be offered with haste.
3.2.2.19.5	If one who has undertaken a vow commits a mistake,
3.2.2.19.6	he hastens the vow and transgresses it.
3.2.2.19.7	This is the atonement for that.
3.2.2.19.8	Thus it does not become a mistake,
3.2.2.19.9	and he does not transgress the vow.
3.2.2.19.10	Therefore he says, "Be ye the white and yellow waters, ye are within our belly, ye are well-behaved. May the goddesses, the immortal ones, who increase with truth, be agreeable to us, without consumption, without disease, without sickness."
3.2.2.19.11	One should touch the navel with whatever vow one has undertaken.
3.2.2.19.12	Who knows that? The one who gives the vow should not pour it out.
3.2.2.20.1	Then when he is about to look, he should strike a lump of earth with a black-horned stick, saying, "This is your sacrificial body."
3.2.2.20.2	This earth is the divine, sacrificial goddess.
3.2.2.20.3	She should not be touched by one who is consecrated.
3.2.2.20.4	Having taken hold of her, he releases the water, saying, "I release the body that is fit for sacrifice, and the body that is not fit for sacrifice, but not the offspring."
3.2.2.20.5	Both water and semen come from here.
3.2.2.20.6	He releases only the water, not the offspring.
3.2.2.20.7	"Released from sin, svāhā!"
3.2.2.20.8	For they are released from sin, as it were, when what is eaten is digested in the belly.
3.2.2.20.9	Therefore, he says, "I am free from sin."
3.2.2.20.10	"He enters the earth made with Svāhā."
3.2.2.20.11	Having become oblations, they enter the earth peacefully. This is what he says.
3.2.2.21.1	Then he places another lump of earth, saying, "For the origin of the earth."
3.2.2.21.2	This earth is indeed the divine sacrificial ground.
3.2.2.21.3	It should not be violated by one who is consecrated.
3.2.2.21.4	Having taken hold of that, he then looked upon the body fit for sacrifice and the body unfit for sacrifice.
3.2.2.21.5	He thus again establishes her in the body fit for the sacrifice.
3.2.2.21.6	Therefore he says, "From the earth may I arise."
3.2.2.22.1	Then he sleeps after giving the Agni to the attendants.
3.2.2.22.2	One who initiates himself approaches the gods.
3.2.2.22.3	He becomes one with the deities.
3.2.2.22.4	The gods do not sleep.
3.2.2.22.5	Or else his sleep is not obstructed.
3.2.2.22.6	Agni is the overlord of the vows of the gods.
3.2.2.22.7	He sleeps having given it to him alone, saying, "O Agni, you do wake up, we do sleep well."
3.2.2.22.8	He says this, "O Agni you do wake up; we shall sleep."
3.2.2.22.9	"Do not abandon us while sleeping."
3.2.2.22.10	"Protect us, O watchful one!" is what he says.
3.2.2.22.11	"Awaken us again!"
3.2.2.22.12	"Just as we may awaken safely after having slept here, so do this for us!" is what he means to say.
3.2.2.23.1	Then he recites that verse, "May my mind return, may my life return, may my breath return, may my self return, may my sight return, may my hearing return."
3.2.2.23.2	For all these depart from one who is asleep, but the breath does not.
3.2.2.23.3	Having slept with them, he again unites with them.
3.2.2.23.4	Therefore he says again, "May the mind come back to me again, may life come back to me, may the breath come back to me. May the self come back to me." "May the eye come back to me; may the ear come back to me." The unassailable Vaishvānara Agni, the body-embracing one, may he protect us from evil, from sin.
3.2.2.23.5	"Whatever wrong he does in his sleep or by any other means, from all that may Agni protect us." This is what he says.
3.2.2.23.6	"Therefore he says, 'Vaisvânara, the unassailable, the body-protecting Agni, may protect us from evil and sin.'
3.2.2.24.1	"And whatever a consecrated person says that is not in accordance with the vow, or becomes angry, that is wrong.
3.2.2.24.2	The vow is broken.
3.2.2.24.3	The vow of one who is initiated is not to be angry.
3.2.2.24.4	Agni is the lord of vows among the gods.
3.2.2.24.5	He approaches him, saying, "You, O Agni, are the lord of vows, a god among mortals. You are invited to the sacrifices."
3.2.2.24.6	This is indeed the atonement for that.
3.2.2.24.7	Thus his act does not become false.
3.2.2.24.8	He does not transgress the vow.
3.2.2.24.9	Therefore he says, "You are the guardian of vows, O Agni, among the gods and men. You are to be worshipped at sacrifices."
3.2.2.25.1	When they bring (Soma) to the initiated one, he recites on it, "May Soma give us more."
3.2.2.25.2	Soma indeed gives him what he desires when they bring (Soma to him) while he is initiated.
3.2.2.25.3	When he says, "Pour out this much Soma," he means, "Pour out more than this much Soma."
3.2.2.25.4	"May it be poured out again," he means, "May it be poured again for us."
3.2.2.25.5	"The god Savitar, the giver of wealth, has given wealth."
3.2.2.25.6	Thus indeed, this (gift) of his becomes impelled by Savitar.
3.2.2.26.1	Before sunset, he says, "O initiated one, restrain speech."
3.2.2.26.2	He releases speech when the sun has set.
3.2.2.26.3	Before sunrise, he says, “O initiated one, control speech.”
3.2.2.26.4	He releases speech at sunrise, continuously.
3.2.2.26.5	He connects the day with the night, the day with the day.
3.2.2.27.1	One should not let him wander elsewhere before sunset.
3.2.2.27.2	He should not rise up before him when he is asleep.
3.2.2.27.3	If he rises up before him when the latter is moving about, then he would be obstructing him during the night.
3.2.2.27.4	If he were to rise up before him while he is asleep, then he would obstruct him during the day.
3.2.2.27.5	There is no expiation in this case.
3.2.2.27.6	It is only to be kept secret from him.
3.2.2.27.7	One should not go beyond the place where water is sprinkled before sunrise; it should not rain on him.
3.2.2.27.8	That which is not determined, that which would have been before the rain, that which would rain on it.
3.2.2.27.9	Then he speaks words of praise, not human, free.
3.2.2.27.10	That which he speaks words of praises, not human, freed.
3.2.2.28.1	The gods won this victory by means of the sacrifice, this victory of theirs.
3.2.2.28.2	They said, "How can this not be climbed by men?"
3.2.2.28.3	They, having thought about the essence of the sacrifice, as bees would extract honey,
3.2.2.28.4	having milked the sacrifice with the sacrificial post, they disappeared.
3.2.2.28.5	And because they milked it with this, therefore it is called yūpa.
3.2.2.29.1	This was heard by the sages.
3.2.2.29.2	They performed the sacrifice.
3.2.2.29.3	Just as this sacrifice was performed, so also he who initiates himself performs the sacrifice.
3.2.2.29.4	Speech is indeed the sacrifice.
3.2.2.29.5	Whatever of the sacrifice has been spilled or poured out here, that he again nourishes when he speaks the sacrificial formula and not the human speech that is scattered.
3.2.2.29.6	He should not let his voice go beyond the limits of human speech.
3.2.2.29.7	Therefore, he speaks with a restrained voice, not beyond the limits of normal human speech.
3.2.2.30.1	He indeed consecrates himself.
3.2.2.30.2	He consecrates himself for speech.
3.2.2.30.3	He consecbrates himself for the sacrifice.
3.2.2.30.4	For the sacrifice is speech.
3.2.2.30.5	The name 'initiated' (dīkṣita) means 'consecrated' (dhikṣita).
3.2.3.1.1	He offers a rice-cake to Aditya as the preparatory oblation.
3.2.3.1.2	The gods, while performing the sacrifice on her, were separated from the sacrifice.
3.2.3.1.3	She, indeed, deluded them, saying: "How did they, while performing the sacrifiice on me, separate me from the sacrifice?"
3.2.3.1.4	They did not know that sacrifice.
3.2.3.2.1	They said, "How is it that we have forgotten the sacrifice in this very (earth)? How did we forget? How do we not know?"
3.2.3.3.1	They said, "We were performing the sacrifice in this (earth) when we went away from this sacrifice."
3.2.3.3.2	This (earth) alone did not forget the sacrifice.
3.2.3.3.3	We shall approach this (earth) alone."
3.2.3.4.1	They said, "If we have to perform the sacrifice in you, how did you not forget us? How did we not know?"
3.2.3.5.1	She said, "Performing the sacrifice in me, I went away from the sacrifice.
3.2.3.5.2	I am the one who made you forget the sacrifice.
3.2.3.5.3	Please allocate a share for me.
3.2.3.5.4	Then you will see the sacrifice.
3.2.3.5.5	Then they said, "Let us know."
3.2.3.6.1	The gods said, "So be it."
3.2.3.6.2	Yours is the Pravargya.
3.2.3.6.3	Yours is the Udayaniya."
3.2.3.6.4	Therefore this Aditya alone is the Pravargaya, and Aditya is the Udayanlya.
3.2.3.6.5	For this indeed is Aditi.
3.2.3.6.6	Then they saw the sacrifice.
3.2.3.6.7	They spread it out.
3.2.3.7.1	When he offers the oblation to Aditya as the preliminary rite, it is for the sake of seeing the sacrifice.
3.2.3.7.2	"Having seen the sacrifice, I shall buy it and make it mine."
3.2.3.7.3	Therefore he offers the oblations to Aditya as the prelimnary rite.
3.2.3.7.4	That oblation was indeed offered.
3.2.3.7.5	The deities were not pleased.
3.2.3.8.1	Then Svashti of the Pathas proclaimed it.
3.2.3.8.2	They worshipped it.
3.2.3.8.3	Speech is the path, prosperity.
3.2.3.8.4	Speech is the sacrifice.
3.2.3.8.5	They saw that sacrifice.
3.2.3.8.6	They spread it out.
3.2.3.9.1	Then Agni appeared to them.
3.2.3.9.2	They sacrificed to him.
3.2.3.9.3	What was the Agni part of the sacrifice, they saw.
3.2.3.9.4	What is the dry part of the sacrifice is the Agni part.
3.2.3.9.5	They saw it.
3.2.3.9.6	They spread that out.
3.2.3.10.1	Then Soma announced himself to them.
3.2.3.10.2	They worshipped him.
3.2.3.10.3	They saw what was Soma in the sacrifice.
3.2.3.10.4	What is moist in the sacrifice, that is Soma.
3.2.3.10.5	They saw it.
3.2.3.10.6	They spread it.
3.2.3.11.1	Then Savitr announced himself to them
3.2.3.11.2	They worshipped him
3.2.3.11.3	Savitr is indeed cattle.
3.2.3.11.4	Cattle is the sacrifice.
3.2.3.11.5	They saw that sacrifice and performed it.
3.2.3.11.6	Then they offered oblations to the deity to whom it was offered.
3.2.3.12.1	These are the five deities to whom he offers.
3.2.3.12.2	That sacrifice which was performed was fivefold.
3.2.3.12.3	They recognized it through these five deities.
3.2.3.13.1	The seasons were performed as five.
3.2.3.13.2	He knew them through these five deities.
3.2.3.14.1	The directions were confused.
3.2.3.14.2	He knew them through these same five deities.
3.2.3.15.1	He knew the northern direction through the path and the auspicious.
3.2.3.15.2	Therefore, here in the north, speech speaks, in Kuru and Pancala.
3.2.3.15.3	This is the origin of speech.
3.2.3.15.4	They knew the northern direction by means of this.
3.2.3.15.5	The northern direction is indeed hers.
3.2.3.16.1	They knew the eastern direction by means of Agni.
3.2.3.16.2	Therefore, having taken Agni to the rear and facing east, they worship him.
3.2.3.16.3	They knew this eastern direction by means.
3.2.3.16.4	The eastern direction is indeed his.
3.2.3.17.1	They knew the southern direction with Soma.
3.2.3.17.2	Therefore, when Soma is bought, they carry it around to the south.
3.2.3.17.3	Therefore, they say, "Soma belongs to the Pitrs."
3.2.3.17.4	For they knew the southern direction through him.
3.2.3.17.5	For the southern direction is his.
3.2.3.18.1	They knew the western direction with Savitr.
3.2.3.18.2	This indeed is Savitr, he who shines.
3.2.3.18.3	Therefore he goes towards the west.
3.2.3.18.4	For they knew the western direction by means of this.
3.2.3.18.5	For this is his western direction.
3.2.3.19.1	They knew the upward direction by means of Aditi.
3.2.3.19.2	Aditi is this (earth).
3.2.3.19.3	Therefore the plants grow upwards on this (earth), the trees grow upwards.
3.2.3.21.1	They say, what is done at the Prāyaniya (Sraddha) should be done at the Udayaniya (Sraddha).
3.2.3.21.2	What is the sacrificial grass at the Prāyanīya, that is the sacrificial grass of the Udayaniya.
3.2.3.21.3	Having taken it out, he places it.
3.2.3.21.4	Having wiped the pot with the ladle, he places the ladle.
3.2.3.21.5	The priests who officiate at the Pravargya ceremony officiate at the Udayaniya ceremony.
3.2.3.21.6	In that this is done in the same way in the sacrifice, therefore the arms are similar, therefore they are of the same form.
3.2.3.22.1	One should not do it in that way.
3.2.3.22.2	One should strew the sacrificial grass as one wishes, and should place the pot after having cleaned the ladle.
3.2.3.22.3	The priests who officiate at the Pravargya ceremony officiate at the Udayaniya ceremony.
3.2.3.22.4	If they are absent, others may officiate.
3.2.3.22.5	When one offers to the same deities, the offerings become similar. Thus the arms become similar and equal.
3.2.3.23.1	At the Pravargya, he offers to five deities; at the Udayaniya, he offers to the same five deities.
3.2.3.23.2-8	Therefore, there are five fingers here and five fingers there. It becomes the same. They do not offer the wives. The arms are in the front half of the body. He makes the front half of this sacrifice. Therefore, it becomes the same. They do not offer the wife.
3.2.4.1.1	Soma was in heaven, then the gods were here.
3.2.4.1.2	The gods desired, "May Soma come to us."
3.2.4.1.3	With him having come, we shall perform sacrifice."
3.2.4.1.4	They created these two illusions, Suparni and Kadru.
3.2.4.1.5	This is explained in the Brāhmaṇa of the Hiṣṇyas, how it was the Suparni and the Kadru.
3.2.4.2.1	From them, Soma fell down in the form of Gāyatrī.
3.2.4.2.2	When she was bringing it, the Gandharva Vishavasu stole it away.
3.2.4.2.3	The gods knew that Soma had fallen away beyond (the world of the gods).
3.2.4.2.4	But it does not come to us.
3.2.4.2.5	The Gandharvas have stolen it away.'
3.2.4.3.1	They said, 'The Gandharvas are desirous of women.
3.2.4.3.2	We shall send them speech.
3.2.4.3.3	She will come to us with Soma.'
3.2.4.3.4	He sent speech to them.
3.2.4.3.5	It came with Soma.
3.2.4.4.1	The Gandharvas followed and said, "Soma is yours."
3.2.4.4.2	"Speech is ours."
3.2.4.4.3	The gods said, "So be it."
3.2.4.4.4	"If it comes here, we will curse it as we would a maiden."
3.2.4.4.5	"We will lament."
3.2.4.4.6	They lamented.
3.2.4.5.1	The Gandharvas, having created the Vedas, said to her, "We know you."
3.2.4.6.1	Then the gods, having created the lute, sat down playing and singing, saying, "We shall sing to you."
3.2.4.6.2	She approached the gods.
3.2.4.6.3	That which she (the goddess) bestowed on them was fruitless, for it was bestowed on those who praised and sang.
3.2.4.6.4	Even now women are fruitless.
3.2.4.6.5	Thus speech was bestowed on them, and other women followed it.
3.2.4.6.6	Therefore, those who dance and sing, they are like the most beautiful of the Nimiśa trees.
3.2.4.7.1	Now, both of these were among the gods: Soma and speech.
3.2.4.7.2	When he buys Soma, he buys it for the coming (Soma) and the gone (Soma).
3.2.4.7.3	He who offers with Soma not bought, offers with the Soma that has not come.
3.2.4.8.1	Now, when there is leftover ghee in the Hruva vessel, he takes it four times in the Juhu vessel.
3.2.4.8.2	Having bound the gold with the sacrificial grass, he offers it, saying, "I offer with the entire milk."
3.2.4.8.3	Milk and gold have the same origin.
3.2.4.8.4	For both are Agni's semen.
3.2.4.9.1	He places the gold, saying, "This is your bright body, this is your radiance."
3.2.4.9.2	For gold is indeed radiance.
3.2.4.9.3	"He says, 'May I go to the shining one by means of that.' He says, 'May you go to the shining by means of that,' meaning, 'May you be united with that.'
3.2.4.9.4	'May I go to shining.'
3.2.4.9.5	Soma is shining.
3.2.4.9.6	He says, 'Go to Soma,' meaning, 'Go to the Soma.'
3.2.4.10.1	Just as the gods sent her to Soma, so does he send her to Soma.
3.2.4.10.2	The Soma-purchasing cow is indeed speech.
3.2.4.10.3	He pleases her with this offering, thinking, "May she be pleased and buy Soma."
3.2.4.11.1	He offers, saying, "Thou art Jū."
3.2.4.11.2	This is indeed one of her names, when he says, "Thou art Ju."
3.2.4.11.3	"Held in the mind."
3.2.4.11.4	This speech is held in the mind.
3.2.4.11.5	The mind is in front of speech, thinking, "Speak thus, do not speak thus."
3.2.4.11.6	The speech of one whose mind is not present would be like a speech without a tongue.
3.2.4.11.7	Therefore he says, "Held in the mind."
3.2.4.12.1	"Favored by Vishnu," he says, "Favored by Soma." He says this, "We shall drink."
3.2.4.12.2	"Your true-flowing offspring."
3.2.4.12.3	"May you be of true-flowing offspring. Drink Soma for us." He says this.
3.2.4.12.4	"May I attain the instrument of the body, svāhā."
3.2.4.12.5	He indeed attains the instrument of the self, he who goes to the goal of the sacrifice.
3.2.4.12.6	He indeed says, "May I go to the goal of sacrifice."
3.2.4.13.1	Then he takes out the gold.
3.2.4.13.2	He makes gold among humans.
3.2.4.13.3	If he were to offer it with gold, then he would have to give away gold to the human beings.
3.2.4.13.4	One should not approach gold among human beings.
3.2.4.14.1	He takes it out, saying, "You are bright, you are the moon, you are nectar, you are for all the gods."
3.2.4.14.2	Having offered with the entire milk, he says, "Thou art bright." For it is bright.
3.2.4.14.3	"Thou art the moon." For it is the moon.
3.2.4.14.4	"Thou are the immortal." For it is immortal.
3.2.4.14.5	"Thou belongest to all gods." For it belongs to all gods.
3.2.4.14.6	Having released the grass, he spreads it on the sacrificial grass.
3.2.4.14.7	He binds the gold with a thread.
3.2.4.15.1	Having taken up another four spoonfuls of clarified butter, he says to the sacrificer, "Do you commence."
3.2.4.15.2	They spread out at the door of the Soma-shed.
3.2.4.15.3	To the south of the Soma-purchasing cow, the sacrificer stands.
3.2.4.15.4	He has indeed said to her who is already sent, "Be true."
3.2.4.15.5	The Soma-purchasing is indeed speech.
3.2.4.15.6	With this offering she sent him, saying, "I am buying Soma with a pleased (offering)."
3.2.4.16.1	Then having gone out, he recites, "Thou art the mind, thou art the intention."
3.2.4.16.2	The mind is this, the speech follows it.
3.2.4.16.3	"Thou art the wisdom, thou art the right (mind)."
3.2.4.16.4	With wisdom and wisdom, indeed, men seek to know, as if with an unspoken (speech), as if with a desire, as if with verses.
3.2.4.16.5	Therefore he says, "You are wisdom."
3.2.4.16.6	"You are the right one."
3.2.4.16.7	For this is the right one.
3.2.4.16.8	"You are a warrior, you are fit for sacrifice."
3.2.4.16.9	For this one is a warrior.
3.2.4.16.10	For this one fits for sacrifice.
3.2.4.16.11	"You have Aditi as your head on both sides."
3.2.4.16.12	When he says something that is similar to it, he does something different. When he does something different, he does something that is similar. Thus, it is both-headed.
3.2.4.16.13	Therefore, it is said, "Aditi is both-headed."
3.2.4.17.1	"May it be well-risen and well-set for us." He says, "May it be well risen for us. May it come to us."
3.2.4.17.2	"May she come back to us with Soma." Thus he says.
3.2.4.17.3	Therefore he says, "May she come to us well, may she come back to you well."
3.2.4.18.1	"May Mitra bind you on the seat."
3.2.4.18.2	The rope is indeed Varuna.
3.2.4.18.3	If it were to be tied with a rope, it would be Varuna.
3.2.4.18.4	If it were not mentioned, it would be as if it were not mentioned.
3.2.4.18.5	This is the only friendship.
3.2.4.18.6	As if bound by a rope, so it becomes for her when he says, "May Mitra bind you in the foot."
3.2.4.19.1	"May Pūṣan protect the path."
3.2.4.19.2	This earth is Pūṣan.
3.2.4.19.3	Or, if this is the guardian of the path, then for him there is no misfortune.
3.2.4.19.4	Therefore he says, "May Pūṣan protect the path."
3.2.4.20.1	"To Indra, the overseer," he says. This means, "May the overseer be well."
3.2.4.20.2-6	Let the mother, the father, the brother, the cousin, the friend, the companion be pleased with me. Whatever is your birth, by that be pleased with us. He says this, "Do thou press Soma." "Do thou press Soma, O goddess, for the god." For this is a goddess, and she presses Soma for the god. Therefore he says, "Do thou, O goddess, press Soma for the god." "For Indra, Soma."
3.2.4.20.7	Indra is the deity of the sacrifice.
3.2.4.20.8	Therefore he says, "Indra to Soma."
3.2.4.20.9	"May Rudra turn you back," he says for non-destruction.
3.2.4.20.10	For cattle do not exceed Rudra.
3.2.4.20.11	"May you return safely with Soma as your companion," he says, "May you return safely to us with Soma."
3.2.4.21.1	Just as the gods sent her to Soma, so she comes with Soma. In the same way he sends her to him.
3.2.4.21.2	She comes with Soma.
3.2.4.22.1	Just as the gods sent him to Gandharva, so she comes to the gods. In the same manner the sacrificer sends her to him.
3.2.4.22.2	She approaches the sacrificer.
3.2.4.22.3	They make her go beyond the northern direction.
3.2.4.22.4	For the northern direction is the direction of men.
3.2.4.22.5	It is the sacrificer's own.
3.2.4.22.6	Therefore they make her go beyond (the northern direction).
3.3.1.1.1	He steps seven steps following (her).
3.3.1.1.2	He thus takes possession of her.
3.3.1.1.3	Therefore he steps seven steps following.
3.3.1.1.4	Where the Vedas were born, the seven feet of the metres, the Sakvari is the last of them.
3.3.1.1.5	He thus takes it from the other side.
3.3.1.1.6	Therefore he goes forward seven steps.
3.3.1.2.1	He goes forward in the form of speech, saying, 'Thou art Vasu, thou art Aditi, thou art Aditya, thou art Rudra, thou art Chandra.'
3.3.1.2.2	This is the Vasu, this is the Aditi, this is the Aditya, this is the Rudra, this is the Chandra.
3.3.1.2.3	May Brihaspati delight in your good wishes.
3.3.1.2.4	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman.
3.3.1.2.5	He says, "May Brihaspati lead you to the good."
3.3.1.2.6	"Rudra with the Vasus has come," he says this for non-destruction.
3.3.1.2.7	For indeed, the cattle do not exceed Rudra.
3.3.1.3.1	Then they sit down on the seventh step.
3.3.1.3.2	He places the gold on the step and offers.
3.3.1.3.3	For an oblation is not offered in a non-fire.
3.3.1.3.4	Gold is indeed the semen of Agni.
3.3.1.3.5	Thus his oblation is offered beyond Agni.
3.3.1.3.6	The ladle is the thunderbolt.
3.3.1.3.7	He touches it with the thunderbolt.
3.3.1.3.8	Having touched it, he takes it up.
3.3.1.4.1	He offers with the verse, "I offer thee on the head of Aditi."
3.3.1.4.2	This earth is Aditi.
3.3.1.4.3	He offers on her head.
3.3.1.4.4	"In the sacrifice to the gods on earth,"
3.3.1.4.5	He offers in the sacrifice to the god on earth.
3.3.1.4.6	"This is the place of Ida, with ghee, svāhā."
3.3.1.4.7	Ida is a cow.
3.3.1.4.8	For one offers on the place of a cow.
3.3.1.4.9	"With ghee, svāha."
3.3.1.4.10	For this is offered with ghee.
3.3.1.5.1	Then, taking the wooden sword, he draws around.
3.3.1.5.2	The wooden sword is indeed the thunderbolt.
3.3.1.5.3	He draws around with the thunderbolt.
3.3.1.5.4	One draws around three times.
3.3.1.5.5	He encloses it completely with the Trivrit (verse) for the purpose of not transgressing.
3.3.1.6.1	He draws a line, saying, 'May you delight in us.'
3.3.1.6.2	He means to say, 'May you be delighted in the sacrificer.'
3.3.1.6.3	Having drawn a line, he pours the rice into the vessel, saying, 'Your friend is in us.'
3.3.1.6.4	Here he means to say, ‘Your friend is in the sacrificer.’
3.3.1.7.1	Then he places it near.
3.3.1.7.2	Where they dig up his body, they make it cruel, they destroy it. Water is peace. He appeases it with water, he joins it with water.
3.3.1.7.3	Therefore he brings it down from there.
3.3.1.8.1	Then he gives the place to the sacrificer, saying, "In you is wealth."
3.3.1.8.2	Wealth is cattle.
3.3.1.8.3	He means to say, "In you are cattle."
3.3.1.8.4	The sacrificer receives it with the words, "May wealth be mine."
3.3.1.8.5	Wealth indeed is cattle.
3.3.1.8.6	He thereby says, "May cattle be mine."
3.3.1.9.1	Then the Adhvaryu touches himself with the words, “May we not be separated from the prosperity of wealth.”
3.3.1.9.2	Thus the Adhvaryus does not separate himself from the cattle.
3.3.1.10.1	Then they take back the step for the wife.
3.3.1.10.2	The house is the foundation of the wife.
3.3.1.10.3	He thus establishes her in the house itself, in the foundation.
3.3.1.10.4	Therefore they take a step back for the wife.
3.3.1.11.1	The priest makes her recite the verse, "May we be blessed with wealth."
3.3.1.11.2	Then he makes her count with the Soma-purchasing formula.
3.3.1.11.3	Soma is indeed a bull.
3.3.1.11.4	The wife is a woman.
3.3.1.11.5	This is indeed the Soma here, which is the Soma-purchasing cow.
3.3.1.11.6	It is indeed a union, a begetting, that is being done.
3.3.1.11.7	Therefore he makes her known by the Soma-purchaser.
3.3.1.12.1	He makes her known, saying, 'By the known goddess, by the knowing, by the seeing, may you not take away my life, may I know your hero, may I see you, O goddess.' He thus prays for a blessing.
3.3.1.12.2	The son is indeed a hero.
3.3.1.12.3	He says this: "I will give you a son to see."
3.3.1.13.1	She who is tawny and has red eyes, she is the one to be bought for Soma.
3.3.1.13.2	Where Indra and Vishnu divided the thousand into three parts, one part remained over.
3.3.1.13.3	They generated her in three ways.
3.3.1.13.4	Therefore, even if someone today were to describe it in three ways, there would be only one excess.
3.3.1.14.1	She who is tawny and has reddish eyes, she is the Soma-purchasing (cow).
3.3.1.14.2	Then she who is reddish, she is the slayer of Vritra, whom the king, having won the battle, releases.
3.3.1.14.3	Then she who has reddish-brown eyes, she is related to the Pitrs, whom they offer to the Pitrs.
3.3.1.15.1	If she is a tawny-coloured cow with red eyes, she should be the one bought for Soma.
3.3.1.15.2	If one cannot find a tawny-coloured and red-eyed cow, it should be a reddish-brown cow.
3.3.1.15.3	If one does not find a reddish-brown one, it should be an ox-killer cow.
3.3.1.15.4	One should give the reddish-brown cow to the one with red eyes.
3.3.1.16.1	It should be an uncastrated cow.
3.3.1.16.2	The Soma-purchasing cow is indeed this speech in its origin.
3.3.1.16.3	This speech is not exhausted.
3.3.1.16.4	It is not exhausted, not exhausted.
3.3.1.16.5	Therefore it should be not exhausted.
3.3.1.16.6	She should be without a horn, without a hump, without ears, without a tail, with seven hairs,
3.3.1.16.7	Because she is of one form.
3.3.1.16.8	This speech indeed is of one form,
3.3.2.1.1	Having filled the foot, he has put down his hands.
3.3.2.1.2	The reason why the hands are joined together is this.
3.3.2.1.3	The Soma-juice is the thunderbolt.
3.3.2.1.4	The semen is Soma.
3.3.2.1.5	" Lest he should injure the semen with the thunderbolt, the Soma-juice."
3.3.2.1.6	Therefore the hands are joined.
3.3.2.2.1	Then he binds the gold on it.
3.3.2.2.2	This is twofold, there is no third; truth and untruth.
3.3.2.2.3	Truth is the gods, untruth is men.
3.3.2.2.4	Agni is the seed of gold.
3.3.2.2.5	"One should touch the rays with truth, and should strike Soma with truth."
3.3.2.2.6	Therefore one binds gold on this (earth).
3.3.2.3.1	Then he instructs (the sacrificer), "Bring the Soma-head-cover."
3.3.2.3.2	"Bring the Soma-neck-cover."
3.3.2.3.3	Bring the turban."
3.3.2.3.4	Whatever is beautiful, that should be the Soma-headcover.
3.3.2.3.5	This is his garment.
3.3.2.3.6	This is his beautiful garment.
3.3.2.3.7	He who serves him with a beautiful garment shines.
3.3.2.3.8	And he who says, "Whatever there is," whatever there is,
3.3.2.3.9	Therefore, whatever is beautiful should be the Soma-cloth, whatever there is should be the Soma garment.
3.3.2.4.1	If he finds a turban, it would be a turban.
3.3.2.4.2	If he does not find a turban, he should cut off two or three fingers of the turban of Soma-pariyāṇahanas.
3.3.2.4.3	The Adhvaryu or the sacrificer takes the Soma-pariyānahanas, whichever they are.
3.3.2.5.1	Then they search in front of the king.
3.3.2.5.2	That is placed near the water pot.
3.3.2.5.3	That is worshipped by the Brahmanas.
3.3.2.5.4	They approach it facing east.
3.3.2.6.1	When they have approached, he recites, "This is your Gayatri portion."
3.3.2.6.2	Tell this to Soma.
3.3.2.6.3	"This is your Tristubh portion."
3.3.2.6.4	Tell it to Soma.
3.3.2.6.5	This is your Jagati portion."
3.3.2.6.6	Tell that to Soma.
3.3.2.6.7	"May he go to the sovereignty of the names of metres."
3.3.2.6.8	"May he tell Soma."
3.3.2.6.9	He is bought for one thing only, for the sovereignty of the metres, for the sovereignty over the metres.
3.3.2.6.10	They indeed kill him when they consecrate him.
3.3.2.6.11	He says this to him: "I buy you for the sovereignty of metres, for the supremacy of metres, not for killing."
3.3.2.8.1	Here some, having cut grass or wood, throw it away.
3.3.2.8.2	One should not do so.
3.3.2.8.3	Soma is the king,
3.3.2.8.4	other plants are the people.
3.3.2.8.5	The people are the food of the king.
3.3.2.8.6	Just as one would cut and throw away what has been swallowed, so should one do.
3.3.2.8.7	Therefore one should rub it, saying, "May the people rub you."
3.3.2.8.8	Those who are his advisers, they advise him.
3.3.2.9.1	Then he spreads the garment either twice or four times the length of the king, or in the east or in the north.
3.3.2.9.2	He measures the king.
3.3.2.9.3	Because he measures the king, therefore among men there is a measure, and there is a measure for whatever else there is.
3.3.2.10.1	He measures with the Savitri verse.
3.3.2.10.2	Savitar is the impeller of the gods.
3.3.2.10.3	Thus indeed, he becomes one who is impelled by Savitar for purchase.
3.3.2.11.1	He measures with the Atichandas metre.
3.3.2.11.2	This is indeed all the metres, namely the Atichandas.
3.3.2.11.3	Thus indeed he becomes measured by all the metres.
3.3.2.11.4	Therefore he measures with the Ati- chandas metre.
3.3.2.12.1	He worships the god Savitar, the impeller, the one with the power of the poet, the one who bestows the true, the one who gives the treasure, the one who has the beloved mind, the one who is the poet, whose mind shines upward in the assembly, the one with golden hands, the one with good power, the one who measures the sky.
3.3.2.13.1	With this (verse) with all (the verses), with these four, with these three, with these two, with this one.
3.3.2.13.2	With this one alone, with these three (verses), with these four (verses), with all (the remaining verses).
3.3.2.13.3	He sprinkles with the Samasya Anjali.
3.3.2.14.1	He measures out the Udaya and Nyacha.
3.3.2.14.2	When he makes the fingers of the right hand different, he makes these fingers of the right (hand) different.
3.3.2.14.3	Therefore these fingers are born different.
3.3.2.14.4	When he makes them all together,
3.3.2.14.5	they would be as if joined together.
3.3.2.14.6	Therefore he makes the fingers different.
3.3.2.15.1	When indeed he makes the fingers (of the right hand) different,
3.3.2.15.2	He thus makes them of different powers.
3.3.2.15.3	Therefore they are of different powers.  
3.3.2.15.4	Therefore he measures the Udag and Nyag.
3.3.2.16.1	In that he measures the Udg and Nyag, he thus unites the Viraj in the forward and backward directions.
3.3.2.16.2	The sacrifice is carried to the gods in the forward direction.
3.3.2.16.3	It nourishes men in the backward direction.
3.3.2.16.4	Therefore he measures it from the Udagam and Nyagam.
3.3.2.17.1	And why he measures it ten times,
3.3.2.17.2	the Viraj has ten syllables,
3.3.2.17.3	Soma is Viraj,
3.3.2.17.4	therefore he measures it tenfold.
3.3.2.18.1	Then he binds the ends of the Soma-cloth with the turban, saying, "For the subjects."
3.3.2.18.2	For he buys it for the subjects.
3.3.2.18.3	Whatever this head and shoulders are, as if joined together, he does the same to it.
3.3.2.19.1	Then he makes a space between the fingers in the middle, saying, "May the people breathe after you."
3.3.2.19.2	He seems to be joining it together.
3.3.2.19.3	He makes it as if without breath.
3.3.2.19.4	He releases the breath from the middle of it.
3.3.2.19.5	Then the creatures breathe after him as he breathes.
3.3.2.19.6	Therefore he says, 'May the creatures breathe after you.'
3.3.2.19.7	He gives him to the seller of Soma.
3.3.2.19.8	Now then, of the buying itself.
3.3.3.1.1	He buys the king.
3.3.3.1.2	Because he buys the king, therefore all this is bought only once.
3.3.3.1.3	He says, 'O seller of Soma, your king Soma is for sale.'
3.3.3.1.4	The Soma-seller says, "You may buy."
3.3.3.1.5	"I will buy it from you."
3.3.3.1.6	The Soma-seller says "Buy."
3.3.3.1.7	"I buy it from you for a cow."
3.3.3.1.8	"Soma is worth more than that," says the Soma-seller.
3.3.3.1.9	"Soma is indeed worth more than that."
3.3.3.1.10	"The cow is indeed great in its greatness," says the Adhvaryu.
3.3.3.2.1	The cow is the counter-gift. The curds are for her, the whey is for her, the cream is for her, butter is for her, ghee is for her, milk-rice is for her, and the cake is for her.
3.3.3.3.1	"I buy it with the hoof."
3.3.3.3.2	"The seller of Soma says, "Soma, the king, is worth more than this."
3.3.3.3.3	Soma, the king is worth more than that.
3.3.3.3.4	The Adhvaryu says, "The cow is indeed great."
3.3.3.3.5	Having mentioned these ten kinds of strength, he says, "I buy it with half of yours, with your cow."
3.3.3.3.6	The buyer of Soma says, "Soma is bought by the king."
3.3.3.3.7	He says, "Tell me the ages."
3.3.3.4.1	He says, "Your cloth, your sheep, your cow, your pair of cows, your three other cows."
3.3.3.4.2	When they bargain below the price, the other person makes it up. Therefore, all this is bought at a fixed price.
3.3.3.4.3	They bargain below the price and the other person makes up.
3.3.3.4.4	Now, when the Adhvaryu alone declares the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller, it is because Soma is great. Soma is a divine god.
3.3.3.4.5	And the Adhvaryus praises the cow, and he sees her virtues and buys them.
3.3.3.4.6	Therefore the Adhvaryū alone declares the virtues, and not the seller of Soma.
3.3.3.5.1	Now, why he recites five times.
3.3.3.5.2	The sacrifice is equal to a year.
3.3.3.5.3	There are five seasons in a year.
3.3.3.5.4	He obtains it by five.
3.3.3.5.5	Therefore he recites five (times).
3.3.3.6.1	Then he recites on gold, "I buy you with bright (gold) with bright (gold)."
3.3.3.6.2	For indeed, he buys Soma with gold, buying it with Soma.
3.3.3.6.3	"For the moon with the moon."
3.3.3.6.4	For indeed, he buys the moon with gold, buying the moon with gold.
3.3.3.6.5	"For immortality with immortality."
3.3.3.6.6	For indeed he buys immortality with gold, buying immortality with gold.
3.3.3.7.1	Then he shakes the Soma-seller with the verse, "Thy cow is in thy womb."
3.3.3.7.2	He means to say, "Thy cow belongs to the sacrificer."
3.3.3.7.3	Having brought the sacrificer near, he places him (in the shed) with the verse, "Thy moon is in us."
3.3.3.7.4	He places his own strength in himself.
3.3.3.7.5	The Soma-seller takes away the body.
3.3.3.7.6	The Soma seller takes it from there.
3.3.3.8.1-6	Then he makes her recite the verse, "Thou art the body of Tapas." For this (animal) indeed is produced from the Tapas of Prajapati. Therefore he says, "Thou art a body of Tapas." "Thou art the colour of Prajapati." For she gives birth three times in a year, and that is the colour of Prajapatl. "Thou art bought with the highest animal."
3.3.3.8.7	When she gives birth three times in a year, then she is the supreme animal.
3.3.3.8.8	He prays for the blessing, "May I prosper with a thousand."
3.3.3.8.9	The thousand is indeed the earth.
3.3.3.8.10	He says, "May I go to the earth."
3.3.3.9.1	He gives the goat with this (verse).
3.3.3.9.2	He takes the king with this (verse)
3.3.3.9.3	This is indeed the name of the goat.
3.3.3.9.4	For it is by this that he finally reaches him.
3.3.3.9.5	They say that this is the remote (form of) the animal.
3.3.3.10.1	Then he takes the king, saying, 'O friend, come, with good friendship.'
3.3.3.10.2	He says, 'May he be auspicious and peaceful to us.'
3.3.3.10.3	Having placed it on the right thigh of the sacrificer, he puts on the garment, saying, 'Enter Indra's right thigh.'
3.3.3.10.4	This indeed is Indra here, who is the sacrificer.
3.3.3.10.5	Therefore he says, "Indra, enter my right thigh."
3.3.3.10.6	"The hot one, the hot one," he says; that is, "the dear one, the dear one."
3.3.3.10.7	"The auspicious, the auspicious," he says; this means "the auspicious, the auspicious."
3.3.3.11.1	Then he points out the Soma-purchasers: "Your own shining feet, your own shining feet, in the Bambhara, in the Hasta, in the Suhasta, in the Krsana, these are your Soma-purchasers; protect them, do not let them be harmed."
3.3.3.11.2	These are the portions of the Dhiṣṇyas.
3.3.3.11.3	These are the names of the Dhişṇyas.
3.3.3.11.4	He pointed out to them these very (names).
3.3.3.12.1	Here he pours down water.
3.3.3.12.2	The one who is initiated is like a foetus.
3.3.3.12.3	The foetus is covered, as it were, by the amnion and the placenta.
3.3.3.12.4	They generated him here.
3.3.3.12.5	Therefore he is covered.
3.3.3.12.6	Here he is like a foetal being.
3.3.3.12.7	Therefore he becomes covered.
3.3.3.12.8	The foetal being is covered, as if by the amnion, as if by placenta.
3.3.3.13.1	Or he recites: "O Agni, protect me from evil conduct, let me be devoted to good conduct."
3.3.3.13.2	He comes to him while he is seated.
3.3.3.13.3	He gets up when he has come.
3.3.3.13.4	He does wrong, he transgresses the vow.
3.3.3.13.5	This is his expiation.
3.3.3.13.6	Thus his is not done wrongly,
3.3.3.13.7	he does not transgress the vow.
3.3.3.13.8	Therefore he says, "O Agni, protect me from evil conduct, and let me enjoy good conduct."
3.3.3.14.1	Then, taking the king, he rises, saying, "I rise with life, I stand with life, I follow the immortal."
3.3.3.14.2	He who buys Soma rises following the immortal.
3.3.3.14.3	Therefore he says, "I rise, I stand with the life, I follow immortality."
3.3.3.15.1	Then, taking the king, he proceeds to the ascent, along the path of the gods, free from obstacles, auspicious, without distress, by which one encircles all enemies and obtains prosperity.
3.3.3.16.1	The gods, while performing the sacrifice, feared the attachment to the demons and Rākṣasas.
3.3.3.16.2	They saw this Yajus as a means of well-being.
3.3.3.16.3	Having thus removed the Rakshas and the evil spirits by means of this formula, they attained safety, freedom from fear, freedom from evil, and peace.
3.3.3.16.4	In the same way, he, having thus removed the Rakṣas and the evil forces by means of this mantra, attains safety, freedom from danger, freedom from evil and peace.
3.3.3.16.5	Therefore he says, "May I go along the path that is free from thorns, that is auspicious, that is without fear, by which one overcomes all enemies and obtains prosperity."
3.3.3.17.1	They carry him with the words, "That one."
3.3.3.17.2	They carry it with the words, "Anasa."
3.3.3.17.3	They honor him with the words "Mahas."
3.3.3.17.4	Therefore they carry the seed with the head.
3.3.3.17.5	They carry it down with the words "Anasa." The seed is carried down with the words, "Anasa."
3.3.3.18.1	And why he buys it at the end of the water,
3.3.3.18.2	The Soma is the waters.
3.3.3.18.3	He buys it as having the Soma.
3.3.3.18.4	When it is gold, he buys it as having semen.
3.3.3.18.5	When it has clothes, he buys it with skin.
3.3.3.18.6	When it (consists of) a she-goat, he buys it having heat.
3.3.3.18.7	When it consists of a milch cow, he buys it for having a mouth.
3.3.4.1.2	He is indeed a relative.
3.3.4.1.3	Then he approaches him, saying, "You have sat down with Aditi."
3.3.4.1.4	This earth is Aditi.
3.3.4.1.5	This is the foundation.
3.3.4.1.6	He thus establishes him in this very foundation.
3.3.4.1.7	Therefore he says, "You have taken your seat with Aditi."
3.3.4.2.1	Then, having thus resolved, he recites: "The bull has firmly established the sky and the atmosphere."
3.3.4.2.2	Indeed, the gods, while performing the sacrifice, feared the attachment to the Asura demons.
3.3.4.2.3	They made him the superior one in killing, when he said: "The bull firmly established the sky, the atmosphere."
3.3.4.3.1	He measured out the extent of the earth. By this he touches these worlds.
3.3.4.3.2	For there is no slayer or killer by which these worlds are touched.
3.3.4.3.3	Therefore he says, 'He measured out the extent...'
3.3.4.4.1	He became the lord of all the worlds. By this he now touches everything.
3.3.4.4.2	For he is not a slayer, nor is there any slaying, by which all this has been pervaded.
3.3.4.4.3	Therefore he says, 'The All-Ruler, the All-Ruler.'
3.3.4.5.1	'All these are Varuna's laws,' thus he makes all this follow him, whatever there is, and no one opposes him.
3.3.4.5.2	Therefore he say, 'All these are Varun's laws.'
3.3.4.6.1	Then he performs the Soma-pariaṇahya rite. The Pariaṇahya is performed so that the demons and the Rākṣasas may not injure him.
3.3.4.6.2	This (Soma) indeed becomes a foetus.
3.3.4.6.3	The foetus is like a shadow.
3.3.4.6.4	This Pariaṇahye rite is like a shadow
3.3.4.6.5	The gods are like a shadow to men.
3.3.4.6.6	This Pariahṇahya rite is like a shade.
3.3.4.6.7	Therefore he performs the Pariaṇahyd rite.
3.3.4.7.1	He spreads it out in the forests, he spreads it out in heaven.
3.3.4.7.2	In the forests here heaven is spread out on the tops of the trees.
3.3.4.7.3	The strength in the stallions, the milk in the mares.
3.3.4.7.4	Strength indeed is the strength.
3.3.4.7.5	The stallions are the males.
3.3.4.7.6	He places the strength in the males.
3.3.4.7.7	The milk in the mares,
3.3.4.7.8	For the milk here is in the mares.
3.3.4.7.9	In the hearts, Varuna has placed the sacrifice, Agni in all directions.
3.3.4.7.10	For in the hearts this sacrifice, swift as thought, has entered.
3.3.4.7.11	In all directions, Agni.
3.3.4.7.12	For in all directions this Agni is in the creatures.
3.3.4.7.13	In heaven he placed the sun, he drove Soma.
3.3.4.7.14	For in heaven this sun is placed.
3.3.4.7.15	He drove Soma.
3.3.4.7.16	Soma is on the mountains.
3.3.4.7.17	Therefore he says, "He placed the sun in heaven, he drove Soma."
3.3.4.8.1	If there are two black antelope skins, he puts on the other one. The other one is the receptacle of the Prati-naha.
3.3.4.8.2	If there is only one, he takes off the skin of the black antelope from the neck and puts it back on. The sun's eye is the eye of Agni. The eye of Agni is the eye of the sun. Where you are led by the tawny ones, shining, by the wise.
3.3.4.8.3	He thus places the sun in front. The sun removes the demons and the Rakshas in front.
3.3.4.8.4	Then they carry it with the Abhijit and Anashti formulas.
3.3.4.9.1	The Uddhata and Prāgya formulas are used for the wooden plank.
3.3.4.9.2	Standing between them, the Subrahmanya priest moves forward.
3.3.4.9.3	This is indeed a better ascent.
3.3.4.9.4	Who is worthy of ascending this?
3.3.4.9.5	Therefore, standing between them, he moves forward.
3.3.4.10.1	He moves forward with a Palasha branch.
3.3.4.10.2	Where the Gāyatrī fell down while pressing the Soma, her feet were cut off by the leaves of the tree as she was coming. It was either for the Gāyatrīs or for the king Soma.
3.3.4.10.3	Having fallen, it became a leaf.
3.3.4.10.4	Therefore, its name is Palāśa.
3.3.4.10.5	Whatever was missing in the Soma here, that is also here.
3.3.4.10.6	Therefore, one goes with a Palāśa branch.
3.3.4.11.1	Then they yoke the oxen.
3.3.4.11.2	If they are black or one of them is black, then one should know that there will be rain, that the rain god will be generous and there will be rain.
3.3.4.11.3	This is the knowledge.
3.3.4.12.1	Then he yokes the oxen, saying, "These are the oxen."
3.3.4.12.2	They are oxen.
3.3.4.12.3	"These are the oxen,"
3.3.4.12.4	They are oxen.
3.3.4.12.5	"You should be united without tears."
3.3.4.12.6	"They are united without tears," means "without distress."
3.3.4.12.7	"That is without injury," means "without sin."
3.3.4.12.8	"They give the Brahma-instruction."
3.3.4.12.9	"They do give the Brahma-instructions."
3.3.4.12.10	"May you go to the house of the sacrificer with welfare."
3.3.4.12.11	So that the demons and the Rākṣasas may not injure him in between, he says this.
3.3.4.13.1	Then having gone round on the right side and having taken hold of the Apālam, he says, "Recite for Soma bought." "For Soma being led around," he says, whichever way he may desire.
3.3.4.14.1	Then he recites, "You are auspicious to me. Go away, O lord of the earth."
3.3.4.14.2	For he is indeed auspicious to him.
3.3.4.14.3-11	Therefore, he does not desire anything else. Even the kings who are his partners come to him. The king greets first. Because he is auspicious. Therefore, he says, "You are auspicious to me." "Depart, O Lord of the Earth," he says. Because he indeed is the Lord of the Worlds. "All the abodes," he says. The abodes are indeed all the limbs.
3.3.4.14.12	These are the limbs of the sacrifice.
3.3.4.14.13	"May those who are on the other side of you not know you, may those who are on your way not know you, and may the wolves with evil intentions not know you."
3.3.4.14.14	So that the demons and the Raksases do not find him in between.
3.3.4.15.1	"Having become a hawk, fall down."
3.3.4.15.2	He thus causes him to fall down as he is.
3.3.4.15.3	Or, what is fierce, the demons and Rākṣasas do not follow.
3.3.4.15.4	This is indeed the most powerful and strongest of birds, namely the hawk.
3.3.4.15.5	He indeed makes it fall down to the real world when he says, "Becoming a hawk, fly away."
3.3.4.16.1	Then they follow the body.
3.3.4.16.2	Go to the house of the sacrificer. This is our sanctified (body).
3.3.4.16.3	There is nothing hidden here.
3.3.4.17.1	Then he calls out to Subrahmanya:
3.3.4.17.2	"As one would say to those who are going to be sacrificed, 'I am sacrificing for you,' so he informs the gods of the sacrifice."
3.3.4.17.3	"Subrahmanya, Subrahmanya."
3.3.4.17.4	Brahma indeed separates the gods.
3.3.4.17.5	He says it three times.
3.3.4.17.6	The sacrifice is threefold.
3.3.4.18.1	"Come, O Indra!"
3.3.4.18.2	Indra is the deity of the sacrifice.
3.3.4.18.3	Therefore he says, "Come, O Indra."
3.3.4.18.4	"Come, Hari! Come, Medhatithi! Come, to the ram of Vrusanasva! Come, to Gauravaskandin! Come, to Ahalya's husband!"
3.3.4.18.5	He thus delights him with those very steps.
3.3.4.19.1	Kausika, the Brahman Gautama is speaking."
3.3.4.19.2	This has always been known by Aruṇi that Gautama is speaking. If he wishes to speak, he may do so. If he does not wish to speak, he need not.
3.3.4.19.3	Thus, until the day of the Soma sacrifice.
3.3.4.20.1	The gods, the Brahmans, are coming."
3.3.4.20.2	This refers to both the gods and the Brahmans.
3.3.4.20.3	For it is by these two, the gods and the Brahmanas, that the purpose is accomplished.
3.3.4.21.1	Then the Pratiprasthātṛ stands in front of the hall with the animal for Agni-Soma.
3.3.4.21.2	Agni-Soma indeed place him in the womb who consecrates himself.
3.3.4.21.3	For the offering for consecration is indeed to Agni-Visnu.
3.3.4.21.4	For he who is Visnu is Soma.
3.3.4.21.5	The one who consecrates himself becomes the oblation.
3.3.4.21.6	They place him in the middle of the fire.
3.3.4.21.7	He redeems himself with an animal.
3.3.4.22.1	Some bring a torch from the Āhavanīya fire, saying, "This is Agni, this is Soma, we will redeem ourselves with these two good ones."
3.3.4.22.2	One should not do that.
3.3.4.22.3	Where are these two? And where is that? Together.
3.3.4.23.1	He becomes of two forms.
3.3.4.23.2	For he becomes of two deities.
3.3.4.23.3	They say that the black antelope skin should be for the deities, for this is the best form of them.
3.3.4.23.4	If one does not find a black antelope skin, then one should use a red antelope skin.
3.3.4.24.1	He recites over it, "Salutations to Mitra and Varuna, to the great god, to the one who sees afar, to the one of divine birth, to the banner, to the son of heaven, to Surya, to the one praised."
3.3.4.24.2	He does this as a salutation to him.
3.3.4.24.3	He makes him a friend through this.
3.3.4.25.1	Then the Adhvaryu releases the ascent.
3.3.4.25.2	"Thou art the support of Varuna", he supports it with the support.
3.3.4.25.3	"Thou art the support and the loosening of Varuna", with this he loosens the Soma from the Samyu.
3.3.4.25.4	When he says, "Thou art the loosening of Varun's support", then indeed he becomes Varuna's.
3.3.4.26.1	Then four kings take up the royal couch.
3.3.4.26.2	Two men give it to the human king.
3.3.4.26.3	Then four give it to him, for he is the one who desires everything.
3.3.4.27.1	It is made of Udumbara wood.
3.3.4.27.2	Udumbara is food and energy.
3.3.4.27.3	For the securing of food and energy,
3.3.4.27.4	therefore it is made of Udumvara wood.
3.3.4.28.1	It is of the height of the navel.
3.3.4.28.2	Here food is established.
3.3.4.28.3	Soma is food.
3.3.4.28.4	Therefore, one does not become afflicted with hunger.
3.3.4.28.5	Here alone is the receptacle of semen.
3.3.4.28.6	Semen is Soma.
3.3.4.28.7	Therefore, here one does not become affected by hunger.
3.3.4.29.1	He touches it, saying, "You are the seat of truth of Varuna."
3.3.4.29.2	He spreads a black antelope skin, saying, "This is the seat of truth for Varuna."
3.3.4.29.3	Then he makes him sit down, saying, "Thou sittest down in the abode of truth of Varuna."
3.3.4.29.4	When he says, "Thou sitest down in the abode (of truth) of Varuna," then indeed he becomes Varuna's.
3.3.4.30.1	Then he makes him enter the hall.
3.3.4.30.2	When he is entering, he makes him recite, "All thy abodes which they worship with oblations, may they be thy universal protector at the sacrifice.
3.3.4.30.3	"May Gayasphana, the ferryman, the very heroic, the destroyer of foes, may Soma, the very heroic one, go to the difficult places."
3.3.4.30.4	The difficult places are the houses.
3.3.4.30.5	He says this: "May he go to our houses, the auspicious, the peaceful, the sinless one."
3.3.4.31.1	Here some place a water-pot, saying, "Just as water is brought when the king arrives, so is this."
3.3.4.31.2	One should not do that.
3.3.4.31.3	They perform the human sacrifice.
3.3.4.31.4	The human sacrifice is a deviation from the sacrifice.
3.3.4.31.5	"One should not perform a deviation from the rite."
3.3.4.31.6	Therefore, one should not perform it.
3.4.1.1.1	The hospitality is the head of the sacrifice, the Prāyaṇīya and Udayaniya are the arms.
3.4.1.1.2	The arms are on both sides of the head.
3.4.1.1.3	Therefore, the two offerings are made before and after the Atithya.
3.4.1.2.1	Now, why is it called Atithya?
3.4.1.2.2	When Soma is bought, it is as if a guest has come to him.
3.4.1.2.3	Therefore, this is like cooking a great feast for a king or a brahmin or a great ox or a great goat. That is the human offering.
3.4.1.2.4	The offering of the gods.
3.4.1.2.5	Thus he performs this hospitality for them.
3.4.1.3.1	They say, "One should take it after having passed the former."
3.4.1.3.2	Where they do not honour the one who has arrived, he gets angry there.
3.4.1.3.3	Thus he is honoured.
3.4.1.4.1	Or one of them may be released, while the other is not released.
3.4.1.4.2	Then one should take it.
3.4.1.4.3	If one of them is released, he comes back.
3.4.1.4.4	If the other is not released, he is deprived.
3.4.1.5.1	One should not do that.
3.4.1.5.2	One should release and then take.
3.4.1.5.3	The way of the gods or the way of men.
3.4.1.5.4-8	Therefore, as long as a human being does not release, they do not bring water to him, nor do they perform the obsequies. Because he is not yet come. But when he releases, then they bring water to him and perform the obsequies.
3.4.1.6.1	He should take it as if he were in a hurry.
3.4.1.6.2	For that is how it becomes purified.
3.4.1.6.3	The wife follows him.
3.4.1.6.4	The sacrificer follows the one who is being led around. Here the wife follows from both sides.
3.4.1.6.5	They follow it with the pair.
3.4.1.6.6	Wherever the deserving one comes, all the householders follow him as if.
3.4.1.6.7	Thus he becomes purified.
3.4.1.7.1	He should take it with another Yajus, with which the other oblations are taken.
3.4.1.7.2	When he is being bought, he is bought for one part, for the kingship of the Vedas, for the sovereignty of the Vedas.
3.4.1.7.3	The Vedas are his allies.
3.4.1.7.4	Just as the non-kings, the cooks and the village-officers, are near the king, so are the metres near the sacrifice.
3.4.1.8.1	It is not proper to take only what is not included in the metres.
3.4.1.8.2	Where the deserving ones cook, the non-kings are near them, the cooks and village-officers, who are near the king.
3.4.1.10.4	He shares it with the Tristubh.
3.4.1.11.1	"You are the hospitality of the guest, for Vishnu thee."
3.4.1.11.2	This is his release.
3.4.1.11.3	Just as the release of the best, so is this of him, except for the metres.
3.4.1.12.1	"For thee, O Soma-bearing hawk, for Vishnu thee,"
3.4.1.12.2	He shares it with the Gayatri.
3.4.1.12.3	When she, having become a hawk, brought down the Soma from heaven, she became the hawk, the Soma-bearer.
3.4.1.12.4	By that very power he now shares her a second time.
3.4.1.13.1	"To Agni thee, to the giver of wealth and prosperity! To Vishnu thee!"
3.4.1.13.2	Wealth and prosperity are cattle.
3.4.1.13.3	The Jagati is cattle.
3.4.1.13.4	He shares the Jagati.
3.4.1.14.1	Now, why he takes it five times?
3.4.1.14.2	The sacrifice is equal to a year.
3.4.1.14.3	There are five seasons in a year.
3.4.1.14.4	He obtains it by means of five.
3.4.1.14.5	Therefore he takes it fivefold.
3.4.1.14.6	And why he takes it saying, "To Vishnu thee, to Vishnu thee," he takes it to Vishnu, for he who takes it for the sacrifice takes it to Vishnu.
3.4.1.16.2	The gods saw this tree, the Karṣmarya, as the destroyer of demons.
3.4.1.16.3	The head is the guest-offering of the sacrifice.
3.4.1.16.4	"So that the head of the sacrifice may not be destroyed by the demons and the Rakṣas."
3.4.1.16.5	Therefore the enclosing sticks are made of Karṣmarya wood.
3.4.1.17.1	The sacrificial grass is of Aśvalā grass.
3.4.1.17.2	The sacrifice fled from the gods.
3.4.1.17.3	He became a horse and turned away.
3.4.1.17.4	The gods, having shaken off the hair,
3.4.1.17.5	they plucked them.
3.4.1.17.6	Having plucked them, they joined them together.
3.4.1.17.7	Then these plants came into being, which are the horse's hair.
3.4.1.17.8	The head is the hospitality of the sacrifice, the hair is the half of the buttocks.
3.4.1.17.9	In this way he encloses the sacrifice on both sides, when the Asvavalya is the Prastara.
3.4.1.18.1	The two Aikesvas are the supports.
3.4.1.18.2	So that the sacrificial grass and the Prastara do not get mixed up.
3.4.1.18.3	Then he takes all the four-fold portions of clarified butter.
3.4.1.18.4	For there are no subsequent offerings here.
3.4.1.19.1	Having obtained the oblations, he churns the fire.
3.4.1.19.2	The hospitality is the head of the sacrifice.
3.4.1.19.3	They indeed generate him when they churn.
3.4.1.19.4	One is born first with the head.
3.4.1.19.5	He thus generates the sacrifice first with the head itself.
3.4.1.19.6	Agni is all the deities.
3.4.1.19.7	For in Agni all the deities are offered.
3.4.1.19.8	The Atithyas are the head of the sacrifice.
3.4.1.19.9	He thus makes the sacrifice complete with all the deities from the head.
3.4.1.19.10	Therefore he churns the fire.
3.4.1.20.1	He takes up the churning-stick, saying, "Thou art the womb of Agni."
3.4.1.20.2	For here Agni is born.
3.4.1.20.3	Therefore he says, "Thou art Agni's womb."
3.4.1.21.1	Then he places the two darbha-blades, saying, "They are the testicles."
3.4.1.21.2	They are just as long as these two are to the woman.
3.4.1.22.1	Then he places the lower kindling-stick, saying, "Thou art Urvashi."
3.4.1.22.2	Then he touches the upper kindling-stick with ghee, saying, "You are life."
3.4.1.22.3	He places it down, saying, "Pururava are you."
3.4.1.22.4	Urvashi is the Apsara.
3.4.1.22.5	Purūravas is the husband.
3.4.1.22.6	And what was born from that pair, that was life.
3.4.1.22.7	In the same way, he generates the sacrifice from this pair.
3.4.1.22.8	Then he says, "Recite for Agni being churned."
3.4.1.23.1	He churns, saying, "I churn you with the Gayatri metre, I churn you with the Tristubh metre, I churn with the Jagati metre."
3.4.1.23.2	He churns it with the metres.
3.4.1.23.3	He recites the metres to the churning (of the fire).
3.4.1.23.4	He thus extends the sacrifice with the metres, as the rays extend the sun.
3.4.1.23.5	He says, "Recite to the born" when it is born. He says, "To the carried away" when he is carrying it away.
3.4.1.24.1-2	He strikes them with the formula, "Be ye both of one mind, of one heart, of one soul, of one intention, of one desire, of one breath, of one speech, of one light, of one lustre, of one form, of one appearance, of one name, of one clan, of one birth, of one lineage, of one origin, of one body, of one shadow, of one life, of one death, of one life span, of one age, of one name. Be ye both of one intention, be ye both of one desire, be ye both without enmity, be ye both not harming each other, be ye both harmless, be ye both free from disease, be ye both healthy, be ye both happy, be ye both fortunate, be ye both prosperous, be ye both well-being, be ye both auspicious, be ye both good, be ye both beneficent, be ye both benign, be ye both friendly, be ye both kind, be ye both gentle, be ye both peaceful, be ye both pleasant, be ye both agreeable, be ye both amiable, be ye both dear, be ye both beloved, be ye both pleasing, be ye both delightful, be ye both gracious, be ye both charming, be ye both beautiful, be ye both handsome, be ye both worthy of worship, be ye both worshipped,
3.4.1.25.1	Then, having sprinkled the clarified butter with the ladle, he offers it to Agni with the verse, "Agni moves in Agni, entered by the son of the sages, the remover of curses. May he, the auspicious, the well-adorner, offer here the oblation to the gods, always without being consumed. Svāhā."
3.4.1.25.2	He generated him with this oblation.
3.4.1.25.3	He sent him with this oblatioin.
3.4.1.26.7	Therefore it is with the Iḍā.
3.4.1.26.8	They do not offer the Anuyājas.
3.4.2.1.1	Having performed the Atithya, the gods found them.
3.4.2.1.2	They fled in four directions, standing in each other's glory.
3.4.2.1.3	Agni with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras, Varuna with the Adityas, Indra with the Maruts, Brihaspati with the Visve Devas. So say some.
3.4.2.1.4	These indeed are those Visve Devas who went forth in four directions.
3.4.2.1.5	The Asuras and Rakshasas followed them as they went forth.
3.4.2.2.1	They knew that they had become worse.
3.4.2.2.2	May the Asuras and Rakshasas not follow us.
3.4.2.2.3	We shall be deprived of our enemies.
3.4.2.2.4	We shall destroy them.
3.4.2.2.5	We shall stand for the prosperity of one (person).
3.4.2.2.6	They stood for the prosperity of Indra.
3.4.2.2.7	Therefore they say, 'Indra is all the deities.'
3.4.2.2.8	'The gods are headed by Indra.'
3.4.2.3.1	Therefore they should not be disregarded.
3.4.2.3.2	He who is the most distant from them, he goes after them.
3.4.2.3.3	They make the beloved ones of their enemies.
3.4.2.3.4	They are given to their enemies.
3.4.2.3.5	Therefore one should not dance.
3.4.2.3.6	He who, knowing this, dances, makes the beloved ones of his enemies.
3.4.2.3.7	He is not given to his enemies.
3.4.2.3.8	Therefore he should dance.
3.4.2.4.1	They said, "Let us do this so that this does not become imperishable."
3.4.2.5.1	The gods, the beloved, the agreeable, the agreeable, came together with the body.
3.4.2.5.2	They said, "By this he will not be different from us. By this he will be everywhere. He who does not transgress this."
3.4.2.5.3	Whose is the one to be seen?
3.4.2.5.4	Tanunaptra is indeed the same as Sakvara.
3.4.2.5.5	He who is this Tanunaptra, Sakvara, is the observer of creatures. He has entered these two, the prāṇa and udāna.
3.4.2.6.1	Therefore they say, "The gods do not know the mind of a human being."
3.4.2.6.2	He resolves with the mind.
3.4.2.6.3	That becomes the prāṇa. Prāṇa becomes wind.
3.4.2.6.4	The wind tells the gods what is in the mind of a man.
3.4.2.7.1	Therefore this was said by the sage: "He resolves with his mind."
3.4.2.7.2	It goes to the wind.
3.4.2.7.3	The wind tells the gods: "This is your mind, O man."
3.4.2.8.1	The gods, the beloved ones, the agreeable abodes, spoke together.
3.4.2.8.2	They said, "By this he will not be different from us. By this he will not go beyond us."
3.4.2.8.3	Even now the gods do not transgress that.
3.4.2.8.4	Who would be (different) if they were to transgress?
3.4.2.8.5	They would speak untruth.
3.4.2.8.6	The gods indeed observe one vow, namely truth.
3.4.2.8.7	Therefore their victory is invincible.
3.4.2.8.8	Therefore, he who knows this, and speaks the truth, has such fame, which is not to be conquered.
3.4.2.8.9	This is the origin of Tanu-naptr.
3.4.2.9.1	Those gods, being pleased, agreed together on the dear abodes of their own bodies.
3.4.2.9.2	And those who take the Azya libations, they also, being pleased, agree together on the dear abode of their own bodies.
3.4.2.9.3	Therefore, one should not approach him with all (his) strength, lest his dear and beloved forms should approach him together.
3.4.2.9.4	With whomsoever one approaches, one should not injure him.
3.4.2.9.5	For they say, "One should not injure the one who is devoted to the Satans."
3.4.2.10.1	Then he takes it with the words, "For Apatya and Parapatya I take thee."
3.4.2.10.2	He who is flowing here, he flows both towards and around.
3.4.2.10.3	For him he takes it.
3.4.2.10.4	Therefore he says, "For Apatyā and Parapatya, I take thee." "
3.4.2.11.1	To Tanunaptra and Shakra."
3.4.2.11.2	He who flows here, he is Tanunaptra Shakra.
3.4.2.14.2	The gods were not to be overcome, not to be injured, being together, speaking the same thing, having the same intention.
3.4.2.14.3	The gods' strength.
3.4.2.14.4	The gods are the most agreeable forms, the most agreeable abodes.
3.4.2.14.5	The one who is not cursed is the protector of the cursed, the one who is not to be cursed.
3.4.2.14.6	For the gods have overcome all curses.
3.4.2.14.7	"I have approached the truth directly." He says this, meaning, "I have transgressed this falsehood."
3.4.2.14.8	"May you protect me."
3.4.2.14.9	For the gods protected themselves when they spoke the truth and did what was true.
3.4.2.14.10	Therefore he says, "May you protect me.
3.4.2.15.1	Then those gods, the beloved forms of the gods, the agreeable abodes, came together. They entrusted it to Indra.
3.4.2.15.2	This indeed is Indra, who shines yonder.
3.4.2.15.3	He did not shine before.
3.4.2.15.4	As this is black, so was he.
3.4.2.15.5	By that very power he shines.
3.4.2.15.6-9	Therefore, if many are to be initiated, the householder should give the vow after sprinkling it. For he is the recipient of Indra's share. If one is to be initiated with Dakshina, they should give the vow to the sacrificer after sprinkling it. For this is said: "Indra is the sacrificer."
3.4.2.16.1	Then those deities, the beloved forms of the gods, the agreeable abodes, united together. That which they united together became the Sama.
3.4.2.16.2	Therefore they say, "The Sama is the truth, the divine Sama."
3.4.3.1.1	The gods, having worshipped with hospitality, found them.
3.4.3.1.2	They were appeased by the Tanunaptras.
3.4.3.1.3	They wanted to perform the expiation for the sin that they had committed against each other.
3.4.3.1.4	They did not perform the initiation again after the first one.
3.4.3.1.5	They saw this intermediate initiation.
3.4.3.2.1	They removed the skin with fire.
3.4.3.2.2	Fire is austerity.
3.4.3.2.3	Initiation is austerity.
3.4.3.2.4	They performed this intermediate initiation.
3.4.3.2.5	Now, that he performs the intermediate consecration, therefore it is called the intermediate consecration.
3.4.3.2.6	He should move the fingers in between.
3.4.3.2.7	He should put on the girdle belt in between. He puts on the girdle belt as it is.
3.4.3.2.8	In the same way, if one does something improper or speaks something improper before this, then this is the atonement for that.
3.4.3.3.1	He removes the skin with fire.
3.4.3.3.2	Fire is austerity.
3.4.3.3.3	Austerity is consecration.
3.4.3.3.4	He approaches the intermediate consecration.
3.4.3.3.5	He puts on the fingers.
3.4.3.3.6	He puts the girdle round her, as it is, when she is true.
3.4.3.3.7	The gods indeed approached offspring.
3.4.3.4.1	They remove the skin with fire.
3.4.3.4.2	Fire is the creator and procreator of the pair.
3.4.3.4.3	They approached the offspring.
3.4.3.4.4	They put on the fingers, the girdle, one by one.
3.4.3.4.5	They made the offspring their own.
3.4.3.4.6	In the same way, he approaches the offspring.
3.4.3.5.1	He removes the skin with fire.
3.4.3.5.2	Agni is the creator and procreator of the pair.
3.4.3.5.3	He approaches the offspring.
3.4.3.5.4	He makes the fingers and the girdle interlaced.
3.4.3.5.5	He makes offspring in himself.
3.4.3.6.1	Now, when the gods were consecrated, he who let go the kindling-wood or the recitation, they sought to injure him with the form of the other, and the other with the form of that.
3.4.3.6.2	They said, "He who speaks evil, let him approach." "You did not wish me ill, you did not intend to harm me."
3.4.3.6.3	Indeed, Agni alone spoke thus, not another. Agni alone spoke thus.
3.4.3.7.1	They said, "You spoke thus to us, O Agni."
3.4.3.7.2	"I did not speak to another, nor did another speak to me."
3.4.3.8.1	They knew, "This one indeed is our protector from darkness.
3.4.3.8.2	This is the form of that (fire).
3.4.3.8.3	With that we shall overcome the Rakshas.
3.4.3.8.4	With that we will attain the heavenly world."
3.4.3.8.5	They became Agni himself.
3.4.3.8.6	With that they overcame the Rakshas,
3.4.3.8.7	and attained the heavenly world.
3.4.3.8.8	In the same way, this becomes the form of Agni.
3.4.3.8.9	With that he overcomes the Rakshas,
3.4.3.8.10	By that he attains the heavenly world.
3.4.3.8.11	He places the kindling wood, approaching the intermediate consecration.
3.4.3.9.1	He places it, saying, "O Agni, the guardian of vows, I am the guardian of vows."
3.4.3.9.2	For Agni is the guardian of vows among the gods.
3.4.3.9.3	Therefore he says, "O Agni the guardian of vows I am the guardian."
3.4.3.9.4	This body of yours is in me, and my body is in yours. Together with you, O Lord of vows, are the vows. Thus he exchanges skins with Agni.
3.4.3.9.5	"May the Lord of Initiation approve of my initiation, and the Lord of Tapas of my Tapas." Thus he approaches the intermediate initiation.
3.4.3.9.6	He stretches out his fingers in between.
3.4.3.11.3	The Vajra is the clarified butter.
3.4.3.11.4	The semen is Soma.
3.4.3.11.5	"One should not injure the semen with the Vajra and clarified butter."
3.4.3.11.6	Therefore, having touched the Madanti (cups), they nourish the king.
3.4.3.12.1	They say, "Since this nourishment is done, one should first nourish the guest Soma, then the Antaradīkṣā, then the Tānūnaptrāṇi."
3.4.3.12.2	One should not do it like that.
3.4.3.12.3	The sacrifice is indeed such an act.
3.4.3.12.4	Here he found them in agreement.
3.4.3.12.5	They first performed the Saman, then the Antaradīkṣā, and then the Apāyana.
3.4.3.13.1	When they perform the Apāyana,
3.4.3.13.2	Soma is indeed a god.
3.4.3.13.3	For Soma is in heaven.
3.4.3.13.4	Soma was indeed Vritra.
3.4.3.13.5	His body is the mountains and the rocks.
3.4.3.13.6	Śvetaketu Auddālaka said, "This is the herb called Śānā."
3.4.3.13.7	Having brought that, they sprinkle it.
3.4.3.13.8	They make Soma grow with the consecration, the Upasads, the Tānūnaptrīya, and the Apāyanīya rites.
3.4.3.13.9	In the same way, he makes the Soma-juice grow by means of the consecration, the Upasads, the Tānūnaptrī verses and the Apāyanā verses.
3.4.3.14.1	They say, "The sacrifice is indeed the sweet and the honey."
3.4.3.14.2	The sacrifice is indeed sweet and honey.
3.4.3.14.3	And these very Rtu-officiating priests are the makers of honey.
3.4.3.14.4	Just as honey is made to grow by the honey-maker, so they make this sacrifice grow.
3.4.3.15.1	By means of sacrifice the gods won this victory, which is theirs.
3.4.3.15.2	They said: How can this (victory) be inaccessible to men?
3.4.3.15.3	Having drunk the essence of the sacrifice, they became hidden like honey-makers who have drunk honey. Having milked the sacrifice with the sacrificial post, they became hidden.
3.4.3.15.4	And because he milked it with this (post), therefore it is called 'yūpa'.
3.4.3.16.1	This was heard by the sages.
3.4.3.16.2	They brought together the sacrifice.
3.4.3.16.3	Just as this sacrifice is brought together, so also he who consecrates himself brings together the sacrifice.
3.4.3.16.4	Speech is the sacrifice.
3.4.3.16.5	What of the sacrifice has been spilled or poured out, that it again fills up.
3.4.3.17.1	They fill it up by becoming six.
3.4.3.17.2	There are six seasons.
3.4.3.17.3	They fill up by becoming the seasons.
3.4.3.18.1	They say, "May the Anśu Anśu, the divine Soma, be filled up."
3.4.3.18.2	They make it grow with each of its rays.
3.4.3.18.3	"To Indra, the knower of one wealth."
3.4.3.18.4	Indra is the deity of the sacrifice.
3.4.3.18.5	Therefore he says, "To Indra" and "the knower of onewealth."
3.4.3.18.6	Each ray of him indeed makes the gods grow by hundreds or by tens.
3.4.3.18.7	"May Indra grow for you; may you grow for Indra."
3.4.3.18.8	Indra is the deity of the sacrifice.
3.4.3.18.9	He thus nourishes the very deity of the sacrifice itself.
3.4.3.18.10	"He says, "Do thou swell for Indra."
3.4.3.18.11	He thus places nourishment in him.
3.4.3.18.12	"Nourish us, our friends, for the sacrifice."
3.4.3.18.13	What he nourishes, that he says; what he nourishes, he says.
3.4.3.18.14	Then whatever he recites, that he says. "He says, "For the wise one..."
3.4.3.18.15	"He says, "May there be well-being for you, O Soma, as you go to the Soma-pressing."
3.4.3.18.16	There is only one blessing among these, of the priests and the sacrificer: 'May we reach the goal of the sacrifice.'
3.4.3.18.17	He says this, 'May we reach to the goal of the Sacrifice.'
3.4.3.19.1	Then they sprinkle on the stone.
3.4.3.19.2	The sacrifice is on the northern side.
3.4.3.19.3	They then pour it on the southern side.
3.4.3.19.4	The sacrifice is Agni.
3.4.3.19.5	They make the sacrifice at the back.
3.4.3.19.6	They do it wrongly.
3.4.3.19.7	They are excluded from the gods.
3.4.3.19.8	The sacrificial grass is the sacrifice.
3.4.3.19.9	They begin the sacrifice again.
3.4.3.19.10	This is the atonement for that.
3.4.3.19.11	Thus indeed, their (sacrifices) are not done in vain.
3.4.3.19.12	They are not excluded from the gods.
3.4.3.19.13	Therefore they offer on a stone.
3.4.3.20.1	They say, "One should offer on a stone, not on an unstoned (place)."
3.4.3.20.2	One should offer on an unstonned (place).
3.4.3.20.3	For the stoning is the offering.
3.4.3.21.1	They praise the desired wealth, the gift, for Bhaga, for truth, to those who speak truth.
3.4.3.21.2	This means: "Truth to those who speak the truth."
3.4.3.21.3	"Salutation to heaven and earth," thus they praise heaven and earth, on which all this is.
3.4.3.22.1	Then, having covered the fire-places, they go to the river saying, "The fires are drinking."
3.4.3.22.2	The Agni-bearer says, "They are drinking."
3.4.3.22.3	"Come with them."
3.4.3.22.4	He carries the fire above and above.
3.4.3.22.5	If he does not carry it further, then he will perform the remaining days with this (fire).
3.4.3.22.6	Now, when he carries the fire upwards, that becomes his receptacle for the offering.
3.4.3.22.7	He gives it to the Agnidhra.
3.4.3.22.8	He places it in the Agnidhriya fire.
3.4.4.1.1	The Upasads are the neck of the sacrifice, the Pravargya is the head.
3.4.4.1.2	Therefore, if there is a Pravargya, they perform with the Pravargya and then with the Upasads.
3.4.4.1.3	He puts the necks back.
3.4.4.2.1	Those which are the formulas in the morning, they are the offerings in the afternoon; those which are the offerings, they are the formulas.
3.4.4.2.2	He separates them.
3.4.4.2.3	Therefore the joints of these necks are separated, and these bones.
3.4.4.3.1	The gods and the Asuras, both of whom were Prajapati's sons, struggled.
3.4.4.4.6	Therefore they say, "One wins the city by means of the Upasads."
3.4.4.4.7	By means of the Upads they win this human city.
3.4.4.5.1	By means of these Upasads the gods broke the cities and conquered these worlds.
3.4.4.5.2	So does he do it.
3.4.4.5.3	No one here in this world makes a city for him.
3.4.4.5.4	He thus breaks up these worlds.
3.4.4.5.5	He conquers these worlds.
3.4.4.5.6	Therefore he performs the Upasads.
3.4.4.6.1	They are offered with ghee as oblation.
3.4.4.6.2	Ghee is the thunderbolt.
3.4.4.6.3	By this thunderbolt, by this ghee, the gods broke through the front and conquered these worlds.
3.4.4.6.4	In the same way, with this thunderbolt of clarified butter, he conquers and wins these worlds.
3.4.4.6.5	Therefore, they are offerings of clarified butter.
3.4.4.7.1	He takes it four times in the ladle and eight times in the Upabhṛt.
3.4.4.7.2	Some say otherwise: "One should take it four times in ladle and eight times into the Upabhृt."
3.4.4.8.1	He takes eight portions in the Juhu and four in the Upamant.
3.4.4.8.2	He makes it a thunderbolt, a crushing stone.
3.4.4.8.3	With that thunderbolt, that crushing stone, he breaks these worlds, conquers these worlds.
3.4.4.9.1	Agni and Soma are the united gods.
3.4.4.9.2	He takes them together with them for Vishnu alone.
3.4.4.10.4	Having sat down, he causes (the sacrificer) to be born.
3.4.4.10.5	The Adhvaryu, having been born, takes up the two ladles.
3.4.4.11.1	He says, "Do thou go beyond and recite the Yajus to Agni."
3.4.4.11.2	Having announced, he says, "Do ye offer to Agni."
3.4.4.11.3	He offers at the Vasat-utterance.
3.4.4.12.1	Then he says, "Recite the Yajus for Soma."
3.4.4.12.2	Having announced he says, "Offer to Soma."
3.4.4.12.3	He offers when the Vasat is uttered.
3.4.4.13.1	Then when the Upamantri pours out the ghee, he says, "Recite to Vishnu."
3.4.4.13.2	Having called out, he says, “Recite to Vishnu.”
3.4.4.13.3	He offers at the Vaṣaṭ-call.
3.4.4.14.1	When he offers while standing in the same place, it is not as if he is moving around. He says, "Victory to the victorious."
3.4.4.14.2	Now, when he offers to these deities, he makes the thunderbolt, Agni the army, Soma the arrow, Vishnu the shield.
3.4.4.15.1	For the thunderbolt is the year.
3.4.4.15.2	Agni is the day.
3.4.4.15.3	Soma is the night.
3.4.4.15.4	And what is between them is Vishnu.
3.4.4.15.5	This indeed makes the year move around.
3.4.4.16.1	The thunderbolt is the year.
3.4.4.16.2	By this very (rite) the gods, with the year as their thunderbolt, broke through the worlds in front and conquered them.
3.4.4.16.3	In the same way this one, with this year as his thunderbolt, breaks through these worlds and conquers them.
3.4.4.16.4	Therefore he offers to these deities.
3.4.4.17.1	He should perform three Upasads.
3.4.4.17.2	There are three seasons in the year.
3.4.4.19.2	The year has twelve months.
3.4.4.19.3	It is the form of the year that is made.
3.4.4.19.4	He makes the year complete.
3.4.4.19.5	He moves twice with one (verse), twice with one.
3.4.4.20.1	They become twenty-four.
3.4.4.20.2	There are twenty-four half-months in a year.
3.4.4.20.3	It is indeed the form of the Year that is made.
3.4.4.20.4	He thus makes it (the year) complete.
3.4.4.21.1	He moves in the evening and morning, for thus indeed does success succeed.
3.4.4.21.2	When he moves in the forenoon, he conquers.
3.4.4.21.3	And when he moves in the afternoon, he has conquered well.
3.4.4.21.4	And when one offers, they fight for this city.
3.4.4.21.5	Having conquered it, they resort to their own city.
3.4.4.22.1	When he moves forward, he fights.
3.4.4.22.2	When he stands still, he conquers.
3.4.4.22.3	When he offers, he resorts to his own true self.
3.4.4.23.1	He offers with the verse, "O Agni, the form that is made of iron, the best, the most hidden, the fierce speech you have removed, the bright speech you have removed. Svāhā!"
3.4.4.23.2	For such was she.
3.4.4.23.3	For she was made of iron.
3.4.4.24.1	Then he offers with, "That which is thy form, O Agni, lying in the dust, the most excellent, the most hidden, the fierce speech thou hast removed, the bright speech thou hast removed. Svāhā!"
3.4.4.24.2	For such was she. 
3.4.4.24.3	For she was of silver.
3.4.4.25.1-4	Then he offers with, "O Agni, that form of thine which is tawny and most excellent, thou hast removed the fierce word, thou hast removed thy bright word, svāhā." For such was she. For she was tawny.
3.4.4.26.1	Now, then, about the Vratopasads.
3.4.4.26.2	Some Upasads are of the Parourvi type, others are of the Parahvi type.
3.4.4.26.3	Those of which one is milked on the first day, then two, then three, are of the Paraurvi type.
3.4.4.26.4	And those of which three are milked on thefirst day, then two and then one, are of the Parahivi type.
3.4.4.26.5	The Parahvi ones are the Paraurvi ones.
3.4.4.26.6	Those who are the Parahvis, they are the Parahvi.
3.4.4.27.1	They conquer the world by Tapas.
3.4.4.27.2	This is his supreme and highest Tapas.
3.4.4.27.3	He conquers the supreme and highest world.
3.4.4.27.4	He who, knowing this, approaches the Parahvi Upasads, becomes the most prosperous in this world.
3.4.4.27.5	Therefore one should approach the Parahvi upasads.
3.4.4.27.6	If one were to perform the twelve-day Upasads, one should milk three, four, two and one (cows) for four days.
3.5.1.1.1	That which is the most excellent of the two, the foremost, the king of the pillars, from that one proceeds towards the east, taking three steps.
3.5.1.1.2	He strikes the peg.
3.5.1.1.3	That is the boundary.
3.5.1.2.1	From the middle peg, he moves forward fifteen steps towards the south.
3.5.1.2.2	He strikes that peg.
3.5.1.2.3	That is the southern hip.
3.5.1.3.1	From the middle peg, one moves forward fifteen steps to the north.
3.5.1.3.2	He strikes the peg.
3.5.1.3.3	That northern hip.
3.5.1.4.1	From the middle peg, he moves forward sixty-three steps towards the east.
3.5.1.4.2	He strikes that peg.
3.5.1.4.3	That is the eastern shoulder.
3.5.1.5.1	From the middle peg, moving towards the south, he moves twelve steps.
3.5.1.5.2	He strikes the peg.
3.5.1.5.3	That constitutes the southern shoulder.
3.5.1.6.1	From that middle peg, moving to the north, he moves twelve paces.
3.5.1.6.2	He destroys that stake.
3.5.1.6.3	That is the upper shoulder.
3.5.1.6.4	This is the measure of the Veda.
3.5.1.7.1	Now, what is thirty paces behind?
3.5.1.7.2	The Viraj has thirty syllables.
3.5.1.7.3	The gods stood firm in this world with Viraj.
3.5.1.7.4	In the same way, he stands firm in this world.
3.5.1.8.1	Or else they may be thirty-three.
3.5.1.8.2	The Viraj has thirty-three syllables.
3.5.1.8.3	He indeed stands firm in this world by the Viraj.
3.5.1.9.1	And why the eastern (line) has thirty-six steps,
3.5.1.9.2	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
3.5.1.9.3	By the Brihatī the gods attained the heavenly world.
3.5.1.9.4	In the same way, he attains heaven by means of the Brihatī.
3.5.1.9.5	This becomes his heavenly Āhavanīya fire.
3.5.1.10.1	And why there are twenty-four steps in front,
3.5.1.10.2	because the Gāyatrī has twenty-four syllables.
3.5.1.10.3	The Gāyatrī is the first half of the sacrifice.
3.5.1.10.4	This is the first half (of the sacrifice).
3.5.1.10.5	Therefore, the twenty-fourfold measure is in front.
3.5.1.10.6	This is the measure of the Veda.
3.5.1.11.1	Now, what is greater behind?
3.5.1.11.2	Behind, they praise a woman as "great-hipped."
3.5.1.11.3	In that what is greater behind, it makes procreation greater behind.
3.5.1.11.4	Therefore, the later and superior progeny is born from it.
3.5.1.12.1	Indeed, the northern altar is the nose of the sacrifice.
3.5.1.12.2	And because he spreads it north of the altar, therefore it is called the northern altar.
3.5.1.13.1	Indeed, in the beginning, there were two kinds of beings: the Adityas and the Angirasas.
3.5.1.13.2	Then the Angirasas performed the sacrifice first.
3.5.1.13.3	Having prepared the sacrifice, they said to Agni, "Tell us tomorrow's Soma-sacrifice to the Adityas."
3.5.1.13.4	"He will perform this sacrifice for us."
3.5.1.14.1	The Adityas said, "Know that the Angiras will perform the sacrifice for us, not the Angiras."
3.5.1.15.1	They said, "There is no departure from the sacrifice by anyone else.
3.5.1.15.2	"We shall hold the Sutiya sacrifice in between."
3.5.1.15.3	They prepared the sacrifice.
3.5.1.15.4	Having prepared the sacrifice, they said, "Tomorrow, O Agni, you have told us about the Sutiya.
3.5.1.15.5	Now we ourselves tell you about the Adyasutiya and the Angiras.
3.5.1.15.6	You be our Hotṛ."
3.5.1.16.1	They were angry with him, and the Angirasas went to Agni.
3.5.1.16.2	They said to him, "How is it that you did not receive our messenger when he came?"
3.5.1.17.1	He said, "They offered to me without censure."
3.5.1.17.2	He was surrounded by those who were without censure, and was unable to go away.
3.5.1.17.3	Therefore, one should not leave the place of Anindya.
3.5.1.17.4	They performed the sacrifice for the Adityas with this (rite).
3.5.1.17.5	It is called 'Sadyaskri'.
3.5.1.18.1	They brought speech as Dakshina.
3.5.1.18.2	They did not accept it, saying, "We will laugh if we accept it."
3.5.1.18.3	That part of the sacrifice which was Dakshina was not completed.
3.5.1.19.1	Then he brought the Sun as the Dakṣiṇā.
3.5.1.19.2	They accepted it.
3.5.1.19.3	Therefore, the Angiras said, "We are the ones who are worthy of Dakṣiṇās, we are the ones who deserve Dakṣiṇas.
3.5.1.19.4	Or, this one who shines is accepted by us."
3.5.1.19.5	Therefore, a white horse is the Dakṣiṇa to be given immediately.
3.5.1.20.1	His golden (image) is in front.
3.5.1.20.2	This is the form of him who shines.
3.5.1.20.3	If one does not find a white horse, then a white cow should be there.
3.5.1.20.4	His golden (image) should be in front.
3.5.1.20.5	That is the form of the one who shines.
3.5.1.21.1	From them indeed speech became angry, saying, "By whom is this kinsman of mine better?"
3.5.1.21.2	By whom was this taken from me? Not by me.'
3.5.1.21.3	She then fled from them.
3.5.1.21.4	She, having become a lioness, took it and wandered between the gods and the Asuras, who were engaged in battle.
3.5.1.21.5	The gods approached her and said, 'The gods are approaching.' The Asuras said, 'The Asuras are approaching.'
3.5.1.21.6	Agni alone was the messenger of the gods, with protection. The Asuras had the Asura Rakshas.
3.5.1.22.1	She was about to turn away from the gods, when she said: "What will happen to me if I turn away?"
3.5.1.22.2	"The first offering to Agni will reach you."
3.5.1.22.3	Then she said to the gods: "Whatever blessing you may wish for me, it will all be accomplished for you."
3.5.1.22.4	She thus turned back to the gods.
3.5.1.23.1	When he spreads the Uttaravedi around the fire which is being carried, it is because the gods had said to her, "The first oblation will reach you." It is thus that she reaches the first oblation of the fire.
3.5.1.23.2	This is the origin of speech.
3.5.1.23.3	And when he spreads the Uttaravedi, it is for the completeness of the sacrifice.
3.5.1.23.4	Speech is indeed the sacrifice.
3.5.1.23.5	For speech is indeed this (earth).
3.5.1.24.1	He measures it with a yoke and a halter, with the yoke where they draw (the cart), with the halter from where they draw.
3.5.1.24.2	With a yoke and ahalter they yoke what is yokeable.
3.5.1.24.3	She, having become a lioness, moved about peacefully. He yokes her here at the sacrifice with that very thing.
3.5.1.25.1	Therefore, one should not accept a gift from one who has turned away from the right (path).
3.5.1.25.2	One who has become a lioness harms him.
3.5.1.25.3	One should not do anything to him.
3.5.1.25.4	One who has becomes a lioness harms her.
3.5.1.25.5	One should give nothing to him.
3.5.1.25.6	He would make the sacrifice other than himself.
3.5.1.25.7	Therefore, he should give her to one who is like a sinner to her, even if he is a relative.
3.5.1.25.8	When he gives her, she does not harm him by becoming a lioness.
3.5.1.25.9	When he offers her to a relative, he does not make her for anyone else but himself.
3.5.1.25.10	This is the establishment for the Dakṣiṇā that has been turned back.
3.5.1.26.1	Then he takes up the dice and the wooden sword.
3.5.1.27.2	He draws around it with the formula, "Thou art the heated one."
3.5.1.27.3	He addresses this (earth) itself.
3.5.1.27.4	For it is heated here.
3.5.1.28.1	Then he places the eastern and northern chips.
3.5.1.28.2	He draws around it with, "Thou art that which is scattered."
3.5.1.28.3	He addresses it itself.
3.5.1.28.4	For here it is scattered.
3.5.1.29.1	Then he puts the eastern and southern chips.
3.5.1.31.3	He takes them, taking the names of the fires.
3.5.1.31.4	The gods in the beginning appointed those fires to be the Hotṛ. They fled.
3.5.1.31.5	They approached these very worlds, two of them being here and one beyond.
3.5.1.31.6	He takes them by that very reason.
3.5.1.32.1	He strikes (the fire) with the verse, "O Agni, the sky is your name. O Agni, the name is Angiras. Come with the name."
3.5.1.32.2	When he throws it down, he bestows life. He makes it blow.
3.5.1.32.3	"You who are in this earth," he says. "You who are in the earth," he says, and throws it down. "With your name that is not violated, that is fit for sacrifice, I place you."
3.5.1.32.4-8	"What is not endangered by the Raksases, the name of which is Yajnya, by that I place thee." Thus indeed he says. He takes the fourth one with the verse, "The gods follow thee." "I take thee for the gods, for what is agreeable to them," thus indeed he says. (He takes it) from the Catvāla with four furrows. There are four directions.
3.5.1.32.9	He thus takes her away from all directions.
3.5.1.33.1	Then he arranges her, saying, "Thou art the lioness, the conqueror of foes; be thou for the gods."
3.5.1.33.2	In that she, having become a lioness, moved about peacefully, he says to her, "Thou art a lioness."
3.5.1.33.3	"Thou art the conqueror of foes," he says, "May we, through thee, overcome our foes, the evil ones."
3.5.1.33.4	"May it be suitable for the gods."
3.5.1.33.5	The woman is the northern altar.
3.5.1.33.6	He makes it suitable for the gods.
3.5.1.34.1	He makes her a cubit in size all around, or ten steps for the sacrificer.
3.5.1.34.2	The Viraj has ten syllables.
3.5.1.34.3	Speech is Viraj.
3.5.1.34.4	Speech is the sacrifice.
3.5.1.34.5	He makes the middle like the navel, so that one may sit evenly and pour out."
3.5.1.35.1	She sprinkles it with water.
3.5.1.35.2	She (the earth) having become a lioness, moves about as if pacified. Water is pacifying. With water she pacifies her.
3.5.1.35.3	The Uttaravedi is a woman.
3.5.1.35.4	She offers it to the gods.
3.5.1.35.5	Therefore he sprinkles it with water
3.5.1.36.1	He sprinkles it with the formula, "Thou art a lioness, thou art the slayer of foes. Be purified for the gods."
3.5.1.36.2	Then he sprinkles with sand.
3.5.1.36.3	Sand is indeed an ornament.
3.5.1.36.4	For sand shines like fire.
3.5.1.36.5	Sand is the ashes of the fire of Agni Vaiśvānara.
3.5.1.36.6	One is about to install fire in it.
3.5.1.36.7	Thus Agni does not harm it.
3.5.1.36.8	Therefore he sprinkles with sand.
3.5.1.36.9	He scatters it, saying, "Thou art a lion, thou art the slayer of enemies. Shine for the gods."
3.5.1.36.10	Then he covers it.
3.5.1.36.11	She dwells in that covered (place) during the night.
3.5.2.1.1	They put on the wood.
3.5.2.1.2	They prepare the Upāmuṇya (sticks).
3.5.2.1.3	He puts down the clarified butter.
3.5.2.1.4	He cleanses the spoon and the ladle.
3.5.2.1.5	Then he takes up the clarified butter with five spoonfuls when the kindling wood has caught fire.
3.5.2.2.1	Then they take up the kindling wood.
3.5.2.2.2	They take up the kindlers.
3.5.2.2.3	Then he says, "Recite to Agni being taken away," and "Come with the single-spoonful."
3.5.2.2.4	The Pratiprasthātṛ recites the Anudāsa verse from the middle of the Vedi, from the place where the southern end of the Vedi is.
3.5.2.2.5	That which is cut off by the southern end of Vedi, that he joins together.
3.5.2.3.1	Some recite the Anudāśa verse from the northern end of the Vedi.
3.5.2.3.2	One should not do so.
3.5.2.3.3	From the middle of the altar, one should go to the north.
3.5.2.3.4	They go to the northern altar.
3.5.2.4.1	The Adhvaryu takes up the sprinkling water.
3.5.2.4.2	He sprinkles first, standing towards the north, saying, "May Indraghosha protect you with the Vasus in the east."
3.5.2.4.3	He says, "May Indra-ghosha protect you in the east with the Vasus."
3.5.2.5.1	Then he sprinkles from the west, saying, "May Pracetas protect thee from the west with the Rudras."
3.5.2.5.2	He thereby says, "May Praceta protect thee from the western direction with the Rudras".
3.5.2.6.1	Then he sprinkles from the south, saying, "Manojava may protect thee from the south with the Fathers."
3.5.2.6.2	May the wind, with the Fathers, protect thee from the south. Thus indeed he says.
3.5.2.7.1	Then he sprinkles from the north: May Visvakarman, with the Adityas, protect thee from north.
3.5.2.7.2	May Visvakarman with the Adityus protect thee from the north. Thus indeed he say.
3.5.2.8.1	Now those which are left over after sprinkling, he carries them outside the altar along the southern edge of the two earlier lines, saying, "This is the heat of the water, I am casting out the sacrifices outside."
3.5.2.8.2	She, having become a lioness, moved about as if pacified. He casts out her purity outside the sacrifices. If he does not perform the rite of sorcery,
3.5.2.8.3	If he were to perform a rite of sorcery, he would say, "I am pouring forth the heated water against him."
3.5.2.8.4	He pierces him with this grief.
3.5.2.8.5	He goes to the other world grieving.
3.5.2.9.1	When the fire is being carried, he spreads the northern altar.
3.5.2.9.2	The gods, indeed, said to her, "You will be the first oblation to Agni." She is now the first oblation of Agni.
3.5.2.9.3	Whatever blessing the Goddess has promised to the gods, that blessing the priests and the sacrificer desire for him.
3.5.2.9.4	All that blessing is fulfilled for him.
3.5.2.10.1	When he spreads the northern altar, he does two things in one.
3.5.2.10.2	Now of those two, the one which is like the navel in the middle, of that one, the one which lies to the east,
3.5.2.11.1	on that one he offers the libation with the formula, "Thou art a lion, svāhā."
3.5.2.11.2	Then on the other two, on the northern one, with the formula, “Thou art a lion; thou art the abode of the sun, svāhā.”
3.5.2.11.3	Then on the two others, on the southern one, with the verse, “Thou art the abode of Brahman, thou art the abode for the Kshatra, svāhā.
3.5.2.11.4	There are many blessings in the Yajus.
3.5.2.11.5	It is the Brahman and the Kshatra that are blessed, both of them are heroic.
3.5.2.12.1	Then on the northern side of the eastern ones, one says, "You are a lioness, bestowing good offspring, bestowing prosperity, svāhā."
3.5.2.12.2	When he says, "Bestowing good offspring," he blesses offspring.
3.5.2.12.3	"Bestowing prosperity" means.
3.5.2.12.4	Prosperity is the earth.
3.5.2.12.5	He blesses prosperity.
3.5.2.13.1	Then he offers the middle libation with the formula, "O lion, do thou bring the gods to the sacrificer, svāhā."
3.5.2.13.2	He thus brings the gods to the Sacrificer.
3.5.2.13.3	Then he lifts up the ladle with the formula, “For the Bhūtas (spirits) thee.”
3.5.2.13.4	Bhūtas are progeny.
3.5.2.13.5	He thus says, "For the progeny thee."
3.5.2.14.1-3	Then he lays down the enclosing sticks, with the formulas, "Thou art firm, thou holdest the earth firm." (He lays down) the middle one. "Thou art the holder of the firm, thou holdst the sky firm." (He places) the southern one. "Thou holdest the unmoving, thou holdest heaven firm." (He puts down) the northern one. "Thou are the ashes of Agni." (He places down) the materials. That they are materials, is for the all-pervasiveness of Agni.
3.5.2.15.1	The wood of the Butea frondosa is his body.
3.5.2.15.2	In that the enclosing sticks are of Butea frondosa, he thus makes him whole by means of his body.
3.5.2.16.1	The resin is his flesh.
3.5.2.16.2	In that it is resin, he thus makes it whole by means of its flesh.
3.5.2.17.1	The incense is his fragrance.
3.5.2.17.2	Now, when it is smeared with fragrant unguent, it is by means of fragrance that he thus makes it complete.
3.5.2.18.1	And why there is a horn of a bull.
3.5.2.18.2	For Agni dwelt for one night between the horns of a bull. What was hidden there, that is here also.
3.5.2.18.3	Therefore there is a horn.
3.5.2.18.4	Therefore, one should take the one that is closest to the head, having cut it off.
3.5.2.18.5	If one does not find that one, then one should take any one.
3.5.2.18.6	The reason there are boundaries is for protection.
3.5.2.18.7	The boundaries come from far away, as if from the north.
3.5.3.1.1	The sacrifice is a person.
3.5.3.1.2	The sacrifice becomes a person because a person makes it.
3.5.3.1.3	This is the one who is being stretched out. He is made to be as big as a man.
3.5.3.1.4	Therefore, man is a sacrifice.
3.5.3.2.1	The fire-altar is indeed his head.
3.5.3.2.2	It has Vishnu as its deity.
3.5.3.2.3	And because Soma is in it, Soma is the sacrifice of the gods. Therefore, it is called Havirdhana.
3.5.3.3.1	The fire for offerings is indeed his mouth.
3.5.3.3.2	When he offers on the Ahavaniya, it is as if he were to sprinkle water on his face.
3.5.3.4.1	The sacrificial post is indeed the stupa.
3.5.3.4.2	The Agnidhra and the Marjalyas are indeed his arms.
3.5.3.5.1	The hall is indeed his belly.
3.5.3.5.2	Therefore they eat in the hall.
3.5.3.5.3	For whatever one eats here, all of it indeed stands in the belly.
3.5.3.5.4	Now, because the All-gods sat down in him, therefore it is called the Sadas.
3.5.3.5.5	And these Brahmanas of all castes sit down in him.
3.5.3.6.1	And these two fires are his feet at the back.
3.5.3.6.2	He is indeed being extended, and he is extended to the size of a man.
3.5.3.6.3	Therefore man is the sacrifice.
3.5.3.7.1	The Havirdhana hall has doors on both sides.
3.5.3.7.2	The Sadas hall has doors on two sides.
3.5.3.7.3	Therefore this man is covered with hair.
3.5.3.7.4	When the Havirdhana hall is covered, he stands up.
3.5.3.8.1	They turn them around, the right one with the right and the left one with the left.
3.5.3.8.2	The younger one should be on the right.
3.5.3.9.1	When they are completed, they place the roof.
3.5.3.9.2	If they do not find a roof, they attach a wall of the same size.
3.5.3.9.3	They build the roof on the ground.
3.5.3.9.4	They place the roof on the raised walls or a wall of the right size.
3.5.3.10.1	Then again taking up the ghee in four spoonfuls, he offers to Savitr for the purpose of propagation.
3.5.3.10.2	Savitr is the propagator of the gods.
3.5.3.10.3	We have created the sacrifice with Savitr's impulse.
3.5.3.10.4	Therefore he offers to Savitri.
3.5.3.11.1	He offers with the verse, "They yoke the mind and they yoke the thought."
3.5.3.11.2	The sacrifice is created with mind and speech.
3.5.3.11.3	When he says, "One yokes the mind," he yokes the mind.
3.5.3.11.4	When he says, "They yoke the thought," he yokes speech.
3.5.3.11.5	For with each thought, men yoke themselves, as if with an unspoken desire, as if with verses.
3.5.3.11.6	With these two yoked, they perform the sacrifice.
3.5.3.12.1	"The seers, the wise, of the great sage,"
3.5.3.12.2	Those Brahmanas who are learned and know the Veda, they are the Brahmanas.
3.5.3.12.3	He addresses them thus:
3.5.3.12.4	"The great sage."
3.5.3.12.5	The sacrifice is the great sage.
3.5.3.12.6	He addresses the sacrifice thus:
3.5.3.12.7	"He has placed the Hotr-ship, the knower of the Yajus, in one."
3.5.3.12.8	They place the Hotr-ships while performing the sacrifice.
3.5.3.12.9	The earth is the praise of the divine Savitr. Svāhā.
3.5.3.12.10	He offers this to Savitr for the sake of progeny.
3.5.3.13.1	Then, having taken another four-spoonful portion of clarified butter, he goes out.
3.5.3.13.2	The wife goes out through the southern door.
3.5.3.13.3	Having placed gold on the southern side of the southern Havirdhāna, he offers with the verse, "This Vishnu strode thrice, he placed his foot in three ways, his foot was firmly planted on the dust. Svāhā."
3.5.3.13.4	He gives the dripping (ghee) to the wife in her hand.
3.5.3.13.5	She anoints the heated part of the ladle and announces to the gods, "The gods have heard."
3.5.3.13.6	The Pratiprasthātṛ gives the Sruva and the Ajyavilāpana to the Pratiprasthātr.
3.5.3.13.7	The two (the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthatṛ) lead the wife with their buttocks towards the fires.
3.5.3.14.1-2	Having taken up the clarified butter four times, the Pratiprasthātṛ, having placed gold on the southern side of the northern Havirdhāna, offers with the verse, "May the two goddesses, the giver of wealth, the giver of milk, the giver of food, the giver of nourishment, the giver of strength, the giver of happiness, the giver of prosperity, the giver of good fortune, the giver of all, the giver of everything, the giver of the world, the giver of heaven, the giver of earth, the giver of water, the giver of plants, the giver of herbs, the giver of fruits, the giver of grains, the giver of seeds, the giver of roots, the giver of leaves, the giver of flowers, the giver of honey, the giver of nectar, the giver of life, the giver of immortality, the giver of light, the giver of radiance, the giver of heat, the giver of warmth, the giver of fire, the giver of smoke, the giver of wind, the giver of rain, the giver of clouds, the giver of lightning, the giver of thunder, the giver of hail, the giver of snow, the giver of dew, the giver of frost, the giver of darkness, the giver of night, the giver of day, the giver of dawn, the giver of twilight, the giver of time, the giver of seasons, the giver of years, the giver of months, the giver of fortnights, the giver of days, the giver of hours, the giver of minutes, the giver of instants, the giver of worlds, the giver of beings, the giver of gods, the giver of men, the giver of cattle, the giver of sheep, the giver of goats, the giver of birds, the giver of trees, the giver of grasses, the giver of shrubs
3.5.3.14.3	He anoints the fire with the oil of the sacrificial ladle, saying, "May the gods proclaim it among the gods."
3.5.3.14.4	When he offers thus,
3.5.3.15.1	the gods, while performing the sacrifice, were afraid of being obstructed by the Asuras and Rakshas.
3.5.3.15.2	The clarified butter is the thunderbolt.
3.5.3.15.3	With this thunderbolt of clarified butter they struck down the Rakshas and Asuras on the right side.
3.5.3.15.4	and they did not follow their path.
3.5.3.15.5	In the same way, with this thunderbolt of ghee, he strikes the evil spirits and Rakshas to the right.
3.5.3.15.6	And they do not follow his path.
3.5.3.15.7	And when he offers with two verses addressed to Vishnu,
3.5.3.15.8	it is because the Havirdhana is indeed connected with Vishnu.
3.5.3.16.1-6	Now when the wife of the sacrificer feels heat, it is indeed generation that is being done. When a woman and a man feel heat, then semen is emitted. From that it is born. He feels heat from afar. From afar semen is emitted. Then he says, "Recite when the Havirdhāna carts are being turned around."
3.5.3.17.1	Or he recites, "The Pracetas, the Adhvaras, are arranging the funeral rite."
3.5.3.17.2	The Adhvaras are indeed the sacrifice.
3.5.3.17.3	He says this, "The Prachetases are arranging the funeral sacrifice."
3.5.3.17.4	"Lead the sacrifice upwards, do not be slow."
3.5.3.17.5	He says this: "Lead this sacrifice upwards to the world of the gods."
3.5.3.17.6	"Do not let your tongue be loose." Thus he wishes for him a long life.
3.5.3.17.7	They should be recited as if they were being recited, so that they are not recited.
3.5.3.17.8	This is the Asurian speech of the Yakshas.
3.5.3.17.9	"Let not the Asurian speech be spoken here."
3.5.3.17.10	If they are recited,
3.5.3.18.1	He should recite this while addressing his own cowshed: "O Goddess, do not let my life be extinguished, do not let the progeny be extinguished."
3.5.3.18.2	This is indeed the atonement for that.
3.5.3.19.1	They say: One should proceed towards the north from the Uttaravedi, taking three steps.
3.5.3.19.2	One should place the sacrificial post there.
3.5.3.19.3	The size of the sacrificial post is the same as the size of the sacrificial posts.
3.5.3.19.4	There is no specific size here.
3.5.3.19.5	Wherever one may think in one's own mind, that is neither too far nor too near. One should place it there.
3.5.3.20.1	He consecrates it with the verse, "May you delight here, O Varṣman, on the earth."
3.5.3.20.2	For this is the Varṣman of the earth.
3.5.3.20.3	For the Ahavanīya is in heaven.
3.5.3.20.4	He places it in the sky.
3.5.3.20.5	For that is the form of prosperity.
3.5.3.21.1	Then, going around on the north, the Adhvaryu places the southern Havirdhana (shed) with the verse, "Which of the powers of Vishnu shall I praise? He who measured the earthly regions, who spread out the upper abode, who, going three times, is the great-throated, to Vishnu thee."
3.5.3.21.2	The one who strikes the Methi (plant) from afar, and what is human.
3.5.3.22.1	Then the Pratiprasthātṛ places the Havirdhāna vessel on the ground, reciting, "O Viṣṇu, from heaven or from earth, from the great or from the sky,
3.5.3.22.2	Both hands are yours, O Viṣṇu. Give wealth from the left and right. To you, O Viṣṇa.
3.5.3.22.3	The Methi plant is placed below, beyond that, whatever is human.
3.5.3.22.4	For the fire-altar is indeed the abode of Vishnu, and they serve it with the Yajus-formulas of Vishnu.
3.5.3.23.1	Then, having touched the middle layer, he recites: "That Vishnu is praised for his valour, like a fierce beast roaming the mountains, whose three strides are the most extensive, and in whose three strides all the worlds are contained."
3.5.3.23.2	This indeed is his head-covering, what is above.
3.5.3.23.3	For other head-coverings are indeed covered by this one.
3.5.3.23.4	Therefore he says, 'They are covered.'
3.5.3.24.1	Having touched the forehead, he recites, 'You are Vishnu's forehead.'
3.5.3.24.2	This indeed is his forehead.
3.5.3.24.3	Then, having touched the Ucchairyya (the wooden ladle), he recites, "You are in Vishnu's ladle."
3.5.3.24.4	These indeed are his two ears.
3.5.3.24.5	Then, the roof that is at the back, that indeed is his head-covering, which is at the back.
3.5.3.25.1	Then, with a needle and thread, he sews, "You are Vishnu's needle."
3.5.3.25.2	Then he makes a knot, saying, "Thou art firm for Vishnu." So that it may not slip off.
3.5.3.25.3	He puts it on the sacrificial post in the prescribed manner.
3.5.3.25.4	If a snake should bite the Adhvaryu or the sacrificer,
3.5.3.25.5	He touches it when it is fixed, saying, "For Vishnu."
3.5.3.25.6	For the Havirdhana is indeed for Vishnu.
3.5.4.1.1	Two are the upper posts which are put up.
3.5.4.1.2	The Havirdhāna is the head of the sacrifice.
3.5.4.1.3	The four holes in the head are these two (holes) and those two (holes). He makes them.
3.5.4.1.4	Therefore he digs them up.
3.5.4.2.1	The gods and the Asuras, both of whom were Prajapati's sons, struggled.
3.5.4.2.2	Then the Asuras dug up the Kṛtyā and Vala stones in these worlds, thinking, "Thus we shall overcome the gods."
3.5.4.3.1	But the gods found out about it.
3.5.4.3.2	They dug up those Kṛtyā stones and Vala stones.
3.5.4.3.3	When they dig up the Kṛtya stones, then the Kṛtya becomes useless and empty.
3.5.4.3.4	In the same way, if someone who is his enemy or rival were to dig up the sacrificial posts and stakes here, he would dig them up again.
3.5.4.3.5	Therefore he digs them up.
3.5.4.3.6	He digs the sacrificial post below the southern Havirdhāna shed.
3.5.4.4.1	He takes up the ladle, saying, "In the impulse of the divine Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, I take thee." "Thou art a woman."
3.5.4.4.2	The bond of this formula is the same.
3.5.4.4.3	The ladle is indeed a woman.
3.5.4.4.4	Therefore he says, "Thou art a female."
3.5.4.5.1	I draw them around, except for a space of a cubit, and cut off the necks of the demons.
3.5.4.5.2	The thunderbolt is the thunderbolt.
3.5.4.5.3	With the thunderbolt he cuts off the necks of demons and fiends.
3.5.4.6.1	He should first draw the southern one of the two eastern ones, then the northern one of the two western ones, then the southern one of those two, then the northern of the two eastern.
3.5.4.7.1-3	Now, they say, one should draw the northern line first of the two lines, then the southern line of the two lines. Then the southern line of those two, then the northern line of those two. Now, one should draw them in the proper way. One should draw the northern one first of the two, then the southern one of the two. Now they say, one may draw the northern line of the two first, then the southern of the two, and then the southern of those two, and then northern of those two. Now, one should draw it in the proper way.
3.5.4.8.1	He digs them as they are written, in the same order, with the formula, "Thou art great, thou art of great power."
3.5.4.8.2	He praises them with this (formula), and magnifies them when he says, "Thou art greater, thou art of greater power."
3.5.4.8.3	"Speak the speech to Indra, the great."
3.5.4.8.4	Indra is indeed the deity of the sacrifice.
3.5.4.8.5	The Havirdhana is connected with Vishnu.
3.5.4.8.6	He makes it connected with Indra.
3.5.4.8.7	Therefore he says, "Speak to Indra the great words."
3.5.4.9.1	"The destroyer of Rakshas, the destroyer of Valgas."
3.5.4.9.2	For these are intended for the destruction of Rakshas and Valgas.
3.5.4.9.3	"The Vaishnavi."
3.5.4.9.4	For the speech in the Havirdhana is Vaishnavi.
3.5.4.10.1	As he dug them, so he throws them up. I throw up this stake which my friend or my enemy has dug up.
3.5.4.10.2	Whether it is a friend or an enemy who digs up the stakes,
3.5.4.10.3	he throws them up.
3.5.4.11.1	I throw up this stake, which my friend or enemy has dug up.
3.5.4.11.2	Whether it is the same or different, one digs up the Kṛtyā-valgas.
3.5.4.11.3	He digs them up.
3.5.4.12.1	"This is the Kṛtyâ-valga that I dig up, which my friend or foe has dug up."
3.5.4.12.2	Whether it is a friend or foe, one digs up Kṛtyā valgas.
3.5.4.12.3	He then digs them up.
3.5.4.14.3	By this he deludes the victim with the end.
3.5.4.14.4	They strike them with the eye.
3.5.4.14.5	If one is unable to do so with the eye, then with the mouth.
3.5.4.14.6	Therefore, these vital airs are struck with the supreme eye.
3.5.4.15.1	He touches them as they are dug out, saying, "Thou art the lord of the self, the slayer of foes; thou art the lord of sacrifice, the slayer of hatred; thou art the people's lord, the slayer of demons; thou art the slayer of all foes."
3.5.4.15.2	This is indeed a blessing for this rite.
3.5.4.15.3	He thus invokes a blessing.
3.5.4.16.1	Then the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer touch each other.
3.5.4.16.2	The Adhvaryu is on the right side of the former (pair), the sacrificer on the left side of the latter.
3.5.4.16.3	The Adhvaryu asks the sacrificer, "What is here?"
3.5.4.16.4	He says, "Good."
3.5.4.16.5	The Adhvaryu says, "Let us do it together."
3.5.4.17.1	The Advaryu is on right side of the latter (pair), the Sacrificer on the left of the former.
3.5.4.17.2	The Adhvaryu asks, "What is here?"
3.5.4.17.3	He replies, "Good."
3.5.4.17.4	The sacrificer says, "So be it."
3.5.4.17.5	When they thus consult together, they make the breaths united.
3.5.4.17.6	Therefore these breaths are united in the highest knowledge.
3.5.4.17.7	And when he replies, "Good," when asked, he speaks a good human word.
3.5.4.17.8	Therefore, when asked, he replies, "Well-being."
3.5.4.17.9	Then he sprinkles (the ground).
3.5.4.17.10	"One is the only relation of sprinkling."
3.5.4.17.11	He makes them pure.
3.5.4.18.1	He sprinkles, saying, "You are the destroyers of Rakshas, the destroyers of Vala."
3.5.4.18.2	They are indeed destroyers of Rakshasa.
3.5.4.18.3	They are indeed the destroyers of Vāla.
3.5.4.18.4	"I sprinkle the Vaishnavas."
3.5.4.18.5	They are Vaishnavas.
3.5.4.19.1	Then he places the remaining sprinkling-water in the holes.
3.5.4.19.2	He thus places the waters which are in the vital airs.
3.5.4.19.3	Therefore these waters are in these vital airs.
3.5.4.20.1	He places them with the formula, "You are the destroyers of Rakshas, the destroyers of Valgas, I place the waters of Vishnu."
3.5.4.20.2	Then he spreads the grass with their tips towards the east and the west.
3.5.4.22.1	Then he puts the two pieces of wood on the yoke, with the formula, "I put down the two Rakṣohana (pieces of wood), the two Valaghanas, the two belonging to Visnu."
3.5.4.22.2	These are indeed his jaws.
3.5.4.22.3	Then he encloses them with the formula, “I enclose the two Rakṣohaṇas, the two Valaghanas, the two belongingto Visnu.”
3.5.4.22.4	He makes them firm and unshakable.
3.5.4.23.1	Then the yoke is completed, all red.
3.5.4.23.2	The tongue is indeed his.
3.5.4.23.3	And because it is all red, for the tongue is indeed reddish.
3.5.4.23.4	He places it down with the formula, "Thou art of Visnu."
3.5.4.23.5	For this indeed belongs to Visnu.
3.5.4.24.1	Then he takes up the gravel.
3.5.4.24.2	The gravel is indeed his teeth.
3.5.4.24.3	And because they sprinkle with gravel, it is as if one were to chew with teeth.
3.5.4.24.4	He places them with the formula, "These are the abode of Visnu."
3.5.4.24.5	For these are indeed the abode of Visņu.
3.5.4.24.6	This is the head of the sacrifice which has been sanctified.
3.6.1.1.1	The assembly hall is indeed its belly.
3.6.1.1.2	Therefore they eat in the assembly hall.
3.6.1.1.3	For whatever is eaten here, all this indeed stands in the belly.
3.6.1.1.4	And because the All-gods sat in it, therefore it is called 'sado'.
3.6.1.1.5	These very Brahmanas of all castes are seated in him.
3.6.1.1.6	It has Indra as its deity.
3.6.1.2.1	In the middle of that he places the Udumbara (wood).
3.6.1.2.2	The Udumbara is food, energy.
3.6.1.2.3	The belly is indeed the hall.
3.6.1.2.4	He places food in the middle of it.
3.6.1.2.5	Therefore he places the Udumvara in the middle.
3.6.1.3.1	Then he goes forward six steps from the middle peg to the right side of the altar.
3.6.1.3.2	He goes seven steps to the south for the sake of prosperity.
3.6.1.3.3	He digs out that hole.
3.6.1.4.1	He takes up the spade, saying, "I take thee with the impulse of the divine Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan. Thou art a woman."
3.6.1.4.2	The binding of this verse is the same.
3.6.1.4.3	The spade is indeed a woman.
3.6.1.4.4	Therefore, she says, "You are a woman."
3.6.1.5.1	Then she draws around the pit, saying, "I am cutting off the necks of the demons."
3.6.1.5.2	The spade is a thunderbolt.
3.6.1.5.3	With the thunderbolt, she cuts off the necks of demons and Rākṣasas.
3.6.1.6.1	Then she digs.
3.6.1.6.2	He lays down the sacrificial grass in the east.
3.6.1.6.3	Having measured with the sacrificer, he lays down the Udumbara-wood.
3.6.1.6.4	He places it with its tip towards the east.
3.6.1.6.5	He places grass of the same size above it.
3.6.1.7.1	Then there are sprinkling-water with barley.
3.6.1.7.2	Water is indeed the juice of plants.
3.6.1.7.3	Therefore, when plants are eaten without being sprinkled, they do not digest.
3.6.1.7.4	The plants are the essence of water.
3.6.1.7.5	Therefore, when drunk, water does not digest alone.
3.6.1.7.6	When both are mixed together, then it digests.
3.6.1.7.7	Then it becomes tasty. One should sprinkle with tasty water."
3.6.1.8.1	The gods and the Asuras, both of whom were born from Prajapati, fought.
3.6.1.8.2	Then all the plants went to the gods.
3.6.1.8.3	The barley-grains were indeed given to them.
3.6.1.9.1	The gods indeed obtained them.
3.6.1.9.2	They obtained all the plants of their enemies by means of these.
3.6.1.9.3	Because they obtained (them), therefore they are called barley.
3.6.1.10.1	They said, "Let us put the juice of all plants in barley."
3.6.1.10.2	The juice of all plants was put into barley.
3.6.1.10.3	Therefore, while other plants wither, these grow and flourish.
3.6.1.10.4	For they put the juice into them.
3.6.1.10.5	In the same way, he puts all the plants of his enemies into them.
3.6.1.10.6	Therefore, the sprinkling is done with barley.
3.6.1.11.1	When he sows the barley, he says, "Thou art barley; may we be prosperous. May our enemies be prosperous."
3.6.1.11.2	There is nothing hidden here.
3.6.1.11.3	Then he sprinkles (the seeds).
3.6.1.11.4	The sprinkling has only one relation.
3.6.1.11.5	He makes it pure.
3.6.1.12.1	He sprinkles, saying, "For thee the heaven, for thee the atmosphere, for thee the earth."
3.6.1.12.2	He thus distributes these worlds with energy and juice.
3.6.1.12.3	He places the strength, the sap, in these worlds.
3.6.1.13.1	Then he puts the remaining sprinkling water into a pit, saying, "May the worlds be purified, the abode of the Fathers."
3.6.1.13.2	The pit dug out is indeed connected with the Fathers and the Gods.
3.6.1.13.3	He makes it fit for sacrifice.
3.6.1.14.1	Then he strews the grass, with the tips pointing east and west, saying, "Thou art the abode of the fathers."
3.6.1.14.2	This is her offering to the Pitrs.
3.6.1.14.3	She is as much within the plants as she is within the plants that are dug out.
3.6.1.15.1	She raises it, saying, "Stand up to heaven, fill the atmosphere, and be firm on earth."
3.6.1.15.2	He thus distributes these worlds with energy and sap.
3.6.1.15.3	He places the sap and juice in these worlds.
3.6.1.16.1	Then he presses it, saying, "May Dyutān, the Maruts, press thee."
3.6.1.16.2	This is the Dyutān, Maruts, who are blowing.
3.6.1.16.3	He presses it with that.
3.6.1.16.4	"May Mitra-Varuna press thee with the firm law."
3.6.1.16.5	Mitra-Varuna are the out-breath and in-breath.
3.6.1.16.6	He presses her with the out-breath, in-breath.
3.6.1.17.1	Then he encloses (the fire) with the formula, "For the sake of Brahman, for the sake of Ksatra, for the sake prosperity I enclose thee."
3.6.1.17.2	There are many blessings in the Yajus.
3.6.1.17.3	It is for the sake of Brahman and Ksatra, both of which are heroic.
3.6.1.17.4	"For the sake of prosperity" means for the sake of the earth.
3.6.1.17.5	It is the earth that is prosperity.
3.6.1.17.6	He thus seeks prosperity.
3.6.1.18.1	Then he recites the verse, "May the Brahman be firm, may the Kshatra be firm, may life be firm, may progeny be firm."
3.6.1.18.2	This is indeed a blessing for this rite.
3.6.1.18.3	He indeed blesses this rite.
3.6.1.18.4	One should perform the Parysarana rite on the same level as the pit or above the pit.
3.6.1.18.5	Then one should do it in the manner of the gods.
3.6.1.18.6	Then indeed the pit becomes so.
3.6.1.19.1	Then one places it below.
3.6.1.19.2	Where they dig up his body, make it rough, and destroy it, water is peace. With water he appeases it, with water he joins it.
3.6.1.19.3	Therefore he carries it away from there.
3.6.1.20.1	Then he recites this verse: "You are firm, this sacrificer is firm. May he be prosperous with offspring in this abode."
3.6.1.20.2	Or: "With cattle."
3.6.1.20.3	Thus whatever desire he desires, that desire is fulfilled for him.
3.6.1.21.1	Then with the ladle, having poured clarified butter, he offers on the fire, saying, "May heaven and earth be filled with clarified butter."
3.6.1.21.2	He thus shares these heaven and earth with energy and juice.
3.6.1.21.3	He places energy and juice in them.
3.6.1.21.4	These creatures live on these, which are full of juice and nourishing.
3.6.1.22.1	Then he lays down the covering-boards, with the formula, "Thou art the covering-board of Indra."
3.6.1.22.2	For the assembly hall is indeed of Indra.
3.6.1.22.3	"The shade of the assembly of all people,"
3.6.1.22.4	For the Brahmanas of all families sit here.
3.6.1.22.5	He lays down the covering boards on both sides, three on the north and three on the south.
3.6.1.22.6	They become nine.
3.6.1.22.7	The sacrifice is threefold.
3.6.1.22.8	Nine is threefold.
3.6.1.22.9	Therefore they become nine.
3.6.1.23.1	The Udicina-family is the Sadas, the Pracina-family is the Havirdhana.
3.6.1.23.2	This is the exclusive property of the gods, namely the Havirdhana;
3.6.1.23.3	therefore they do not eat or consume there.
3.6.1.23.4	For this is the exclusive property for the gods.
3.6.1.23.5	He who would eat or consume there, his head would fall.
3.6.1.23.6	Now, these are the mixed ones: the Agnidhra and the Sadas.
3.6.1.23.7	Therefore they eat from them, therefore they partake of them.
3.6.1.23.8	For these are mixed.
3.6.1.23.9	The direction towards the north is for men.
3.6.1.23.10	Therefore the Sadas has a northern-facing beam.
3.6.1.24.1	May your songs, O lover of songs, be from all sides.
3.6.1.24.2	May the good things be good for the aged one, as the good things are good for the aged.
3.6.1.24.3	Indra indeed is the voice.
3.6.1.24.4	The voices are the clans.
3.6.1.24.5	Hereby he enlarges the nobility on both sides.
3.6.1.24.6	This nobility is enlarged on both sides by the clans.
3.6.1.25.1	Then he sews with the needle and thread, saying, "Thou art the seam of Indra."
3.6.1.25.2	Then he makes a knot, saying, "You are the firm of Indra."
3.6.1.25.3	lest they should be injured.
3.6.1.25.4	In the case of the prescribed rite, one should extend (the line).
3.6.1.25.5	If a snake bites the Adhvaryu or the sacrificer,
3.6.1.25.6	he touches the line which has been fixed, saying, "Thou art Indra's."
3.6.1.25.7	For the hall is Indra's.
3.6.1.26.1	Then having looked at the middle of the two Havirdhāna carts, he draws (the line) towards the north of the Agnidhriya cart.
3.6.1.26.2	Half of it should be within the altar and half outside.
3.6.1.26.3	Or else, it may be half the size inside the altar and smaller outside.
3.6.1.26.4	Or else, it may entirely be inside the altar.
3.6.1.26.5	He touches it when finished, saying, "Thou art for all gods."
3.6.1.26.6	This is for all gods in two ways.
3.6.1.26.7	In that on the previous day all gods dwell in the Vasatīvarī waters, therefore it is for all gods.
3.6.1.27.1	The gods, while performing the sacrifice, were afraid of the Asuras and Rakshas.
3.6.1.27.2	They placed the Asuras and the Rakshas on the right side.
3.6.1.27.3	They won them in the assembly hall.
3.6.1.27.4	They removed these officiating priests from the assembly hall.
3.6.1.28.1	All of them used to blaze like the Āhavanīya, the Garhapatya and the Agnīdhra.
3.6.1.28.2	But when they were extinguished, they do not blaze.
3.6.1.28.3	They surrounded them on the Agnidhra.
3.6.1.28.4	They also won half of the Agnidhra's share.
3.6.1.28.5	Then the Viśve Devas won immortality.
3.6.1.28.6	Therefore, the Vaiśvadeva.
3.6.1.29.1	The gods then kindled them as they would have kindled them.
3.6.1.29.2	Therefore, one should kindle them at the Savana at the Savana itself.
3.6.1.29.3	Therefore, he who is prosperous should perform the Agnidhra.
3.6.1.29.4	He who is known and speaks is prosperous.
3.6.1.29.5	Therefore, they lead the Dakṣiṇā to the Agnidhra first.
3.6.1.29.6	For from this the All-gods won immortality.
3.6.1.29.7	Therefore, if one finds weakness in the initiated, one should say, "He is being led to the Agnidhra." It is not a calamity, it will not be a calamity.
3.6.1.29.8	For from this the All gods won immortality.
3.6.1.29.9	That is why it is called Vaishvadevam.
3.6.2.1.1	The Visvamitr-s are his priests.
3.6.2.1.2	These are the same.
3.6.2.1.3	Those who are equal are the victorious.
3.6.2.1.4	These indeed are his own self.
3.6.2.2.1	Soma was in heaven, then here on earth were the gods.
3.6.2.2.2	The gods desired, "May Soma come to us.
3.6.2.2.3	With him having come, we shall perform sacrifice."
3.6.2.2.4	They created these two illusions, Suparni and Kadru.
3.6.2.2.5	Speech is Suparni.
3.6.2.2.6	This is Kadru.
3.6.2.2.7	They made a bet with each other.
3.6.2.3.1	They said to each other, "Whoever sees his own self first, he will win."
3.6.2.3.2	"So be it," said Kadru.
3.6.2.3.3	"Look out."
3.6.2.4.1	Suparna said, "The white horse is grazing on the shore of this water."
3.6.2.4.2	"I see him."
3.6.2.4.3	You see him."
3.6.2.4.4	"She said, "He is there."
3.6.2.4.5	"He is there." He is there."
3.6.2.4.6	"He is here."
3.6.2.4.7	"He, whom you see, is there."
3.6.2.5.1	What Suparni said to her was, "The other shore of this water."
3.6.2.5.2	The water is the altar.
3.6.2.5.3	She said that very thing.
3.6.2.5.4	"The white horse is serving at the post."
3.6.2.5.5	Agni is the white horse.
3.6.2.5.6	The sacrificial post is the tree.
3.6.2.5.7	And when Kadru said that, she put her eggs in a nest.
3.6.2.5.8	The wind blows on them.
3.6.2.5.9	I see them.'
3.6.2.5.10	That was the rope.
3.6.2.6.1	Then Suparna said, 'Let us see who wins.'
3.6.2.6.2	Kadru said, 'You fly.'
3.6.2.6.3	You will not tell me who has won."
3.6.2.7.1	She, Suparni, fell down.
3.6.2.7.2	And it happened just as Kadru had said.
3.6.2.7.3	When she came back, she was greeted with "You have won, you have won!"
3.6.2.7.4	She replied, "You have won."
3.6.2.7.5	This is the explanation of the Suparni and Kadru.
3.6.2.8.1	Kadru said, "You have indeed won me.
3.6.2.8.2	The divine Soma is this.
3.6.2.8.3	Bring it to the gods.
3.6.2.8.4	With that, redeem yourself from the gods."
3.6.2.8.5	"So be it."
3.6.2.8.6	She created the Vedas.
3.6.2.8.7	She brought down the Soma from heaven.
3.6.2.9.1	He was seated within two golden blades,
3.6.2.9.2	And they would touch each other in a moment's time.
3.6.2.9.3	They indeed were the consecration and austerity.
3.6.2.9.4	The Gandharvas, the protectors of Soma, protected him.
3.6.2.9.5	These are the Dhishnyas.
3.6.2.9.6	These are Hotr.
3.6.2.10.1	He cut off one of them, the Kusha.
3.6.2.10.2	He gave it to the gods.
3.6.2.10.3	That is consecration.
3.6.2.10.4	By that the gods consecrated themselves.
3.6.2.11.1	Then he cut off the second Kusha.
3.6.2.11.2	And he gave it to the Gods.
3.6.2.11.3	That is Tapas.
3.6.2.11.4	The gods performed Tapas, the Upasads.
3.6.2.11.5	For Tapas are the Upasads indeed.
3.6.2.12.1	He ate Soma with Khadira.
3.6.2.12.2	Therefore Khadira.
3.6.2.12.3	Because he ate with it, therefore a Khadira post is used, and a Khadira spade.
3.6.2.12.4	He stole it from the Acchāvāka while he was guarding it.
3.6.2.12.5	The Acchāvākas became inferior.
3.6.2.13.1	Indra and Agni have followed the same course as the offspring of creatures for the sake of propagation.
3.6.2.13.2	Therefore the officiating priest is Indra-Agni.
3.6.2.14.1	Therefore they protect the king while he is being consecrated, lest he should take away (the sacrificial gifts).
3.6.2.14.2	Therefore one should desire to do it there very secretly.
3.6.2.14.3	If they take away (the gifts) from him while he is being protected, he is deprived.
3.6.2.15.1	Therefore, the Brahmachari protects the teacher, the houses, and the cattle, saying, "Do not steal from us."
3.6.2.15.2	Therefore, one should desire to do it very secretly there.
3.6.2.15.3	If they steal away what is to be protected, one suffers a loss.
3.6.2.15.4	With this very thing, Suparni redeemed himself from the gods.
3.6.2.15.5	Therefore, they say, "He who worships goes to the world of the virtuous."
3.6.2.16.1	When a man is born, he is born as a debtor to Death.
3.6.2.16.2	When he performs a sacrifice, it is as if he were buying back his own self from the gods, just as Suparni bought back his own self.
3.6.2.17.1	The gods performed a sacrifice.
3.6.2.17.2	The Gandharvas, the protectors of Soma, followed him.
3.6.2.17.3	They came and said, "Do not exclude us from the sacrifice."
3.6.2.17.4	"Do not exclude us (from the sacrifice). We too have a share in the sacrifice."
3.6.2.18.1	They said, "What will happen to us then?"
3.6.2.18.2	"Just as we were the protectors of this one there, so shall we be the protectors of this (one) here."
3.6.2.19.1	The gods said, "So be it."
3.6.2.19.2	"The Soma-purchasing (priests) are the Soma-purchasing ones." Thus he points out to them the Soma-purchasers.
3.6.2.19.3	Then they said, "At the third pressing, your offering of ghee will be obtained, not the Soma-offering.
3.6.2.19.4	For your Soma-drinking has been taken away.
3.6.2.19.5	Therefore you do not deserve to offer Soma."
3.6.2.19.6	This is the third pressing. The oblation of ghee alone is offered here and not that of Soma. When the Sālākā-sticks are used to sprinkle the Dhishnya-cups,
3.6.2.20.1	"They say, "What is offered in the fire, that will be yours."
3.6.2.20.2	When they offer in the fire, it protects them.
3.6.2.20.3	"They say "What is offered to you while carrying Soma, that will be ours."
3.6.2.20.4	When they carry the Soma, going round and round, he protects them.
3.6.2.20.5	Therefore the Adhvaryu should not go beyond the prescribed places.
3.6.2.20.6	For the Adhvaryus carry the Soma.
3.6.2.20.7	They approach him with their mouths open.
3.6.2.20.8	He would be the one to open his mouth among them.
3.6.2.20.9	Agni would have burnt him, or the god Vayu, who is the lord of cattle, would have been angry with him.
3.6.2.20.10	Therefore, if there is a need for the Adhvaryu in the hall, he should move towards the north of the Agnidhra room.
3.6.2.21.1	These are placed for the protection of Soma: the Ahavaniya in front, the Marjalyas in the south, and the Agnidhra in the north.
3.6.2.21.2	Then those who are in the assembly do so afterwards.
3.6.2.22.1	They cover half of them and leave the other half uncovered.
3.6.2.22.2	They thought, "Let us cover half and leave the other one uncovered."
3.6.2.22.3	"Thus we will return to that world from which we have come, the world of heaven."
3.6.2.22.4	"Thus let us not be crooked."
3.6.2.23.1	Those whom he offers to, become visible in this world.
3.6.2.23.2	Those whom he offers to in the other world, become visible in the other world.
3.6.2.24.1	They have two names.
3.6.2.24.2	They indeed thought, "We are not known by these names to those who have taken away our Soma."
3.6.2.24.3	"Let us make second names."
3.6.2.24.4	They gave them the second names.
3.6.2.24.5	They did not succeed in those (sacrifices) where the Soma-drink was taken away, and then they shared the sacrifice.
3.6.2.24.6	Therefore, one has two names.
3.6.2.24.7	Therefore, a Brāhmaṇa who is not succeeding should give a second name.
3.6.2.24.8	He who, knowing this, gives a second name, succeeds.
3.6.2.25.1	When he offers in the fire, he offers to the gods.
3.6.2.25.2	Therefore the gods exist.
3.6.2.25.3	When they consume at the assembly, he offers to humans.
3.6.2.25.4	Therefore humans exist.
3.6.2.25.5	When the Nārāśaṃsa hymns are recited in the Havirdhāna and Sadahsthala, he offers to ancestors.
3.6.2.25.6	Therefore ancestors exist.
3.6.2.26.1	Those beings who did not participate in the sacrifice were defeated.
3.6.2.26.2	In the same way, those beings who are not defeated are included in the sacrifice.
3.6.2.26.3	After humans, animals.
3.6.2.26.4	After gods, birds, plants, and trees.
3.6.2.26.5	Whatever there is here, all of that is included in the sacrifice.
3.6.3.1.4	Having performed that sacrifice, he performs this consecration. He gives away everything.
3.6.3.2.1	When one offers the Vaisarjana oblations,
3.6.3.2.2	one gives away everything. Therefore, they are called Vaisarjana.
3.6.3.2.3	Therefore, one who is observing a vow should begin with it.
3.6.3.2.4	If one were to do it elsewhere, one should not be concerned.
3.6.3.2.5	Whatever he offers, he releases all this.
3.6.3.3.1	Whatever he offers in the Vaisarjana offerings,
3.6.3.3.2	Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
3.6.3.3.3	He, having taken this stride among the gods, on which this stride is based,
3.6.3.3.4	He crossed this (earth) with the first step, the atmosphere with the second and heaven with the last step.
3.6.3.3.5	It is indeed for this that Vishnu, the sacrifice, advances in his stride. When one offers oblations.
3.6.3.3.6	Therefore one offers oblations to the Vaisarjana deities.
3.6.3.4.1	In the afternoon, having spread out the altar and having given the half-vow, they approach and place the kindling wood, prepare the tying-sticks.
3.6.3.4.2	He places the clarified butter.
3.6.3.4.3	He cleanses the ladles.
3.6.3.4.4	The sacrificer places the king (Soma) near the Upavasatha fire.
3.6.3.4.5	Then he scatters the place for the Soma-purchasing cow behind the Garhapatya fire.
3.6.3.4.6	One stands firm by means of a step; by means of firmness.
3.6.3.5.1	Some make it in four parts.
3.6.3.5.2	Where they take up the Ahavaniya fire, there they put the Soma-purchaser's cow in the four parts.
3.6.3.5.3	They anoint the axle with four parts.
3.6.3.5.4	These are the measures of the Upayamani.
3.6.3.5.5	He strews four parts of the Garhapatya with the rear part.
3.6.3.6.1	One should not do it like that.
3.6.3.6.2	One should strew half of the Garha-patya with the posterior part.
3.6.3.6.3	Then he takes up the clarified butter for the Utpūya offering in four spoonfuls in the Juhu and Upamantya, and the clarified butter for Pṛṣadājya in five spoonfuls. "He says, "You are the light, of universal form, the kindling wood of all the gods."
3.6.3.6.4	For the Pṛṣadājy is offered to all the gods.
3.6.3.6.5	When the kindling wood has been set afire, they hold the ladles.
3.6.3.7.1	Then he offers (with the verse), "O Soma, thou art the protector from the enemies, from those who have done harm, thou art the bestower of ample protection, svāhā."
3.6.3.7.2	By this (verse) he establishes himself on this earth which is the basis.
3.6.3.7.3	By this (rite) he wins this world.
3.6.3.8.1	Then he offers the second oblation to Aptu with the verse, "Accepting the ghee, may Aptu be pleased, svāhā.
3.6.3.8.2	He indeed said this: "I am afraid of the Rakshas."
3.6.3.8.3	"Just as the Rakshas do not harm the cattle, so do not take me away after killing me, but take me away after making me smaller, for a small one is easy to protect."
3.6.3.8.4	"A small one is easy indeed to protect."
3.6.3.8.5	They took him away after making him smaller, and he became a small one.
3.6.3.8.6	The Aptu is indeed a small quantity, out of fear of the Rakshas.
3.6.3.8.7	Therefore he offers a second oblation to the Aptu.
3.6.3.9.1	They put on the kindling wood.
3.6.3.9.2	They put the Upayamanis (kindling woods) on.
3.6.3.9.3	Then he says, "Recite for Agni being carried forward, or for Soma being taken forward."
3.6.3.9.4	One should say, "Recite to Agni being carried forward."
3.6.3.10.1	They take up the ladle, the Drona vessel, the kindling wood for Vayu, the enclosing sticks made of Carṣmarya wood, the sacrificial grass, the Prastara grass, the two holding-sticks.
3.6.3.10.2	The sacrificial grass is arranged.
3.6.3.10.3	The omentum, the ladle, the rope, the kindling woods, the churning stick, the two testicles.
3.6.3.10.4	Taking these, they go forward.
3.6.3.10.5	This sacrifice indeed goes upward.
3.6.3.11.1	He recites the verse, "O Agni, lead us on the good path, O God, knowing all ways, do thou, O wise one, lead us to the highest gain. Thou art the giver of much wealth, we worship thee most."
3.6.3.11.2	He thus places Agni in front.
3.6.3.11.3	Agni, destroying the Rākṣasas and the fiends, goes in front.
3.6.3.11.4	Then they carry it with the verse, "May we be safe from the Rākṣasa, may we be safe from fiends."
3.6.3.11.5	They come to the Āgnīdhra (shed).
3.6.3.11.6	He places it in the Āgnīdhrā shed.
3.6.3.12.1	When it is placed, he offers with the verse, "May this Agni be our protector, may he go forth breaking the enemies, may he conquer the prizes, may he conquer his enemies, may he be victorious, svāhā."
3.6.3.12.2	By this very (rite) he stands firm in this world of the atmosphere.
3.6.3.12.3	By this he touches this world.
3.6.3.13.1	They put down the pot of the chaff, the Vāyu offerings, there itself.
3.6.3.13.2	Then taking the other (pot) they come (to the sacrificial place).
3.6.3.13.3	They place it north of the Āhavanīya fire.
3.6.3.14.1	The Adhvaryu takes up the sprinkling water.
3.6.3.14.2	He first sprinkles the sacrificial grass, then the altar.
3.6.3.14.3	Then they give him the sacrificial grass.
3.6.3.14.4	He places it in front with a knot.
3.6.3.14.5	Having sprinkled and spread it, he loosens the knot. The sacrificial grass is tied with a knot. He takes it.
3.6.3.14.6	Having taken the sacrificial grass, he spreads the sacrificial grass with one more layer.
3.6.3.14.7	Having removed the sacrificial grass, he places the enclosing sticks made of Karṣmarya wood.
3.6.3.14.8	Having placed the enclosing sticks, he places the two kindling woods.
3.6.3.14.9	Having placed them,
3.6.3.15.1	he offers with the verse, "O Vishnu, extend yourself widely, extend yourself widely for our prosperity. Drink the ghee, O ghee-born one. Go to the lord of sacrifice. Svāhā."
3.6.3.15.2	By this very (rite) he establishes himself in this heaven, in the firm foundation.
3.6.3.15.3	By this he touches this world, when he offers with this (verse).
3.6.3.16.1	When he offers with the Vaisnavya verse, he makes him the youngest, and then places him beyond the others.
3.6.3.16.2	For the Aptu is indeed small.
3.6.3.16.3	Having obtained this safety, he who is that (sacrificer) makes the sacrifice.
3.6.3.16.4	For sacrifice is Vishnu.
3.6.3.16.5	Therefore he offers with a verse to Vishnu.
3.6.3.17.1	Then having approached the ladles, having touched water, he offers the king.
3.6.3.17.2	That he offers the king having approached the ladlas, having touched water.
3.6.3.17.3	The ghee is the thunderbolt.
3.6.3.17.4	The Soma is the semen.
3.6.3.17.5	"Do not injure the Soma with the vajra-like butter."
3.6.3.17.6	Having approached it, he touches the ladle and then hands over the king.
3.6.3.18.1	He spreads a black antelope skin on the southern Havirdhāna mound.
3.6.3.18.2	He approaches it, saying, "O god Savitr, this is your Soma. Protect it, do not injure it."
3.6.3.18.3	He gives him over to Savitr alone for protection.
3.6.3.19.1	Then he stands up after having followed (the Soma-drains). "This is thee, O divine Soma, the divine god who has approached the gods. This am I, the human, with prosperity and wealth."
3.6.3.19.2	Agni and Soma indeed place him in the womb of death who consecrates himself.
3.6.3.19.3	For the consecration-oblation is offered to Agni and Visnu.
3.6.3.19.4	He who is Vishnu is Soma.
3.6.3.19.5	He who consecrates himself becomes the oblation of the gods.
3.6.3.19.6	They place him in the womb of the earth.
3.6.3.19.7	He is released from the Soma-juice when he says, "You, O divine Soma, have approached the gods. I, with the prosperity of wealth, approach men."
3.6.3.19.8	The prosperity of wealth is the earth.
3.6.3.19.9	"Together with the earth" is what he says.
3.6.3.20.1	Then he comes out, saying, "Svāhā! I am freed from Varuna's noose."
3.6.3.20.2	He who is in the noose of another is indeed in Varuna's own noose.
3.6.3.20.3	He is freed from Varuna himself when he says, "Svāha! I am freed."
3.6.3.21.1	Then he puts the kindling-wood on the Āhavaniya fire, saying, "O Agni, the guardian of vows, I am under thy guardianship."
3.6.3.21.2	For Agni is the guardian of vows among the gods.
3.6.3.21.3	Therefore he says, "O Agni the guardian of vows I am under thy protection."
3.6.3.21.4	The body that was yours is now mine; the body that was mine is now yours. As befits us, O lord of vows, follow the vows. The lord of initiation has initiated me; the lord of austerities has made me perform austerities.
3.6.3.21.5	This is the direct release from Agni.
3.6.3.21.6	He performs the sacrifice with his own true self.
3.6.3.21.7	Therefore they eat here.
3.6.3.21.8	He becomes a human being.
3.6.3.21.9	Therefore, they give him this name here.
3.6.3.21.10	He becomes a human being."
3.6.3.21.11	Then, what they do not eat before is like not eating the offered oblation.
3.6.3.21.12	Therefore, one should not eat while consecrated.
3.6.3.21.13	Then, he releases the fingers here.
3.6.4.1.1	One offers with the Vaisnavya verse while about to erect the sacrificial post.
3.6.4.1.2	The sacrificial post is indeed Vaisnava.
3.6.4.1.3	Therefore one offers with a verse to Vishnu.
3.6.4.2.1	If one offers with a Vishnu verse,
3.6.4.2.2	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
3.6.4.2.3	One thus makes the sacrificial post with the sacrifice.
3.6.4.2.4	Therefore one offers with a hymn to Vishnu.
3.6.4.3.1	When one offers with a ladle, one takes four spoonfuls of ghee and offers.
3.6.4.3.2	If he offers with the ladle, then with the ladle. "He offers with the formula, "O Vishnu, extend yourself widely, make room for us. Drink ghee, O ghee-born one, go to the lord of sacrifice, svāhā."
3.6.4.4.1	Whatever ghee is left over, he takes it.
3.6.4.4.2	Whatever is the tool of the carpenter, he takes it from the carpenter.
3.6.4.4.3	They go there.
3.6.4.4.4	The sacrificial post which they erect,
3.6.4.5.1	Having touched him thus, he recites this verse. Standing towards the east, he recites, "I have gone beyond others, not approached others."
3.6.4.5.2	For indeed, one goes beyond others, not approaches others.
3.6.4.5.3	Therefore, he says, "I have approached others, not approached them."
3.6.4.6.1	"I have known you as inferior to others, superior to the inferior."
3.6.4.6.2	He severs him from those who are above him, if they are above him.
3.6.4.6.3	"He severs him from the lower ones."
3.6.4.6.4	He severs him indeed from the lower ones, if they are below him.
3.6.4.6.5	Therefore he says, "I have severed you from those who are below you, and from those who are higher."
3.6.4.7.1	We choose thee, O divine tree, for the sacrifice to the gods.
3.6.4.7.2	Just as one would choose a good man from among many for a task, and he would be pleased and do the task, so does he choose him from among many for the good task.
3.6.4.7.3	He becomes pleased and does the task.
3.6.4.8.1	"May the gods accept thee for the sacrifice to the gods."
3.6.4.8.2	That is indeed successful, for whom the gods accept for a good deed.
3.6.4.8.3	Therefore he says, "May the gods approve thee for the sacrifice."
3.6.4.9.1	Then with the ladle he touches (the post) with the words, "For thee to Vishnu."
3.6.4.9.2	For the sacrificial post is connected with Vishnu.
3.6.4.9.3	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
3.6.4.9.4	For the sacrifice indeed severs him.
3.6.4.9.5	Therefore he says, "To Vishnu thee."
3.6.4.10.1	Then he places a fresh darbha grass within, saying, "O plant, protect me."
3.6.4.10.2	The axe is indeed a thunderbolt.
3.6.4.10.3	Thus indeed this thunderbolt, the axe, does not injure him.
3.6.4.10.4	Then he strikes with the axe, saying, "Do not injure him, O mother."
3.6.4.10.5	The axe indeed is a thunderbolt.
3.6.4.10.6	Thus indeed this thunderbolt, this axe, does not injure him.
3.6.4.11.1	He takes up the first chip that he cuts off.
3.6.4.11.2	If he cuts it off without a notch,
3.6.4.11.3	then indeed they carry it away without a notch.
3.6.4.11.4	Thus indeed it does not obstruct him.
3.6.4.12.1	He should let it fall towards the east.
3.6.4.12.2	For the eastern direction belongs to the gods.
3.6.4.12.3	Or towards the north.
3.6.4.12.4	The northern direction is for men.
3.6.4.12.5	Then (he should say) to the one who is facing the east.
3.6.4.12.6	He should cover him with the southern direction.
3.6.4.12.7	This is the direction of the manes.
3.6.4.12.8	Therefore he should cover him with this direction.
3.6.4.13.1	When he is moving away, he should recite the following verse: "Do not injure the sky, do not harm the atmosphere, be united with the earth."
3.6.4.13.2	This is indeed a thunderbolt when they cut down the sacrificial post.
3.6.4.13.3	From this thunderbolt, when it falls, these worlds are shaken.
3.6.4.13.4	He appeases it from these worlds.
3.6.4.13.5	Thus he does not injure these worlds when they are appeased.
3.6.4.14.1	When he says, "Do not injure the heaven," he means, "Do not harm the heaven."
3.6.4.14.2	"Do not injure the sky." There is nothing hidden here.
3.6.4.14.3	"May you be born from the earth." He says this as "May you be known from the earth."
3.6.4.14.4	"This is your own wish, O one who knows, he has led you to great good fortune."
3.6.4.14.5	This indeed is his own wish, the shining one, who leads him.
3.6.4.15.1	Then he offers the Avrashan-oblation, with the verse, "May the evil spirits not rise up against us from this side."
3.6.4.15.2	The clarified butter is indeed a thunderbolt.
3.6.4.15.3	He thus repels the evil spirits and the Rakshas by means of the thunderbolt.
3.6.4.15.4	Thus the evil spirits and Rakshas do not rise up against him.
3.6.4.15.5	The clarified butter indeed is the semen.
3.6.4.15.6	He thus places the semen in the trees.
3.6.4.15.7	Therefore, from the semen of the Avraścana, the trees are born.
3.6.4.16.1	He offers, "From here, O divine tree, grow with a hundred shoots, with a thousand shoots, may we grow."
3.6.4.16.2	There is nothing hidden here.
3.6.4.17.1	He puts it around.
3.6.4.17.2	It should be as much as he first put around.
3.6.4.18.1	One should put around five cubits.
3.6.4.20.2	The Gāyatrī has eight syllables.
3.6.4.20.3	The Gāyatrī is the first half of the sacrifice.
3.6.4.20.4	This is the first half (of the sacrifice).
3.6.4.20.5	Therefore one should make it eight cubits in length.
3.6.4.21.1	One should not make it nine cubits in length,
3.6.4.21.2	The sacrifice is threefold.
3.6.4.21.3	Nine is threefold.
3.6.4.21.4	Therefore one should not make it (the altar) nine cubits in size.
3.6.4.22.1	One should make it eleven cubits in length
3.6.4.22.2	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
3.6.4.27.4	This is the first half of the sacrifice.
3.6.4.27.5	Therefore it is eight-cornered.
3.7.1.1.1	He takes up the ladle, saying, "I take thee in the impulse of the divine Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, thou art a woman."
3.7.1.1.2	The bond of this formula is the same.
3.7.1.1.3	This is a woman, namely the ladle.
3.7.1.1.4	Therefore he says, "Thou art a woman."
3.7.1.2.1	Then, as she is digging the pit, she says, "I am cutting off the necks of the demons."
3.7.1.2.2	The spade is a thunderbolt.
3.7.1.2.3	With the thunderbolt he cuts off the necks of demons and evil spirits.
3.7.1.3.1	Then he digs.
3.7.1.3.2	He digs the mound towards the east.
3.7.1.3.3	He digs a pit above it.
3.7.1.3.4	He places the sacrificial post towards the east at its front.
3.7.1.3.5	He puts down the sacrificial grass measuring just that much above.
3.7.1.3.6	He puts down the top part of the sacrificial post above that.
3.7.1.3.7	He puts the cup on the front and side.
3.7.1.3.8	Then the sprinkling is done with barley.
3.7.1.3.9	That is the same bond.
3.7.1.4.1	When he sows the barley, he says, "Thou art barley; may we be victorious over our enemies and adversaries."
3.7.1.4.2	There is nothing hidden here.
3.7.1.4.3	Then he sprinkles (the ground).
3.7.1.4.4	The sprinkling has only one relation.
3.7.1.4.5	He makes it pure.
3.7.1.5.1	He sprinkles, saying, "For thee the heaven, for thee the atmosphere, for thee the earth."
3.7.1.5.2	The sacrificial post is indeed a thunderbolt for the protection of these worlds.
3.7.1.5.3	"For the protection of these worlds, I sprinkle thee." Thus indeed he says.
3.7.1.6.1	Then those which are left over after sprinkling, he puts in a pit, saying, "May the worlds be purified, the abode of the Fathers."
3.7.1.6.2	The pit is dug out for the Fathers.
3.7.1.6.3	He makes it fit for sacrifice.
3.7.1.7.1	Then he strews the sacrificial grass with their tips pointing east and west, with the words, "Thou art the seat of the Fathers."
3.7.1.7.2	This is his offering to the Fathers, for what is dug in is dedicated to the Fathers.
3.7.1.7.3	As the dug-in plant is measured, so is he measured in these plants.
3.7.1.8.1	Then he throws the Yūpa-wood.
3.7.1.8.2	The outer part of the wood of trees is indeed their brilliance.
3.7.1.8.3	Therefore, when they cut off the outer part of the trees, they dry up.
3.7.1.8.4	For that is their brilliance.
3.7.1.8.5	When he throws the wood of the sacrificial post, he does so thinking, 'I am making it brilliant.'
3.7.1.8.6	And because it is this one and not another, for this one is consecrated by the Yajus.
3.7.1.8.7	Therefore he throws away the Yūpa-wood.
3.7.1.9.1	He throws it away with the formula, "Thou art the leader, thou art the leader of the Upholders."
3.7.1.9.2	It is cut off from him in front.
3.7.1.9.3	Therefore he says, "Thou art a leader, thou art a leader of the Upaholders."
3.7.1.9.4	"Thou shalt stand above this one who has wealth."
3.7.1.9.5	For he stands above it.
3.7.1.9.6	Therefore he says, "He will be above this wealth of yours."
3.7.1.10.1	Then with the ladle he offers the clarified butter into the pit, saying, "May the demons and fiends not rise up below."
3.7.1.10.2	Clarified butter is indeed a thunderbolt.
3.7.1.10.3	He thus repels the demons and fiens with the thunderbolt.
3.7.1.10.4	Thus the demons and fients do not rise up below.
3.7.1.10.5	Then having gone around in front, he anoints the sacrificial post while sitting towards the north.
3.7.1.10.6	He says, "Do you recite the Anushtubh verse for the sacrificial post being anointed."
3.7.1.11.1	He anoints it with the verse, "May Savitr, the god, anoint you with honey."
3.7.1.11.2	Savitr is the impeller of the gods.
3.7.1.11.3	The sacrificial post is indeed the sacrificer in the sense of being the impeller.
3.7.1.11.4	Everything here is honey, whatever there is.
3.7.1.11.5	He touches him with all this.
3.7.1.11.6	Savitar, the bestower, bestows it on him.
3.7.1.11.7	Therefore he says, "May Savitar, the god, anoint you with honey."
3.7.1.12.1	Then he releases the cup after having examined it on both sides, saying, "From the well-grown plants."
3.7.1.12.2	Indeed, that which is held in the middle is like a pipal.
3.7.1.12.3	This is the Pipal tree that has been struck down by the wind.
3.7.1.12.4	He does it just as it was bound together and cut off.
3.7.1.12.5	Therefore it is as if it were bound in the middle.
3.7.1.13.1	He anoints the Agniṣṭha (bricks) at the end.
3.7.1.13.2	The Agniṣṭha is the sacrificer.
3.7.1.13.3	The Agnișṭha is the butter.
3.7.1.13.4	He anoint the sacrificer with the butter.
3.7.1.13.5	Therefore he anoints the end of the fire-stick.
3.7.1.13.6	Then he touches the ground all around, going round it.
3.7.1.13.7	Then he says, "Recite when the post is being raised."
3.7.1.14.1	He raises it, touching the sky with the front, the atmosphere with the middle, and the earth with the top, saying, "I have taken the sky."
3.7.1.14.2	The post is indeed the thunderbolt, for the conquest of these worlds.
3.7.1.14.3	With that thunderbolt he touches these worlds. He drives away the enemies from these worlds.
3.7.1.15.1	Then he measures (the altar). "The place where the cows are, with many horns, without fatigue, there is the supreme place of the great-going Vishnu. It is called 'Bhuri'.
3.7.1.15.2	He measures with this Tristubh metre.
3.7.1.15.3	The thunderbolt is the Tristubh metre.
3.7.1.15.4	The sacrificial post is made of wood.
3.7.1.15.5	Therefore, he lays down the Triṣṭubh verse.
3.7.1.16.1	He lays down the Agniṣṭha verse in the Agni-hole.
3.7.1.16.2	The Agniṣṭha is the sacrificer.
3.7.1.16.3	Agni is indeed the sacrifice.
3.7.1.16.4	If one were to lay down the Agniṣtha verse in the Agni hole, then the sacrificer would be laying down the sacrifice.
3.7.1.16.5	Therefore, one lays down the Agniștha verse in the Agnīdhra hole.
3.7.1.16.6	Then he encloses it.
3.7.1.16.7	Then he arranges the sacrificial grass.
3.7.1.16.8	Then he places the pot.
3.7.1.17.1	Then he recites the following verse: "Behold the deeds of Vishnu, from where he saw the vows, the union of Indra and his friend."
3.7.1.17.2	He who erected the sacrificial post struck the thunderbolt.
3.7.1.17.3	"He sees the victory of Vishnu" is what he means to say when he says, "See the deeds of Vishnu, see the vows from where." "He is a friend of Indra, fit to be yoked."
3.7.1.17.4	Indra is indeed the deity of the sacrifice.
3.7.1.17.5	The sacrificial post is dedicated to Vishnu.
3.7.1.17.6	He makes it with Indra.
3.7.1.17.7	Therefore he says, "He is a friendly of Indra, fit for being yoked."
3.7.1.18.1	Then he looks at the cup, saying, "That is the supreme abode of Vishnu, which the wise always see, as the eye is stretched out in the sky."
3.7.1.18.2	He who erected the sacrificial post struck at the thunderbolt.
3.7.1.18.3	He says this, "One sees that victory of Vishnu."
3.7.1.19.1	He then performs the Parivya (rites).
3.7.1.19.2	He performs the Parivyas for the sake of not being without fire.
3.7.1.19.3	Therefore he performs them here itself.
3.7.1.19.4	Here itself is the garment.
3.7.1.19.5	He puts food in it.
3.7.1.19.6	For here the food is established.
3.7.1.19.7	Therefore one should spend it here.
3.7.1.20.1	He spends it with three parts.
3.7.1.20.2	Food is threefold.
3.7.1.20.3	Animals are food.
3.7.1.20.4	Father and mother.
3.7.1.20.5	What is born is the third.
3.7.1.20.6	Therefore he spends it with three.
3.7.1.21.1	He spends it, saying, "Thou art the spending of the sacrifice; may the divine classes spend thee; may they spend this sacrificer of mine for wealth among men."
3.7.1.21.2	He prays for a blessing on the sacrificer when he says, "May they spend this sacrificeris of mine for wealth."
3.7.1.22.1	Then he buries the piece of the sacrificial post, saying, "Son of heaven art thou."
3.7.1.22.2	This is his offspring.
3.7.1.22.3	Therefore, if the Yūpa is eleven-fold, one should cover one's own (portion) without confusion.
3.7.1.22.4	For those who follow the wise, offspring are born to them.
3.7.1.22.5	But for one who covers in confusion, not one's own, offspring are born following the unwise.
3.7.1.22.6	Therefore, one should cover only one's own without confusion.
3.7.1.23.1	The Yūpa-wood is the means of ascending to the heaven of the gods.
3.7.1.23.2	This is the rope.
3.7.1.23.3	The Yūpa- wood is for the rope.
3.7.1.23.4	From the Yūpa-woods, the cup.
3.7.1.23.5	From the cup, he attains the heavenly world.
3.7.1.24.1	And because it is called Svaru,
3.7.1.24.2	it is cut off from this (Yūpa-wood).
3.7.1.24.3	It becomes his own Svaru.
3.7.1.24.4	Therefore, it is called 'SVARU'.
3.7.1.25.1	By that which is dug out, one conquers the world of the fathers.
3.7.1.25.2	Then, what is above the dug out and below the girdle, by that one conquers the human world.
3.7.1.25.3	Then, above the girdle and below the cup, by that one attains the world of the gods.
3.7.1.26.5	This is the first half of the sacrifice.
3.7.1.26.6	Therefore one offers in the first half.
3.7.1.27.1	The gods, by means of the sacrifice, won this victory, which is theirs.
3.7.1.27.2	They said, "How can this (victory) not be ascended by men?"
3.7.1.27.3	Having thought about the essence of the sacrifice, as bees would extract honey,
3.7.1.27.4	Having shaken the sacrifice with the sacrificial post, they disappeared.
3.7.1.27.5	And because he shook it with this (post), therefore it is called yūpa.
3.7.1.27.6	Indeed, knowledge is in front.
3.7.1.27.7	In front is the speed of mind.
3.7.1.27.8	Therefore one offers in the eastern half.
3.7.1.28.1	It becomes eight-cornered.
3.7.1.28.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
3.7.1.28.3	The eastern half of the sacrifice is the Gayatri.
3.7.1.28.4	This is the first half of the sacrifice, therefore it is eight-cornered.
3.7.1.29.1	They used to strike it as they do now, saying, "The gods did it."
3.7.1.29.2	Then the demons drank the sacrifice.
3.7.1.30.1	The gods said to the Adhvaryu, "Offer only the Yupa-wood."
3.7.1.30.2	Then it becomes his own.
3.7.1.30.3	Thus the demons do not obstruct the sacrifice, thinking, "This is the raised thunderbolt."
3.7.1.31.1	The Adhvaryu offered a piece of the sacrificial post.
3.7.1.31.2	Then it became his own.
3.7.1.31.3	Then the demons did not obstruct the sacrifice further, thinking, "That is the raised thunderbolt."
3.7.1.32.1	In the same way, he offers on the sacrificial post itself.
3.7.1.32.2	Then it becomes his own.
3.7.1.32.3	Thus the demons do not drink the sacrifice. This is the raised thunderbolt.
3.7.1.32.4	He offers, "May your smoke go to heaven, the light to heaven, may the ashes fill the earth. Svāhā."
3.7.2.1.1	The extent of the altar is the extent of the earth.
3.7.2.1.2	The sacrificial posts are like thunderbolts.
3.7.2.1.3	He thus strikes this earth with these thunderbolts.
3.7.2.1.4	And he destroys his enemies on it.
3.7.2.1.5	Therefore the sacrificial posts are eleven in number.
3.7.2.1.6	The twelfth is the sacrificial post which is erected.
3.7.2.1.7	He places it to the south.
3.7.2.1.8	Now, why the twelfth is the sacrificial posts,
3.7.2.2.1	The gods, while performing the sacrifice, were afraid of being caught by the Asuras and Rakshasas.
3.7.2.2.2	That which is raised like an arrow,
3.7.2.2.3	it either strikes or does not strike.
3.7.2.2.4	Like a stick that has been struck,
3.7.2.2.5	it either hits or does not hit.
3.7.2.2.6	Then the twelve-fold sacrificial post is erected. It is like an arrow, stretched out, like a raised but not yet released bow. This thunderbolt is raised on the right side for the destruction of the demons and Rakshasas.
3.7.2.2.7	Therefore the twelve-fold post is erected.
3.7.2.3.1	He places it, saying, "This is your world in the earth, your animal."
3.7.2.3.2	The animal and the sacrificial post.
3.7.2.3.3	He directs the animals towards the forest.
3.7.2.3.4	By that one becomes possessed of cattle.
3.7.2.3.5	They say that the two-fold Yūpa is the consecration for the Ekādaśinī.
3.7.2.3.6	Some consecrate for the next day's Soma sacrifice, saying, "We consecrate the Yūpa for the next day and for the Prākuvartī."
3.7.2.4.1	One should not do it like that.
3.7.2.4.2	He should erect the sacrificial post in the fire-chamber.
3.7.2.4.3	The Adhvaryu does not attend to the post after it has been erected.
3.7.2.4.4	They spend the night without attending to the post.
3.7.2.4.5	That is the only exception.
3.7.2.4.6	They erect the sacrificial post for the sake of the animals.
3.7.2.4.7	They offer the animals in the morning.
3.7.2.4.8	Therefore one should erect it in the morning.
3.7.2.5.1	If the one to the north of the Agni-sthala is to be erected first, then one should erect that one first, then the one on the right, then the one to the left, the one on the left being the last.
3.7.2.5.2	Then it becomes the northern one.
3.7.2.6.1	Or else they say otherwise: One should erect the one on the south first, then the northern one, then the one again on the south, the one on south being the last.
3.7.2.6.2	And thus the sacrifice is completed with the offering of the laugh.
3.7.2.7.1	The one who is the tallest should be the one to the south, then the shorter, then the shorter; the shortest one to the north.
3.7.2.7.2	Thus it becomes northern.
3.7.2.8.1	Then they erect the post for the wives.
3.7.2.8.2	The post for the wives is erected for the sake of all.
3.7.2.8.3-10	He offers the animal dedicated to Tvashtri. Tvashtri indeed develops the deposited semen. He develops it here. It becomes a goat. The goat is indeed the begetter. Therefore it becomes a goat. It should not be kept. One should throw it away after having put it in fire.
3.7.2.8.11	If he were to establish it, he would be deprived of offspring.
3.7.2.8.12	He releases the offspring.
3.7.2.8.13	Therefore one should not establish it.
3.7.2.8.14	One should release it only after it has been burnt.
3.7.3.1.1	The animal and the sacrificial post
3.7.3.1.2	One never sacrifices an animal without a sacrificial post.
3.7.3.1.3	Now, when the animals did not see the food that was to be offered, they were afraid. Just as now the beings see food.
3.7.3.1.4	Just as this biped man is upright, so the bipeds moved upright.
3.7.3.2.1	Then the gods saw this thunderbolt, which is the sacrificial post.
3.7.3.2.2	They erected it.
3.7.3.2.3	Out of fear, they fled.
3.7.3.2.4	Then the four feet came into existence.
3.7.3.2.5	Then food came into existence, as it is now.
3.7.3.2.6	For these (beings) stood on him.
3.7.3.2.7	Therefore they offer the animal sacrifice to the sacrificial post, never to anything else than the sacrificial post.
3.7.3.3.1	Having prepared the animal and having churned out fire, he yokes it.
3.7.3.3.2	Now, when the animals did not see that (oblation) at first, they would have been the oblation, as now they offer them in the fire after becoming oblations.
3.7.3.3.3	The gods then surrounded them.
3.7.3.3.4	Those who were surrounded did not go away.
3.7.3.4.1	They said: "These do not know his way, that they offer oblations in the fire, nor this support.
3.7.3.4.2	Having obstructed the animals, having kindled the fire, we shall offer the fire into the fire.
3.7.3.4.3	They will know that this indeed is the path of the oblation, this is its foundation.
3.7.3.4.4	It is indeed in the fire that the oblation is offered."
3.7.3.4.5	Then they will approach.
3.7.3.4.6	Then they will be ready for the embrace with a peaceful mind.
3.7.3.5.1	They, having stopped them, having churned out fire, offered fire into the fire.
3.7.3.5.2	They knew, "This indeed is the path of the oblation, this is its foundation."
3.7.3.5.3	"Indeed, the oblation is offered into fire."
3.7.3.5.4	Then they went away.
3.7.3.5.5	Then they became attached to the mind of peace.
3.7.3.6.1	In the same way, having first covered the animal, he kindles the fire and offers the fire into the fire.
3.7.3.6.2	He knows that this is indeed the destination of the oblation.
3.7.3.6.3	"It is indeed offered into the fire."
3.7.3.6.4	Then he goes back.
3.7.3.6.5	Then he becomes intent on the offering.
3.7.3.6.6	Therefore, having prepared the animal, one should kindle the fire and consecrate it.
3.7.3.7.1	They say, "One should not prepare it."
3.7.3.7.2	One should not kindle the fire.
3.7.3.7.3	One should take the rope, go near the fire, and consecrate it."
3.7.3.7.4	One must not do it like that.
3.7.3.7.5	One should do it according to the Dharma, as one wishes.
3.7.3.7.6	Therefore, one should do it like this.
3.7.3.8.1	Then, taking grass, he offers it with the formula, "Thou art the second, thou art the second."
3.7.3.8.2	For the second is the vigorous one.
3.7.3.9.1	He takes the grass and says, "Thou art upāvīr."
3.7.3.9.2	For the upāvīr is the second.
3.7.3.9.3	Therefore he says, "Thou are upāvīr".
3.7.3.9.4	"The divine clans have gone to the gods."
3.7.3.9.5	For the divine clans are the cattle.
3.7.3.9.6	"The bones have been placed for the gods," thus indeed he says when he says, "Homage to the gods, the divine clans have come forth."
3.7.3.10.1	"The wise, the fire-measuring ones,"
3.7.3.10.2	For the gods are wise.
3.7.3.10.3	Therefore he says, "The wise, the Fire-measuring ones."
3.7.3.11.1	"O god Tvashtar, in the Vasus, delight!"
3.7.3.11.2	Tvashtar indeed is the lord of cattle.
3.7.3.11.3	Cattle are Vasus.
3.7.3.11.4	The gods, standing there, said to Tvashtri, "Come near." He said, "O god Tvashtri! May the wealth be pleasing."
3.7.3.12.1	"May your offerings be pleasing."
3.7.3.12.2	When they were placed here, they were to be the offerings. Therefore he says, "May your offerings be pleasant."
3.7.3.13.1	"May you be pleased with the Revanta."
3.7.3.13.2	For the cattle are Revanta.
3.7.3.13.3	Therefore he says, "Do ye delight in Revati."
3.7.3.13.4	"O Brihaspati, do thou hold the wealth."
3.7.3.13.5	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman.
3.7.3.13.6	Wealth is cattle.
3.7.3.13.7	The gods, standing here, placed them beyond with Brahman.
3.7.3.13.8	They did not transgress it.
3.7.3.13.9	In the same way he places them beyond with Brahman,
3.7.3.13.10	They do not transgress it.
3.7.3.13.11	Therefore he says, "O Brihaspati, with the string I hold the treasures."
3.7.3.13.12	Having made a noose, he releases it.
3.7.3.13.13	Now, about the releasing itself.
3.7.4.1.1	Having made a loop, he releases it, saying, "I release you with the noose of the divine oblation of truth."
3.7.4.1.2	This is indeed the noose of Varuna.
3.7.4.1.3	He releases him in the noose of truth.
3.7.4.3.1	Then he binds it, saying, "In the impulse of the divine Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, I bind thee agreeable to Agni and Soma."
3.7.4.3.2	Just as when one takes up an oblation for a deity, he announces it, so here he announces it to the deities.
3.7.4.3.3	Then he sprinkles it, saying,
3.7.4.3.4	"One is the relation of sprinkling.
3.7.4.3.5	He makes it fit for sacrifice.
3.7.4.4.1	He sprinkles it with the formula, "From the waters and plants."
3.7.4.4.2	He makes it fit for the sacrifice from where it originates.
3.7.4.4.3	When it rains, then the plants grow.
3.7.4.4.4	Having eaten the plants and drunk water, then this juice originates. From juice comes semen, from semen animals.
3.7.4.4.5	He makes it pure from that very thing from which it is born and from which it comes into existence.
3.7.4.5.1	"He says, "May your mother and father approve of you."
3.7.4.5.2	For he is born from his mother and father."
3.7.4.5.3	He makes it pure from the very thing from which he is born.
3.7.4.5.4	"He (the sacrificer) says, "May the brother of the same mother, the friend of the same group approve of you."
3.7.4.5.5	"He says, 'I undertake it with your permission.' This is what he means.
3.7.4.5.6	'I sprinkle you for Agni and Soma.'
3.7.4.5.7	He makes it fit for the deities for whom he undertakes it.
3.7.4.6.1	Then he takes it, saying, 'You are the edge of the waters.'
3.7.4.6.2	He makes him fit for the inner (deities).
3.7.4.6.3	Then he sprinkles below with the verse, "The divine waters may be gratified. May the oblation to the gods be well-offered."
3.7.4.6.4	He makes it pure on all sides.
3.7.4.7.1	Then he says, "Recite to Agni being kindled."
3.7.4.7.2	Having poured the second libation, moving around the ladles without touching them, he anoints the animal with the ladle.
3.7.4.7.3	The second libation is the head of the sacrifice.
3.7.4.7.4	This is the sacrifice here, namely, the animal.
3.7.4.7.5	He thus restores the head of the sacrifice.
3.7.4.7.6	Therefore he anoints the animal with the ladle.
3.7.4.8.1	He anoints it on the forehead with the formula, "May thy breath go with the wind." On the shoulders with the formula, "May thy limbs go with the Yajus." On the hips with the formula, "May the lord of sacrifice go with the blessing."
3.7.4.8.2	He says this, "May you obtain that for which you are sacrificing the animal."
3.7.4.9.1	When an animal is being slaughtered, its breath goes into the wind.
3.7.4.9.2	He says this, "Obtain that for which your breath has gone into the wind."
3.7.4.9.3	"May your limbs be joined with the Yajus."
3.7.4.9.4	They sacrifice with his limbs.
3.7.4.9.5	"May you obtain that for which the limbs of yours have been offered." Thus indeed he says.
3.7.4.9.6	"May the lord of sacrifice be blessed."
3.7.4.9.7	He thus prays for the blessing of the sacrificer.
3.7.4.9.8	"May you obtain that which you have prayed for the blessing of your sacrificer." Thus indeed he (the Adhvaryu) says.
3.7.4.9.9	He places the two ladles.
3.7.4.9.10	Then he addresses the Pravara (priest).
3.7.4.9.11	He is indeed a relative.
3.7.4.10.1	Then he invites the second (officiant).
3.7.4.10.2	For there are two Hotr-priests here.
3.7.4.10.3	He invites the Maitrāvaruṇa.
3.7.4.10.4	He invites only the sacrificer, saying, "Agni is the leader of the divine hosts."
3.7.4.10.5	For Agni is the mouth of the deities.
3.7.4.10.6	Therefore he says, "Agni is the leader of the divine hosts."
3.7.4.10.7	"This sacrificer is of men."
3.7.4.10.8	For he belongs to that half in which he performs the sacrifice.
3.7.4.10.9	Therefore he says, "This sacrificer is among men."
3.7.4.10.10	"The Garhapatya shines brightly among them. The two of you are the cold ones."
3.7.4.11.4	When he offers to Agni, he gives it to Agni.
3.7.4.11.5	And whatever blessing the priests here bless the sacrificer with, Agni fulfills it all for him.
3.7.4.11.6	They indeed touch the blessings, but not the body.
3.7.4.11.7	Therefore he says, "We touch the blessings, we do not touch the body."
3.8.1.1.1	When the Hotṛ, having begun (the recitation of the Sāmans), sits down in the Hotṛ's seat, he sits down and recites. The Adhvaryu, having been recited to, takes up the ladles.
3.8.1.2.1	Then they perform with the Apṛṇas.
3.8.1.2.2	When one consecrates himself, he undertakes the sacrifice with his whole mind, with his whole self.
3.8.1.3.3	This is the extent of the man.
3.8.1.3.4	All this nourishes his entire self.
3.8.1.3.5	Therefore there are eleven Prayājas.
3.8.1.4.1	Having called out, he says, "Send the kindling wood."
3.8.1.4.2	Sending, sending, he performs with ten Prayājas, taking them together in the fourth and fourth Prayāja.
3.8.1.4.3	Having offered ten Prayājas he says, "Bring the instruction."
3.8.1.6.2	The Agnidh takes up the fire-brand and makes a fire-encircling.
3.8.1.6.3	When he makes a fire-circling, he encloses it with fire without any gap, thinking, "May not the demons and the Raksases destroy it."
3.8.1.6.4	For Agni is the destroyer of demons.
3.8.1.6.5	Therefore he makes a fire circling.
3.8.1.6.6	When they are cooking it, he moves around it.
3.8.1.8.2	Just as when one is swallowed, so does this become for him when he makes the fire-encircling.
3.8.1.8.3	Just as when one is released from being swallowed, one cuts it off and gives it to another, so does this happen.
3.8.1.8.4	Therefore, having extinguished the embers of this very torch, they should cook him in it.
3.8.1.9.1	Then taking the torch, the Agnīdhra goes forward and stands.
3.8.1.9.2	He thus places Agni in front of him. Agni, destroying the evil spirits and the Rakshas, goes in front.
3.8.1.9.3	Then they lead the animal to a place free from danger and evil spirits.
3.8.1.9.4	The Pratiprasthātṛ priest begins with the Vāpā and Śrapaṇī ladles. The Adhvaryu with the Pratiprasthātr, the sacrificer with the Adhvaryu.
3.8.1.10.1	They say, "This (animal) should not be begun with the sacrificer.
3.8.1.10.2	They lead him to Death.
3.8.1.10.3	Therefore one should not begin.
3.8.1.10.4	One should begin only after him.
3.8.1.10.5	Those who lead him to the sacrifice do not lead him to Death,
3.8.1.10.6	Therefore one should begin only after (the others).
3.8.1.10.7	If one does not begin after the sacrifice, one would be separated from oneself.
3.8.1.10.8	Therefore one must begin after (the others)
3.8.1.10.9	The Pratiprasthātṛ (priest) begins the offering of the Vapa and Śrapaṇī (oblations) after the Adhvaryu, the Adhvaryus after the sacrificer.
3.8.1.10.10	This is the beginning of the indirect (offering).
3.8.1.11.1	Then the Adhvaryū takes two blades of grass for the spread out Veda.
3.8.1.11.2	Having invoked (the deities), he says (to the Hotr), "Do thou invoke the offerings to the gods."
3.8.1.11.3	This is the Vaiśvadeva (rite) in connection with the animal sacrifice.
3.8.1.12.1	Then he recites, "O Revati, the sacrificer."
3.8.1.12.2	Revati is speech.
3.8.1.12.3	When speech speaks much, then it is Revati.
3.8.1.12.4	"May I enter the dear (place)."
3.8.1.12.5	He means to say, "May I enter without distress."
3.8.1.12.6	"From the sky, from the heaven, with the divine wind as my companion."
3.8.1.12.7	The wind blows through the space, which is rootless and cut off on both sides, just as this man, who is rootless and is cut off on both ends, moves through the space.
3.8.1.12.8	He says this: "May the wind protect him from the space."
3.8.1.13.1	"May I worship with this oblation and with my own self."
3.8.1.14.2	He strews the sacrificial grass for him, thinking, "May the oblation not be spilled."
3.8.1.14.3	Whatever of it spills while being cut, that remains in this (fire).
3.8.1.14.4	So that it does not become lost.
3.8.1.15.1	Then, having returned, they sit down facing the Āhavanīya fire, thinking, "Let us not be absent when he is being consecrated."
3.8.1.15.2	They do not strike it with a wedge.
3.8.1.15.3	It is human.
3.8.1.15.4	It is not the ear at the back.
3.8.1.15.5	It is divine.
3.8.1.15.6	They cover the face and make a veil.
3.8.1.15.7	They say, "Do not kill him."
3.8.1.15.8	It is human.
3.8.1.15.9	"He goes after the name."
3.8.1.15.10	It is divine,
3.8.1.15.11	When he says, "He goes after," he now follows the gods.
3.8.1.15.12	Therefore he says, "I have followed."
3.8.1.16.1	When they have pierced him, he offers before the announcement, saying, "Svāhā to the gods."
3.8.1.16.2	When he announces, "The animal is announced," then he offers, saying, "To the gods, svāhā."
3.8.1.16.3	Those who are offered to before are the other gods, and those who are offered to afterwards are the other gods.
3.8.1.16.4	He thus pleases them.
3.8.1.16.5	The gods, being pleased, carry him to the world of heaven.
3.8.1.16.6	These are the offerings that are heard.
3.8.1.16.7	If one wishes, one should offer them.
3.8.1.16.8	If one does not wish, one should not offer.
3.8.2.1.1	When the animal is announced, the Adhvaryu says, "O Nestr, lead the wife forward."
3.8.2.1.2	He leads her, the wife, carrying the water for drinking and rinsing,
3.8.2.2.1	He recites over her, "Salutations to the stretched-out one."
3.8.2.2.2	The sacrifice is stretched out.
3.8.2.2.3	For the sacrifice is stretched out,
3.8.2.2.4	and by that the sacrifice is stretched.
3.8.2.2.5	The wife is the half of the sacrifice.
3.8.2.2.6	He is now about to propitiate the sacrifice with her.
3.8.2.2.7	Therefore he makes this offering to the sacrifice.
3.8.2.3.5	The goddesses, the waters, are pure, are borne, are well-established among the gods, are well-settled among the gods, may we be well-established among them.
3.8.2.3.6	He indeed purifies it with water.
3.8.2.4.1	Then with water the wife touches the life-breaths of the animal.
3.8.2.4.2	When he touches the life-breath with water,
3.8.2.4.3	Life is the offering of the gods, immortality is the offering of those who are immortal.
3.8.2.4.4	Then when they kill the animal, when they sprinkle it, when they cut it up, when they cook it, when they offer it, when they eat it, then they offer it to the gods.
3.8.2.4.5	Water is the vital airs.
3.8.2.4.6	He places these vital airs in it.
3.8.2.4.7	Thus it becomes the living offering to the gods, the immortal to the immortals.
3.8.2.5.1	And when the wife touches it,
3.8.2.5.2	The wife is a woman.
3.8.2.5.3	These creatures are born from a woman.
3.8.2.5.4	He generates him for that woman.
3.8.2.5.5	Therefore the wife touches (the husband).
3.8.2.6.1	He touches the speech with the formula, "I purify your speech." He touches the mouth. "I purify your breath." He touches the nostrils. "I purify the eye." He touches the eyes. "I purify hearing." He touches the ears. "I purify navel." He touches the navel. "I purify that which is not named." He touches the penis. "I purify anus." He touches the anus. "I purify this posterior breath."
3.8.2.6.2	He places the breaths.
3.8.2.6.3	He makes it flow.
3.8.2.6.4	Then, having withdrawn, he says, "I purify the feet and conduct."
3.8.2.6.5	One stands firm by means of the feet.
3.8.2.6.6	By means of firmness, he establishes him.
3.8.2.7.1	Then with the remaining water, either half or as much as there is, the sacrificer and the head first sprinkle him.
3.8.2.7.2	Then they give him his breath and they blow him from here.
3.8.2.8.1	When they make him cruel and when they establish him, water is peace. They pacify him with water and peace.
3.8.2.8.2	They join him with water.
3.8.2.9.1	"They sprinkle the mind, it becomes nourished. The speech becomes nourished. The breath becomes nourished. The eye becomes nourished. The ear becomes nourished."
3.8.2.9.2	"They give the breaths."
3.8.2.9.3	"They make it flow. Whatever is cruel in you, whatever is settled, that becomes nourished and becomes purified."
3.8.2.10.1	Whatever they do to make it fierce, whatever they do to make firm, that is peace. With water, with peace, they pacify. With water, they join.
3.8.2.10.2	"That may be purified." They make it fit for sacrifice.
3.8.2.10.3	"They lead the animal towards the rear, saying, "May there be peace for the days."
3.8.2.11.1	When they make it cruel, when they make it firm, they do not want the days and nights to be without peace. Therefore, "for the sake of the peaceful days" (is said). They lead the animal towards the rear.
3.8.2.12.1	Then they cover the animal with a cloth.
3.8.2.12.2	He puts grass under it, saying, "O plant, protect me."
3.8.2.12.3	The knife is indeed a thunderbolt.
3.8.2.12.4	And indeed this thunderbolt-like axe does not injure him.
3.8.2.12.5	Then he places it with the axe, saying, "May it not injure him."
3.8.2.12.6	The axe is indeed a thunderbolt.
3.8.2.12.7	And indeed this thunderbolt-axe does not injure him,
3.8.2.13.1	He places it with that which is known as the altar.
3.8.2.13.2	That is indeed the sacrificial altar, prepared by the Yajus.
3.8.2.13.3	Whatever is the tip of the grass, he places on the left side.
3.8.2.13.4	Whatever is the root, he takes with the right side.
3.8.2.14.1	Where it is cut and where blood flows out, he anoints both sides, saying, "You are the share of the Rakshas."
3.8.2.14.2	For the Rakshas have a share in blood.
3.8.2.15.1	He stands over it, saying, "I stand over the Rakshas; I suppress the Rakshas, I lead the Rakshas to the lowest darkness."
3.8.2.15.2	Thus he suppresses the Rakshas with the sacrifice itself.
3.8.2.15.3	That it is rootless and enclosed on both sides,
3.8.2.16.2	With that he pours out the ladle and the spoon, saying, "May heaven and earth be poured out with ghee."
3.8.2.16.3	He thus bestows on these heaven and earth the energy and sap.
3.8.2.16.4	He places the energy and sap in them.
3.8.2.16.5	These creatures live on these, which are full of sap and nourishing.
3.8.2.17.1	The ladle and the spoon are made of wood of the Caru tree.
3.8.2.17.2	Where the gods first bound the animal, from that the oblation fell down when it was being ploughed towards the north.
3.8.2.17.3	That became the tree.
3.8.2.17.4	From that it fell down when it had been ploughed, therefore it is called Karṣmarya.
3.8.2.17.5	With that very oblation he makes it complete, he makes it whole.
3.8.2.17.6	Therefore the ladle and the spoon are made of Karṣmarya wood.
3.8.2.18.1	He makes her stay outside.
3.8.2.18.2	He heats her over the animal-sacrificial fire.
3.8.2.18.3	In this way she becomes cooked here also.
3.8.2.18.4	The Adhvaryu again takes up the torch.
3.8.2.18.5	They go towards the Cātvāla with their backs towards it.
3.8.2.18.6	They come to the Āhavanīya.
3.8.2.18.7	The Adhvaryu puts this grass on the Āhavanīy a with the verse, "O Vayu, the protector of the Stokas."
3.8.2.18.8	This is the fire-altar of the small ones.
3.8.2.19.1	Then standing on the north side he heats the omentum.
3.8.2.19.2	He who, having gone round on the right side, is about to roast the omentum, is about to transgress the fire.
3.8.2.19.3	Therefore he appeases it.
3.8.2.19.4	Thus indeed, this fire does not injure him who transgresses it.
3.8.2.19.5	Therefore standing on the north he heats the omenta.
3.8.2.20.1	They carry it between the sacrificial post and the fire.
3.8.2.20.2	Because they do not carry it along the same path by which they carry the other oblations, (they do so) lest they should approach the sacrifice with an unyoked (cart).
3.8.2.20.3	If they were to carry it outside the sacrificial post, they would make it outside the sacrifice.
3.8.2.20.4	Therefore they carry it between the post and the fire.
3.8.2.20.5	Having gone around along the right, the Pratiprasthātṛ cooks the oblation.
3.8.2.21.1	Then the Adhvaryu offers the Vapa with the ladle, saying, "May Agni consume the ghee, svāhā."
3.8.2.21.2	Thus indeed, those drops become offered, having been cooked and sanctified by svāhā.
3.8.2.22.1	Then he says, "Recite for the drops."
3.8.2.22.2	He recites the Agniya Stoka-hymns in the Stoka-hymn.
3.8.2.22.3	Why he recites the Agnija Stoka-hyms in the Stoka hymns?
3.8.2.22.4	The rain is given from here.
3.8.2.22.5	For from here Agni brings rain.
3.8.2.22.6	He brings these Stoka-hymans with these Stoka- hymns.
3.8.2.22.7	These Stoka-hyans rain.
3.8.2.22.8	Therefore he recites the Agnia Stoka-hymas in the Stokahymns.
3.8.2.22.9	When it is cooked,
3.8.2.23.1	then the Pratiprasthātṛ says, "The cooked has been brought."
3.8.2.23.2	Taking the two ladles, the Adhvaryu, having gone beyond (the fire), having announced, says, "Do you (O Hotṛ) recite for the Svadhākṛtis."
3.8.2.23.3	At the Vasat-utterance he offers.
3.8.2.24.1	Having offered, he first pours clarified butter over the Vapa, then over the Pṛṣadājya.
3.8.2.24.2	Now the Adhvaryus of the Carakas first pour the clarified butter on the cake, saying, "The clarified butter is the breath."
3.8.2.24.3	Now the Adhvaryu of the Carakas instructed Yajnavalkya while he was doing this.
3.8.2.24.4	"The Adhvaryu has gone within the breath."
3.8.2.24.5	"The breath will leave him."
3.8.2.25.1	He saw his arms and said, "These two arms are grey."
3.8.2.25.2	"Where did the Brahman's words go?"
3.8.2.25.3	One should not be concerned about it.
3.8.2.25.4	This is the best of the offerings.
3.8.2.25.5	This is indeed the oblation.
3.8.2.25.6	In the best of the sacrifices, one first pours clarified butter on the Dhruva vessel.
3.8.2.25.7	Because one is about to offer the first two portions of clarified butter to it.
3.8.2.25.8	If one is going to offer the Vapa first, then one should offer the Vapa.
3.8.2.25.9	Therefore one should first pour clarified butter over the Vapa and then over the Prshadājya.
3.8.2.25.10	If one does not pour clarified butter over an animal,
3.8.2.25.11	it is said, "One should not pour clarified butter on what is not cooked."
3.8.2.25.12	When one pours clarified butter over the animal, it is as if the entire animal has been poured over.
3.8.2.25.13	Therefore one should first pour the fat, then the clarified butter.
3.8.2.26.1	Then one sprinkles clarified butter.
3.8.2.26.2	And then he places a piece of gold.
3.8.2.26.3	Then, while cutting the fat, he says, "Recite for the fat of the goat to Agni and Soma."
3.8.2.26.4	Then he places a piece o gold.
3.8.2.27.7	Therefore, two pieces of gold are placed on either side.
3.8.2.27.8	Having announced, he says, "Send the goat's fat to Agni and Soma."
3.8.2.27.9	He says, "Not yet departed."
3.8.2.27.10	"The departed has departed."
3.8.2.27.11	He offers at the Vasat call.
3.8.2.28.1	Having offered the oblation, having properly prepared the oblation-spoon and the ladle, having placed them, he says, "Go to the wind in the upper sky, having offered to Svāhā."
3.8.2.28.2	"May these not be separated from the oblation by the two with which we have not offered the oblation."
3.8.2.29.1	The reason why they perform with the oblation-
3.8.2.29.2	The animal sacrifice is offered to a particular deity. By this oblation, he propitiates that deity.
3.8.2.29.3	This deity, being propitiated by this oblation, stops the subsequent oblations from being cooked.
3.8.2.29.4	Therefore, they perform with the Vayu-oblation.
3.8.2.30.1	Then they sprinkle themselves in the sacrificial pit.
3.8.2.30.2	They do a cruel thing when they bind (the animal) and when they kill it.
3.8.2.30.3	Water is peace.
3.8.2.30.4	They appease it with water and peace.
3.8.2.30.5	They join it with water.
3.8.2.30.6	Therefore they sprinkle it in the sacrificial enclosure.
3.8.3.1.1	He offers a cake to the deity to which the animal belongs.
3.8.3.1.2	Now when he offers the cake, it is the essence of all animals, for the Vrīhi and Yava are the essence of all the animals.
3.8.3.1.3	He thus makes him whole by that essence.
3.8.3.1.4	Therefore he offers the cake.
3.8.3.2.1	And when he performs with the cake after having performed with the oblation,
3.8.3.2.2	they dig out this oblation from the middle.
3.8.3.2.3	He thus makes him prosper with this very same sacrifice.
3.8.3.2.4	Therefore, having performed with the oblation of milk, he performs with this cake.
3.8.3.2.5	This is indeed his kinsman, wherever he may be.
3.8.3.2.6	This is the animal-cake which is offered in succession.
3.8.3.3.1	Then he cuts the animal into three parts, saying, "Cut it into three parts."
3.8.3.3.2	"May the supreme heart of him who has fallen three times be restored."
3.8.3.3.3	The sacrifice is threefold.
3.8.3.4.1	Then he instructs the Sāmitārin: "If he asks you, 'Is the offered oblation cooked?' say, 'It is cooked.' Do not say, 'It has not been cooked, O Blessed One, for it has not been cooked.'"
3.8.3.5.1	Then the Adhvaryu, having offered the clarified butter with the Juhu, having gone out, asks (the Hotṛ), "Is the oblation cooked? Is it cooled?"
3.8.3.5.2	He says, "It is cooked."
3.8.3.5.3	The Adhvaryu says, "It belongs to the gods."
3.8.3.6.1	When he asks,
3.8.3.6.2	the oblation of the gods is cooked, not uncooked.
3.8.3.6.3	He knows whether it is cooked or uncooked.
3.8.3.7.1	Now when he asks,
3.8.3.7.2	"Do you know the procedure?"
3.8.3.7.3	If it is not cooked, then the oblation of the gods becomes cooked, and the oblation of those who offer becomes cooked.
3.8.3.7.4	By this one becomes an Adhvaryu.
3.8.3.7.5	One becomes free from sin.
3.8.3.7.6	He asks three times.
3.8.3.7.7	The sacrifice is threefold.
3.8.3.7.8	And when he says, "That is the gods',"
3.8.3.7.9	That is the oblation of the gods.
3.8.3.7.10	Therefore he says, "That is the oblation for the gods."
3.8.3.8.1	He first pours clarified butter over the heart.
3.8.3.8.2	The mind is the heart, the self.
3.8.3.8.3	The vital breath is the clarified butter.
3.8.3.8.4	He places the vital breath in the mind, in the self.
3.8.3.8.5	Thus this oblation becomes the living oblation of the deities, the immortal oblation of the immortals.
3.8.3.9.1	He sprinkles it with the verse, "May your mind be united with mind, may your breath be united with breath."
3.8.3.9.2	He does not say "svāhā".
3.8.3.9.3	For this is not an offering.
3.8.3.9.4	They take out the animal.
3.8.3.10.1	They carry it between the sacrificial post and the fire, with its hind parts towards the Cātvāla.
3.8.3.10.2	Now, the reason why they do not take it with the Samyu-formula is that other oblations are taken with the Samyu formula. They do not want to perform the sacrifice with the flesh of an animal which has been killed with a sharp knife and which has been made cruel.
3.8.3.10.3	If they were to take it outside the sacrificial ground, they would be taking it outside the sacrifice.
3.8.3.10.4	Therefore they take it between the sacrificial post and the fire.
3.8.3.10.5	Having placed it on the right side, the Pratiprasthātṛ recites the formula.
3.8.3.10.6	The branches of the fig tree are the northern sacrificial grass.
3.8.3.10.7	He recites over them.
3.8.3.10.8	The reason why the branches of the fig-tree are the northern sacrificial-grass is this:
3.8.3.11.1	When the gods first bound the animal, Tvaṣṭṛ first cut it off from the head, thinking, "Thus we shall not be able to bind it."
3.8.3.11.2	For Tvaṣṭr is the owner of animals.
3.8.3.11.3	This is the head, the brain, and the marrow.
3.8.3.11.4	Therefore, it is like vomit.
3.8.3.11.5	For Tvashtra vomited it out.
3.8.3.11.6	Therefore, one should not eat it.
3.8.3.11.7	For this is what Tvashtra vomits out.
3.8.3.12.1	His wisdom fell down.
3.8.3.12.2	This became the tree.
3.8.3.12.3	The gods saw it.
3.8.3.12.4	Therefore, he is bright.
3.8.3.12.5	The name of this tree is well-known, namely, Plakṣa.
3.8.3.12.6	He thus makes him whole by means of that very intelligence.
3.8.3.12.7	Therefore the northern sacrificial grass is of Plakṣa wood.
3.8.3.13.1	Then he strews clarified butter on the Juhu and the Upabṛt, on the Vasahomi and the Havani, on the Samāvartdhana and the Dhānyā.
3.8.3.13.2	Then he puts two pieces of gold on the Juhu and the Upabhu.
3.8.3.14.1	Then he recites the Manota offering.
3.8.3.14.2	When he recites the offering to Manota,
3.8.3.14.3	all the deities approach the animal being offered, thinking, "He will take my name," "He will take mine."
3.8.3.14.4	For all the deities, the animal is the oblation.
3.8.3.14.5	The minds of all these deities are attached to the animal.
3.8.3.14.6	He thus delights them.
3.8.3.14.7	Thus the minds of the deities are attached to him without fail.
3.8.3.14.8	Therefore, the oblation is offered to Manota.
3.8.3.15.1	He first offers on the heart.
3.8.3.15.2	That which is in the middle, he offers in front of the heart.
3.8.3.15.3	The heart is indeed the vital breath.
3.8.3.15.4	For from here this upward vital breath moves.
3.8.3.15.5	The animal is indeed the vital breaths.
3.8.3.15.6	For as long as one breathes with the vital breaths, so long is one an animal.
3.8.3.15.7	But when the vital breath departs from it, then it lies like a log, useless.
3.8.3.16.1	The heart is the animal.
3.8.3.16.2	He offers it first of all to his own self.
3.8.3.16.3	Therefore, if any part of the offering is lost, one should not be distressed.
3.8.3.16.4	For the entire animal is offered in the heart.
3.8.3.16.5	He offers the heart first of all.
3.8.3.16.6	Therefore, from the middle of the animal, he offers the heart first.
3.8.3.16.7	Then as before.
3.8.3.17.1	Now for the tongue.
3.8.3.17.2	It is indeed established from the eastern half.
3.8.3.17.3	Now for the chest.
3.8.3.17.4	That is indeed from that.
3.8.3.17.5	Now for one-footedness of the thigh.
3.8.3.17.6	Now for both sides.
3.8.3.17.7	Now for what is sunken.
3.8.3.17.8	Now for two kidneys.
3.8.3.18.1	It makes the anus three-fold.
3.8.3.18.2	For the bones and the anus.
3.8.3.18.3	Having divided the middle of the Juhu into two, he offers.
3.8.3.18.4	The small one in the three limbs.
3.8.3.18.5	Then for the single-moving (goddess).
3.8.3.18.6	How much does one offer on the Juhu?
3.8.3.19.1	Then on the Upabhu.
3.8.3.19.2	Having cut the anus of the three-limbed (animal) into two, one offers.
3.8.3.19.3	For the three-limbs of the buttocks.
3.8.3.19.4	Then he places two gold pieces.
3.8.3.19.5	Then he pours clarified butter over it.
3.8.3.20.1	Then he takes up the Vasahomas, saying, "Red-colored."
3.8.3.20.2	For the red-colored one is like a young girl.
3.8.3.20.3	Therefore he says, "Red-coloured."
3.8.3.20.4	"May Agni protect you."
3.8.3.20.5	For Agni burns this.
3.8.3.20.6	Therefore he said, "May Agni protect you".
3.8.3.20.7	"May the waters have surrounded you."
3.8.3.20.8	The waters indeed gather the sap from the limbs.
3.8.3.20.9	Therefore he says, "The waters have gathered thee."
3.8.3.21.1	"With the swiftness of the wind," he says.
3.8.3.21.2	This one who blows follows the atmosphere.
3.8.3.21.3	He takes it for the atmosphere.
3.8.3.21.4	Therefore he (the Adhvaryu) says, "With the swiftness (of the wind) thee."
3.8.3.22.1	"Thou runnest with Pūṣan," he says.
3.8.3.22.2	This is indeed the speed of Pūṣan.
3.8.3.22.3	For from this (speed) he takes (the Soma).
3.8.3.22.4	Therefore he says, 'Of Pūṣan's speed.'
3.8.3.23.1	'Of the heat, the shining,'
3.8.3.23.2	This indeed is the heat.
3.8.3.23.3	For from the heat he takes (the soma).
3.8.3.23.4	Therefore he (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Of the heat, of the shining.'
3.8.3.23.5	Then twice he pours clarified butter over (the Soma).
3.8.3.24.1	Then he pours it out with the side of the ladle or with the Vasat-call, "Pouring out, I pour out hatred."
3.8.3.24.2	He thus drives away the evil spirits and Rakshas from here.
3.8.3.25.1	Then whatever is left over, he brings to the house of a woman who has a son.
3.8.3.25.2	He places the heart, the tongue, the breast, the liver, the lungs,
3.8.3.25.3	And then he pours clarified butter twice over the oblation.
3.8.3.26.1-7	The two gold plates are on either side of it. When they offer a sacrifice to Agni, they kill the animal. Gold is immortality and life. It stands firm in immortality and life. Thus it rises. Thus it revives. Therefore the two gold plates are placed on either side of the animal.
3.8.3.27.1	Now when he offers the oblation with the right eye, it is from the left and right cheeks, and from the left and the right buttock. Therefore this animal takes a step with the right eye.
3.8.3.27.2	If he were to offer the oblation properly, then this animal would take a step properly.
3.8.3.27.3	Therefore he offers with the right eye.
3.8.3.27.4	Now when he does not sprinkle the head, the shoulders, the neck, or the hind legs.
3.8.3.28.1	The Asuras indeed first bound a beast.
3.8.3.28.2	The gods, being afraid, did not approach it.
3.8.3.28.3	Then this earth said to them, "Do not be afraid.
3.8.3.28.4	I shall be the overseer of this, and as they will act with this, so they will act."
3.8.3.29.1	She said, "They offered one portion and left the other."
3.8.3.29.2	The portions that they left are these offerings.
3.8.3.29.3	Then the gods, at the Svishtakrit, took the three-limbed portions.
3.8.3.29.4	Therefore they are three-limbed.
3.8.3.29.5	Then the Asuras took the portions from the head, shoulders, neck, and the other thighs.
3.8.3.29.6	Therefore one should not blame them.
3.8.3.29.7	Since Tvashtri himself vomited out the Anooka, therefore one should not blame the Anooka.
3.8.3.29.8	Then he says, "Recite the Anushtubh verse for the Agni-Soma oblation of the goat."
3.8.3.29.9	Having called out, he says, "For the Agni-Soma offering of the goat, send forth the oblation."
3.8.3.29.10	He says, "Not yet started," and when it is started, he says, "
3.8.3.30.1	Between the two halves of the Yajus, he offers the Vasahomas.
3.8.3.30.2	This is the upward-moving intellect which has arisen from here, whose juice the creatures subsist on.
3.8.3.30.3	The Vasahomas are the juice of heaven.
3.8.3.30.4	The intellect is juice.
3.8.3.30.5	He thus intensifies the juice by means of juice.
3.8.3.30.6	Therefore this juice, when consumed, does not perish.
3.8.3.31.1-6	The reason why he offers the Vasahomas between the two half-verses is this. This (earth) is one half-verse. The sky is the other half-verse. The space between heaven and earth is the space. He offers to the space. Therefore he offers the Vasāhoma between the two half verses.
3.8.3.32.1	He offers ghee with the verse, "Those who drink ghee, drink fat, those who drink fat, drink the oblation of the atmosphere, svāhā."
3.8.3.32.2	He offers with this verse dedicated to Visvedevas.
3.8.3.32.3	The atmosphere is dedicated to Visvedeva.
3.8.3.32.4	In that these beings move along the atmosphere, breathing in and out, therefore it is dedicated to Visvedevā.
3.8.3.33.6	Soma indeed is the lord of plants.
3.8.3.33.7	He makes the animal Soma.
3.8.3.33.8	That he offers two oblations in between,
3.8.3.33.9	he pervades both.
3.8.3.33.10	Therefore he offers two oblatioins in between.
3.8.3.34.1	Then he says, "Bring the offerings from the Upabhrī vessel," and says, "Recite to Agni Svishtakrit."
3.8.3.34.2	Having called out, he says, "Do you offer to Agni Sviṣṭakṛt."
3.8.3.34.3	He offers at the Vasat-utterance.
3.8.3.35.1	Then with what remains of the Vasah-homa, he sprinkles the directions, saying, "To the directions, to the sub-directions, to the intermediate directions, to the upper directions, to the directions, svāhā."
3.8.3.35.2	The Vasah-homa is indeed the sap.
3.8.3.35.3	He thus places the sap in all the directions.
3.8.3.35.4	Therefore this juice is found in every direction.
3.8.3.36.1	Then he touches the animal.
3.8.3.36.2	Now is the time for touching.
3.8.3.36.3	If he were to touch it before, fearing that those who are standing near might be injured, if he were not to fear injury, he should touch it here.
3.8.3.37.1	Indra's breath has been placed in every limb.
3.8.3.37.2	The wind is the Indra, the Udanas are the treasures in the limbs.
3.8.3.37.3	When the limbs are cut off, he joins them with the Prāṇa and Udanas.
3.8.3.37.4	"O god Tvashtar, may thy abundance be well-proportioned, whatever form thou art."
3.8.3.37.5	He makes it complete.
3.8.3.37.6	"May thy friends, going to the gods, may thy mother and father rejoice in thee."
3.8.3.37.7	When he has made him whole, he unites him with the whole.
3.8.3.37.8	His whole self becomes in that world.
3.8.4.1.1	There are three kinds of animals, and eleven kinds of sacrifices.
3.8.4.1.2	Eleven are the Prayājas,
3.8.4.1.3	eleven Anuyājas,
3.8.4.1.4	and eleven Upayajas.
3.8.4.1.5	There are ten fingers on the hands and ten on the feet.
3.8.4.1.6	The ten vital airs are Prāṇa, Udāna, Vyāna.
3.8.4.1.7	This is the extent of man, the one who is the most excellent of animals, whom all animals follow.
3.8.4.2.1	They say, "What is done at the sacrifice by which Prāṇa is auspicious for all the limbs?"
3.8.4.3.1	What he does is to divide the anus into three parts.
3.8.4.3.2	The anus is Prāṇa.
3.8.4.3.3	It is directed towards the east.
3.8.4.5.2	If he is emaciated, then he should put the fat of the udder into the anus.
3.8.4.5.3	The anus is indeed the vital breath.
3.8.4.5.4	It is indeed the vital force that is in front.
3.8.4.5.5	This vital force follows it.
3.8.4.5.6	The animal is indeed the vital breaths.
3.8.4.5.7	As long as one breathes with the vital breaths, so long is one an animal.
3.8.4.5.8	Then when the breath departs from him, he lies like a log, useless.
3.8.4.6.1	The anus is the animal.
3.8.4.6.2	Fat is the sacrifice.
3.8.4.6.3	He offers it to him as the sacrifice.
3.8.4.6.4	If he is fat, then he has the sacrifice by himself.
3.8.4.7.1	Then he takes the clarified butter.
3.8.4.7.2	There are two things here, namely, ghee and curds.
3.8.4.7.3	The two are a pair, a begetting.
3.8.4.7.4	This is indeed a begetting of a pair.
3.8.4.8.1	He performs the Anuyājas with it.
3.8.4.8.2	The Anuyājas are indeed cattle.
3.8.4.8.3	Milk is the Pṛṣadājya.
3.8.4.8.4	He places milk in cattle.
3.8.4.8.5	This milk is placed in cattle.
3.8.4.9.5	Those two are the two vital breaths, the one above and the one below.
3.8.4.10.1	Now, this one makes the Vasat-call with both of them, to the Adhvaryu and to the one who offers the Upāṃśu.
3.8.4.10.2	And because he offers to one who is offering, therefore it is called Upāṃśuyaj.
3.8.4.10.3	And because one offers to one who offers, therefore it is the Upāṃshu.
3.8.4.10.4	And because it is offered after, therefore it is Upāṃshu.
3.8.4.10.5	Then indeed offspring are born to the female.
3.8.4.11.1	He offers with, "Go to the ocean, svāhā."
3.8.4.11.2	The ocean is indeed the waters.
3.8.4.11.3	The waters are semen.
3.8.4.11.4	He indeed sprinkles semen.
3.8.4.12.1	He offers, "Go to space, svāhā,"
3.8.4.12.2	For offspring are born following space.
3.8.4.12.3	He indeed generates offspring following space.
3.8.4.13.1	"Go to the god Savitr, svāhā"
3.8.4.13.2	Savitar is the impeller of the gods.
3.8.4.13.3	He indeed generates through the impulse of Savitar.
3.8.4.14.1	"Go, O Mitra-Varuna, to your own abode, svāhā."
3.8.4.14.2	Mitra-Varuna are the out-breath and in-breath.
3.8.4.14.3	He indeed places the out-breath, in-breath in the offspring.
3.8.4.15.1	"Go to the day and night, svāhā."
3.8.4.15.2	The offspring are born following the day and night.
3.8.4.15.3	He thus generates them in accordance with the day and night.
3.8.4.16.1	"He goes to the metres, svāhā."
3.8.4.16.2	There are seven metres.
3.8.4.16.3	There are seven domestic and seven wild animals.
3.8.4.16.4	He thus generates both of them.
3.8.4.17.1	"He says, "He goes to heaven and earth, svāhā."
3.8.4.17.2	Prajapati, having created the creatures, enclosed them within heaven and earth.
3.8.4.18.4	Now when he offers the Ati-Upāṃśu, he indeed generates it.
3.8.4.18.5	Therefore these creatures are born again and again.
3.8.5.1.1	He offers the Ati-Upaṃśu with the verse, "Go to the sacrifice, svāhā."
3.8.5.1.2	The sacrifice is indeed the waters.
3.8.5.1.3	The waters are semen.
3.8.5.1.4	He indeed pours down semen.
3.8.5.2.1	He offers with the verse, “Go to Soma, svāhā.”
3.8.5.2.2	Soma is indeed semen.
3.8.5.2.3	He pours down semen.
3.8.5.3.1	"Go to the divine sky, svāhā."
3.8.5.3.2	The waters are the divine sky.
3.8.5.3.3	The waters are semen.
3.8.5.3.4	He thus sprinkles semen.
3.8.5.4.1	"Go to Agni Vaisvānara, svāhā."
3.8.5.4.2	This earth is Agni Vaisvânara.
3.8.5.4.3	This is the support.
3.8.5.4.4	He thus generates this support.
3.8.5.5.1	Then, having examined the mouth, he says, "May my mind be in my heart."
3.8.5.5.2	Thus he makes himself firm and does not fall back.
3.8.5.6.1	Then they offer the wives with the Jaghanī (oblation).
3.8.5.6.2	The Jaghanī is half of the buttocks.
3.8.5.6.3	From the half of the buttocks, offspring are born to the woman.
3.8.5.6.4	That is indeed what is generated when they offer the wives through the Jaghanī.
3.8.5.7.1	Within the wives of the gods he offers.
3.8.5.7.2	Within the woman offspring are born.
3.8.5.7.3	Above for Agni, the lord of the house.
3.8.5.7.4	Above the bull runs over the woman.
3.8.5.8.1	Then they go to the Avabhrtha with the heart-piercing (oblation).
3.8.5.8.2	When a victim is being sacrificed, the heart of the animal is pierced by the arrow. From the heart, the arrow-wound.
3.8.5.8.3	And when they pierce the cooked (animal), it is not pierced by the arrow-wound (i.e. the wound is not fatal).
3.8.5.8.4	Therefore, one should pierce it only after it has been cooked.
3.8.5.8.5	When the animal has fallen three times, he takes out the heart and places it on the top.
3.8.5.9.1	Then he gives the arrow-wound.
3.8.5.9.2	Therefore, one should not throw it on the earth or in water.
3.8.5.9.3	If one were to throw it on the ground, it would enter the plants and trees.
3.8.5.9.4	If one throws it in water, it would enter that water.
3.8.5.9.5	Therefore, one should not do so on the earth or water.
3.8.5.10.1	One should throw it in water, where there is a junction of dry and wet, and collect it there.
3.8.5.10.2	If he should be exhausted for the purpose of going away, having offered a vessel of water in front of the sacrificial post, he buries it where there is a junction of dry and wet.
3.8.5.10.3	Thus he does not injure water or plants.
3.8.5.10.4	O king Varuna, from each of your realms, release us! We curse you, O Varuna, because they say that you are the punisher.
3.8.5.10.5	Then he says, "Varuna, release us."
3.8.5.10.6	Then he releases him from all the noose of Varuna, from all the nouse of Varuna.
3.8.5.11.1	Then he recites, "May the waters and plants be friendly to us, may they be unfriendly to him who hates us and whom we hate."
3.8.5.11.2	Where they move with this (oblation), the waters and plants stand apart from it.
3.8.5.11.3	He makes it friendly with them.
3.8.5.11.4	Then they enter him again.
3.8.5.11.5	This is the atonement there.
3.8.5.11.6	He does not perform the Agniṣomīya animal sacrifice, nor the Agnéya, but only the Vāśa animal sacrifice for the Anūbandhyā.
3.8.5.11.7	For all the sacrifices are performed in accordance with it.
3.8.5.11.8	This is the way of the Agniṣṭoma and the Agniṣṭomayajus animal sacrifice, and of the Agni animal sacrifice, when they perform the Vasa animal sacrifice.
3.9.1.1.1	Prajapati, creating the creatures, was afraid that they would be destroyed.
3.9.1.1.2	Therefore the creatures were beyond him.
3.9.1.1.3	His subjects did not stand for his prosperity and food.
3.9.1.2.1	He thought, "I am in the sky."
3.9.1.2.2	"I created you for my desire."
3.9.1.2.3	My desire was not fulfilled.
3.9.1.2.4	My subjects have become distant.
3.9.1.2.5	My subjects do not stand for my prosperity and food."
3.9.1.3.1	Prajapati thought, "How can I again nourish myself?
3.9.1.3.2	May my offspring return to me.
3.9.1.3.3	May my offspring stand for prosperity and food.'
3.9.1.4.1	He wandered, seeking offspring, while worshipping and resting.
3.9.1.4.2	He saw this Ekadashini (rite).
3.9.1.4.3	Having performed the Ekadashini rite, Prajapati again nourished himself.
3.9.1.4.4	His offspring returned to him.
3.9.1.5.6	To him one offers the Ekadashini sacrifice.
3.9.1.6.1	He first offers the animal to Agni.
3.9.1.6.2	Agni is the face of the gods, the begetter.
3.9.1.6.3	He is Prajapati.
3.9.1.6.4	He is the same as the sacrificer.
3.9.1.6.5	Therefore it is to Agni.
3.9.1.7.1	Then to Sarasvati.
3.9.1.7.2	Sarasvati is speech.
3.9.1.7.3	Through speech Prajapati again nourished himself.
3.9.1.7.4	Speech approached him.
3.9.1.7.5	He made speech the desire of his self.
3.9.1.7.6	He is indeed nourished by speech.
3.9.1.7.7	Speech approaches him.
3.9.1.7.8	He makes speech the desire of himself.
3.9.1.8.1	Now the Soma (rite).
3.9.1.8.2	Soma is indeed food.
3.9.1.8.3	By food indeed did Prajapati again nourish himself.
3.9.1.9.4	Therefore, he who is satisfied with speech, becomes the giver of food.
3.9.1.10.1	Then the Pousan (oblation).
3.9.1.10.2	Pusan is indeed cattle.
3.9.1.10.3	Prajapati again nourished himself with cattle.
3.9.1.10.4	Cattle returned to him.
3.9.1.10.5	He made cattle to be his own.
3.9.1.10.6	He nourishes himself with cattle.
3.9.1.10.7	The cattle approach him.
3.9.1.10.8	He makes the cattle follow him.
3.9.1.11.1	Then the one for Brhaspati.
3.9.1.11.2	Brhaspati is indeed Brahman.
3.9.1.11.3	Prajapati again nourished himself with Brahman.
3.9.1.11.4	Brahman approached him.
3.9.1.11.5	He made Brahman follow him.
3.9.1.11.6	This indeed is the nourishment of Brahman.
3.9.1.11.7	Brahman comes to him.
3.9.1.11.8	Brahman makes his own.
3.9.1.12.1	That which is in the form of Pusha,
3.9.1.12.2	Pusha is cattle.
3.9.1.12.3	Brihaspati is Brahman.
3.9.1.12.4	Therefore a Brahman is the most capable of cattle.
3.9.1.12.5	They are placed before him, placed at his mouth.
3.9.1.12.6	Therefore, having given all that, he wanders in a garment of deerskin.
3.9.1.13.1	Then the Visvedeva (offering).
3.9.1.13.2	All the Visve Devas are all.
3.9.1.13.3	Prajapati again nourished himself with all.
3.9.1.13.4	All turned towards him.
3.9.1.13.5	All made his body their own.
3.9.1.13.6	He nourishes himself with all.
3.9.1.13.7	Everything turns towards him.
3.9.1.13.8	He makes everything favorable to himself.
3.9.1.14.1	Whatever is in accordance with Brhaspati,
3.9.1.14.2	Brhaspati is indeed Brahman.
3.9.1.14.3	All this is the All-gods.
3.9.1.14.4	He makes this entire universe the mouth of Brahman.
3.9.1.14.5	Therefore, the mouth of this entire universe is the Brahman.
3.9.1.15.1	Then the Indra-related (verse).
3.9.1.15.2	Indra is the power of the senses.
3.9.1.15.3	Prajapati again nourished himself with the power of the sense-organs.
3.9.1.15.4	The power of the sense organs and the power returned to him.
3.9.1.15.5	He made his own power of the sense organ and power.
3.9.1.15.6	He is nourished by the power of the organs and power.
3.9.1.15.7	The power and power return to him.
3.9.1.17.5	The earth came to him.
3.9.1.17.6	He made the earth his own.
3.9.1.17.7	He is indeed nourished by the earth itself.
3.9.1.17.8	The earth comes to him.
3.9.1.17.9	One makes the earth one's own.
3.9.1.18.1	That it is followed by the Indra-rite,
3.9.1.18.2	Indra is the nobility.
3.9.1.18.3	The All-gods are the people.
3.9.1.18.4	The Maruts are the people.
3.9.1.18.5	This very Kshatra is being expanded by the Vishas.
3.9.1.18.6	This Kshatra is expanded by the Vishs on both sides.
3.9.1.19.1	Now the Indra-Agni (offering).
3.9.1.19.2	Agni is brilliance,
3.9.1.19.3	Indra is strength and energy.
3.9.1.19.4	Prajapati again nourished himself with both these energies.
3.9.1.19.5	Both these energies turn towards him.
3.9.1.20.3	Thus indeed, all his desires are fulfilled by the Savitr-impetus.
3.9.1.21.1	Then he offers the Varuna animal at the end.
3.9.1.21.2	It releases him from all the noose of Varuna, from all the Varuna-bondage.
3.9.1.22.1	Therefore, if the sacrificial post is eleven-fold, one should employ the Agni animal in the Agni-sthana.
3.9.1.22.2	Then one should place the others in order.
3.9.1.23.1	If the sacrifice is to be performed on the eleventh day, they should offer the sacrificial post dedicated to Agni first, and then the others in the order of the directions.
3.9.1.24.1	When they take them to the north, they take the one dedicated to Agni first and then the others.
3.9.1.25.1	When they are pierced, they pierce the one dedicated to Agni first, then the others, taking them towards the north and in the order of precedence.
3.9.1.26.1	When they perform with the omentum of those (animals), they perform with the one dedicated to Agn first, then with the others, in the order of their precedence.
3.9.1.27.1	Where they proceed, they proceed with the first one, namely, the Agniya, and then with the others in the order of sequence.
3.9.2.1.1	Where the head of the sacrifice was cut off, its juice flowed and entered the waters.
3.9.2.1.2	The waters flow with that very juice.
3.9.2.1.3	They think that it is that very juice which is flowing.
3.9.2.2.1	When he goes to the Vasatīvarī waters, he brings that very juice and places it in the sacrifice.
3.9.2.2.2	He makes the sacrifice juicy.
3.9.2.2.3	Therefore one goes to the Vasativari waters.
3.9.2.3.1	They are divided at all the pressing-rounds.
3.9.2.3.2	He thus places the juice at all the pressing rounds.
3.9.2.3.3	He makes all the pressing rounds juicy.
3.9.2.3.4	Therefore they are divided at all (pressing rounds).
3.9.2.4.1	He should take them from the flowing ones.
3.9.2.4.2	This is the essence of the sacrifice.
3.9.2.4.3	Therefore, he should take them from those flowing.
3.9.2.5.1	These are taken for the sake of protection.
3.9.2.5.2	Everything else here is protected, whatever moves here.
3.9.2.5.3	But these alone are not protected.
3.9.2.5.4	Therefore, one should take them from flowing ones.
3.9.2.6.1-7	"He should take it during the day, seeing (the sun), thinking, 'I am taking the essence of the sacrifice.' Therefore one should take it during daytime. He takes it for him who shines here. For he takes it for all the gods. For his rays are all the gods. Therefore one should take it in daytime. He is like the day.
3.9.2.6.8	Therefore one should take it during the day.
3.9.2.7.1	For this is what the Visve Devas do when they come to the sacrificer's house.
3.9.2.7.2	He who takes the Vasatīvarī waters before the sun has set, does so in order that he may be able to receive the guests with a prepared lodging.
3.9.2.7.3	They enter with this oblation.
3.9.2.7.4	They spend the night in these Vasatīvarīs.
3.9.2.7.5	That is the Upavasatha.
3.9.2.8.1	If one has not taken them up, then the expiation is performed there.
3.9.2.8.2	If the one who is to perform the sacrifice is present, one should take them up from the house.
3.9.2.8.3	For his, they have been taken up earlier in the day.
3.9.2.8.4	If the performer of the sacrifice is absent, one should take it from the house of one who is performing the sacrifice, whether he is present or absent.
3.9.2.8.5	For in the day they are taken.
3.9.2.9.1	If he finds neither of these, he should go with a torch.
3.9.2.9.2	He should take it, holding it above, or he should take gold, holding it above.
3.9.2.9.3	This is the form of that which shines.
3.9.2.11.2	The sacrifice is the Adhvara.
3.9.2.11.3	He makes it a sacrifice with oblations for the deity to whom he offers it.
3.9.2.11.4	Therefore, he says, "The deity with oblations is the Adhvarah."
3.9.2.12.1	"May the Sun be with oblations,"
3.9.2.12.2	he says, for he takes it for him who shines here.
3.9.2.12.3	For he takes it for all the deities.
3.9.2.12.4	For his rays are all the gods.
3.9.2.12.5	Therefore he says, "May the Sun be with oblations."
3.9.2.13.1	Having brought them, he places them behind the Garhapatya, saying, "I place you in the seat of Agni, the one with the house of serpents."
3.9.2.13.2	He means to say, "I place them in the seat of the one with the non-distressed house."
3.9.2.13.3	Then when the animal sacrifice to Agni-Soma is completed, he takes it away.
3.9.2.13.4	He says, "Let him go out."
3.9.2.13.5	The sacrificer sits down in front of the sacrificial post.
3.9.2.13.6	He takes them.
3.9.2.14.1	He goes out by the right side.
3.9.2.14.2	He places them on the right buttock with the formula, "You are the share of Indra and Agni."
3.9.2.14.3	For he takes them for all the gods.
3.9.2.14.4	Indra and Agni are indeed all the gods.
3.9.2.14.5	Having brought them back again, he places them in front of the wife.
3.9.2.14.6	He goes around the wife from the rear and takes them.
3.9.2.15.1	He goes out from the north.
3.9.2.15.2	He places them on the northern hip, saying, "You are the share of Mitra-Varuna."
3.9.2.15.3	One should not place them thus.
3.9.2.15.4	This is an excess.
3.9.2.15.5	One does not attain success thus.
3.9.2.15.6	He should say, "You are the share of Indra and Agni."
3.9.2.15.7	That is not excessive.
3.9.2.15.8	Thus prosperity is attained.
3.9.2.16.1	These are carried around for protection.
3.9.2.16.2	Agni is in front.
3.9.2.16.3	Then these are placed around, destroying the demons and the Rakshas.
3.9.2.16.4	He places them in the Agnidhra chamber, saying, "You are a share of all the gods."
3.9.2.16.5	He thus places all the gods in them.
3.9.2.16.6	These are indeed the best of the dwelling ones.
3.9.2.16.7	Therefore, it is called the best of the dwellings.
3.9.2.16.8	One who knows this indeed becomes the best of the dwellers.
3.9.2.17.1	These are the seven formulas.
3.9.2.17.2	With four he takes (the oblations).
3.9.2.17.3	With one he places the Garhapatya at the rear.
3.9.2.17.4	With one he removes (the oblations),
3.9.2.17.5	with one (verse) to the Agnidhra.
3.9.2.17.6	They are seven.
3.9.2.17.7	Where the verses of speech are born, the seven feet of the metres, the Sakvari is the last of them, they attain this (earth).
3.9.2.17.8	Therefore there are seven Yajus verses.
3.9.3.1.1	They awaken them.
3.9.3.1.2	Having touched the water, they approach the Agnidhra (priest).
3.9.3.1.3	He takes the butter-portions.
3.9.3.1.4	Having taken the clarified butter, they come (to the hall).
3.9.3.1.5	Having placed the clarified butter,
3.9.3.2.1	he then takes up the king (Soma).
3.9.3.2.2	This is the support of the offspring of these creatures.
3.9.3.2.3	He thus takes up this support.
3.9.3.2.4	He makes it his body.
3.9.3.2.5	He makes him his offspring.
3.9.3.3.1	He takes it up between (the two).
3.9.3.3.2	The sacrifice is the king.
3.9.3.3.3	He thus performs the sacrifices neither within nor without.
3.9.3.3.4	He places them in the troughs, facing each other.
3.9.3.3.5	Soma is the nobility;
3.9.3.3.6	the troughs are the people.
3.9.3.3.7	He thus places the nobility above the people.
3.9.3.3.8	And because they face each other, he makes the people face the nobility without dissension.
3.9.3.3.9	Therefore they face each other.
3.9.3.4.1	He takes it up with the formula, "For the heart thee, for the mind thee."
3.9.3.4.2	This is for the fulfilment of the sacrificer's desire.
3.9.3.4.3	For the sacrificer desires that desire with the heart and mind for which he sacrifices.
3.9.3.4.4	Therefore he says, "For the mind thee, for the heart thee."
3.9.3.5.1	"For the heaven thee, for the sun thee."
3.9.3.5.2	This means "for the world of gods thee."
3.9.3.5.3	He says, "To the heaven, to thee!" "To the sun, to thee!" He says this, "To the gods, to thee!"
3.9.3.5.4	"Place this sacrifice above in the heaven among the gods."
3.9.3.5.5	The sacrifice is indeed the Adhvara.
3.9.3.5.6	He says this, "Place this sacrifice above among the gods in the heaven."
3.9.3.6.1	"O Soma, O king, all these creatures have descended to thee."
3.9.3.7.6	Then he does it in the proper manner, as before. He says, "May all creatures descend upon you."
3.9.3.7.7	He makes him descend with these creatures.
3.9.3.7.8	Therefore, when a kshatriya approaches, these classes of people descend upon him.
3.9.3.7.9	They attend upon him below.
3.9.3.7.10	The Hotṛ, having approached, is about to recite the morning Prastara.
3.9.3.8.1	Then he places the kindling-wood, saying, "Recite to the gods the morning-hymns."
3.9.3.8.2	The gods are the morning-hymn-reciters.
3.9.3.8.3	The morning-hymn recitations are the Anuyaja offerings.
3.9.3.8.4	They perform the Anuyaja rites, saying, "For the gods, offer to the gods."
3.9.3.9.1	Some say, "Recite for the gods."
3.9.3.9.2	One should not say that.
3.9.3.9.3	The gods are the metres, the morning-pressing.
3.9.3.9.4	The metres are the Anuyājas.
3.9.3.9.5	They perform the Anuyāgas with the thought, "We shall offer to the gods after having sent them."
3.9.3.9.6	Therefore one should say, "Do thou recite to the gods, the morning-pressers."
3.9.3.10.1	And when he puts the kindling-wood, he kindles the metres.
3.9.3.10.2	Now when the Hotṛ recites the Prātaranuvāka, he thus again nourishes the metres and makes them not deficient.
3.9.3.10.3	The metres are deficient with the gods.
3.9.3.10.4	For the gods attained heaven by means of the metres.
3.9.3.10.5	Herein there is no praise or eulogy.
3.9.3.10.6	He thus again nourishes the metres and makes them not deficient.
3.9.3.10.7	With these not deficient (metres) they perform the sacrifice.
3.9.3.10.8	Therefore the Hotṛ recites the Prātaranuvāka.
3.9.3.11.1	They say, "Who is the respondent to the Prātaranuvaaka?"
3.9.3.11.2	The Adhvaryu should be awake.
3.9.3.11.3	When he blinks, that is his respondent.
3.9.3.11.4	He should not do it in that way.
3.9.3.11.5	If he sleeps, he should sleep with desire.
3.9.3.11.6	The ladle used for pouring the morning recitation is called "pracarani". Taking four spoonfuls of ghee in it, he offers.
3.9.3.12.1	Where the head of the sacrifice was cut off, its essence flowed and entered the water.
3.9.3.12.2	He brings it in the morning with the Vasatīvarī waters.
3.9.3.12.3	And whatever essence of the sacrifice remains here, he now takes that.
3.9.3.13.1	When he offers this oblation, he spreads over this essence of the sacrifice.
3.9.3.13.2	He obtains it.
3.9.3.13.3	And when he offers this oblation to these deities, he pleases them.
3.9.3.13.4	When they are satisfied and pleased, they bestow on him the essence of the sacrifice.
3.9.3.14.1	He offers with the verse, "May Agni listen to the invocation with the kindling wood."
3.9.3.14.2	He says, "May Agni hear this of mine, may he know this of mine."
3.9.3.14.3	Let the goddesses, the Waters, and the Goddesses of the Mind, listen.
3.9.3.14.4	Let the Waters listen to this of mine, and let them know it, is what he says.
3.9.3.14.5	Let the Stones, the knowers, listen to the sacrifice.
3.9.3.14.6	Let the stones listen to this of me, and let them be aware of it, is what is said.
3.9.3.14.7	Let the knowers listen to the sacrifice.
3.9.3.14.8	The wise are the stones.
3.9.3.14.9	"May the god Savitr hear my call, svāhā."
3.9.3.14.10	"May the God Savitr hear this of me." He means to say this.
3.9.3.14.11	Savitr is the impeller of the gods.
3.9.3.14.12	He thus takes the essence of the sacrifice impelled by Savitr.
3.9.3.15.1	Then, having taken up the four-fold ladleful of clarified butter, and moving towards the north, he says, "O Hotṛ, do thou desire (to recite)."
3.9.3.15.2	He says, "Do thou desire (to pronounce) O Hotṛ."
3.9.3.15.3	What the Hotṛ pronounces here, that he spreads over the essence of the sacrifice.
3.9.3.15.4	He obtains it.
3.9.3.15.5	And he does this in order to follow them, lest the evil spirits and demons should destroy them in between.
3.9.3.16.1	Then he gives the order: "O Maitrāvaruṇa and Camasādhvaryus, come!"
3.9.3.16.2	"O Nestr, lead the wives!"
3.9.3.16.3	"They are of one wealth."
3.9.3.16.4	"The Agnīdhra stands in the Catvāla with the Vasatīvarī waters and the Hotr's goblet."
3.9.3.16.5	This is the order.
3.9.3.17.1	They go out towards the north, with their backs towards the sacrificial post and their front towards the Āgnīdhra (shed).
3.9.3.17.2	They go to that direction where there is water.
3.9.3.17.3	They go with their wives.
3.9.3.17.4	The reason why they go with their wives is this.
3.9.3.18.1	When the head of the sacrifice was cut off, its juice flowed and entered the water.
3.9.3.18.2	The Gandharvas, the guardians of Soma, protected him.
3.9.3.19.1	The gods said, "This is indeed the danger here, that these Gandharvas are (here).
3.9.3.19.2	How can we bring the essence of the sacrifice to a place free from danger and danger?"
3.9.3.20.1	They said, "The Gandharvas are desirous of women.
3.9.3.20.2	We will come with our wives.
3.9.3.20.3	They will be attached to their wives.
3.9.3.20.4	Then they will bring the essence of the sacrifice to the place of safety and freedom from harm.
3.9.3.21.1	They went with their wives.
3.9.3.21.2	They were attached to their wives there.
3.9.3.21.3	Then they brought the essence of the sacrificial rite to the place of freedom from harm and safety.
3.9.3.22.1	In the same way, he goes with his wives.
3.9.3.22.2	The Gandharvas are attracted to the wives.
3.9.3.22.3	Then he brings the essence of the sacrifice to the place of safety, free from danger.
3.9.3.23.1	He offers it to the waters.
3.9.3.23.2	This is the oblation that is brought back, and the essence of the sacrificial offering comes together with it.
3.9.3.23.3	He stands up facing it.
3.9.3.23.4	He takes it after having revealed it.
3.9.3.24.1	When he offers this oblation, he spreads over this the essence of the sacrifice.
3.9.3.24.2	He obtains it.
3.9.3.24.3	He asks for water.
3.9.3.24.4	He offers this oblation to those very deities; he pleases them.
3.9.3.24.5	They, being satisfied and pleased with him, offer this essence of the sacrifice.
3.9.3.25.1	He offers, saying, "O divine waters, from the foot of the waters."
3.9.3.25.2	For the waters are indeed divine.
3.9.3.25.3	Therefore he says, "O divine Waters, from the foot."
3.9.3.25.4	"Which wave is sacrificial?"
3.9.3.25.5	He means to say, "Which wave is fit for sacrifice."
3.9.3.25.6	"The most powerful, the most intoxicating."
3.9.3.25.7	He says, 'Endowed with energy', meaning 'endowed with power'.
3.9.3.25.8	He says, 'Endowd with senses', meaning 'most excellent'.
3.9.3.25.9	He says 'He is given to the gods for the gods'.
3.9.3.25.10	He asks for him when he says, 'He is given for the gods for the god'.
3.9.3.25.11	He says to the bright ones.
3.9.3.25.12	Truth is bright.
3.9.3.25.13	He says, to the truthful ones, meaning 'to the truthful ones'.
3.9.3.25.14	"Those whose share is in the oblation, svāhā!"
3.9.3.25.15	For they indeed have a share in this.
3.9.3.26.1	Then with the Maitrāvaruṇa goblet he sprinkles this offering with the formula, "Thou art the sprinkling."
3.9.3.26.2	Just as a firebrand is sprinkled with fire, so this offering is sprinkled with this deity.
3.9.3.26.3	The king is sprinkled with these waters, which are in the Maitrāvaruṇa goblet.
3.9.3.26.4	The clarified butter is the thunderbolt.
3.9.3.26.5	Soma is the semen.
3.9.3.26.6	"One should not injure the semen with the thunderbolt and clarified butter."
3.9.3.26.7	Therefore he sprinkles it.
3.9.3.27.1	Then he takes it, saying, "I take you for the expanse of the ocean."
3.9.3.27.2	The ocean is the waters.
3.9.3.27.3	Herein he places the water in the earth.
3.9.3.27.4	Therefore the waters, though used in such a large extent, do not become exhausted.
3.9.3.27.5	They take the single-wealthy ones after that, and the ones with food and clothing.
3.9.3.28.1	In that he takes it in the Maitrāvaruṇa goblet,
3.9.3.28.2	Where the sacrifice had fled from the gods, the gods sought to win it back by means of their messengers.
3.9.3.28.3	They proclaimed it with the Purorucas.
3.9.3.28.4	They announced it with the Nividas.
3.9.3.28.5	Therefore one takes it in the Maitravaruna cup.
3.9.3.29.1	They come.
3.9.3.29.2	He stands up with the Agni-bricks, with the Vasatīvarī-waters and with the Hotr's goblet.
3.9.3.29.3	He touches the Catvāla-bricks one above the other, the Vasatīvari-waters and the Maitrāvaruṇa's goblet. "
3.9.3.29.4	"The waters have united with the waters, the plants with the plants."
3.9.3.29.5	And the essence of the sacrifice which was brought yesterday and that which is brought today, he thus unites them both.
3.9.3.30.1	Now, they take the Vasatīvarī waters to the Maitrāvaruṇa vessel, saying, "We are uniting both the Soma juice that was brought yesterday and that which is brought today."
3.9.3.30.2	But one should not do so.
3.9.3.30.3	Or, the essence of both the sacrifices is mixed together in the Adhavaniya vessel.
3.9.3.30.4	Then he takes the Vasatīvarī waters in the Hotr's goblet from the Nigra-waters.
3.9.3.30.5	When he touches the sacrificial post above and above, the gods then ascended to heaven from here.
3.9.3.30.6	He thus indicates to the sacrificer the path leading to heaven.
3.9.3.31.1	They come.
3.9.3.31.2	The Hotṛ asks the Adhvaryu, "Are the waters?"
3.9.3.31.3	He says, "The waters are."
3.9.3.31.4	The Adhvaryu replies, "The waters have been."
3.9.3.31.5	He says, "The waters have been and also they are mine."
3.9.3.32.1	If the Agniṣṭoma is performed, and if the remnants of the Soma-pressing are left over, and if they are sufficient for the Homa, then one should offer them.
3.9.3.32.2	If they are not sufficient for the Hota, then taking another four spoonfuls of clarified butter, one offers with the verse, "O Agni, you who are the mortal in battles, you who are praised in contests, you who are always the leader, svāhā!"
3.9.3.32.3	He offers in the Agniyesti.
3.9.3.32.4	Agni is the Agniṣṭoma.
3.9.3.32.5	He establishes the Agniṣṭomam in Agni.
3.9.3.32.6	With the mortal.
3.9.3.32.7	The Agniṣṭoma is equal to a man.
3.9.3.32.8	One should offer thus if there is an Agniṣṭoma sacrifice.
3.9.3.33.1	If there is an Ukthya sacrifice, one should touch the middle enclosing stick.
3.9.3.33.2	There are three enclosing sticks.
3.9.3.33.3	There are three Upavasatha days.
3.9.3.33.4	For it is by these that the sacrifice is established.
3.9.3.33.5	If there is an Atiratra or a Sodashi, one should not offer the oblation nor touch the middle enclosing stick.
3.9.3.33.6	One should go back silently and enter.
3.9.3.33.7	In this way one turns away from the sacrificial rites.
3.9.3.34.1	The Aṅgas and Aṅgas are one in number, three or five, five or seven, seven or nine, nine or eleven, eleven or thirteen, thirteen or fifteen.
3.9.3.34.2	The two are the pair, the begetting.
3.9.3.34.3	And that which is the one that remains over, that is the sacrificer's prosperity that remains over.
3.9.3.34.4	He alone is the one who has wealth, who surpasses the glory of the sacrificer.
3.9.3.34.5	Because he has wealth, they are called Ekadhanas (those with one wealth).
3.9.4.1.1	Then they sit down at the Adhiṣavaṇa (ceremony).
3.9.4.1.2	Then he binds gold on it.
3.9.4.1.3	There are two kinds here:
3.9.4.1.4	There is no third. Truth and untruth.
3.9.4.1.5	Truth is indeed the gods.
3.9.4.1.6	Untruth is indeed men.
3.9.4.1.7	Agni is the seed of gold.
3.9.4.1.8	Touch the rays with truth.
3.9.4.1.9	With truth, take away Soma.
3.9.4.1.10	Therefore, one binds gold here.
3.9.4.2.1	Then he takes up the stone.
3.9.4.2.2	Those stones are made of stone.
3.9.4.2.3	Soma is indeed a god.
3.9.4.2.4	For Soma is in heaven.
3.9.4.2.5	Soma was indeed Vritra.
3.9.4.2.6	His body is the mountains and the stones.
3.9.4.2.7	With his body he makes him whole, makes him complete.
3.9.4.2.8	Therefore they are made of stone.
3.9.4.2.9	They strike him when they sprinkle him.
3.9.4.2.10	They strike with this.
3.9.4.2.11	He rises up like that.
3.9.4.2.12	He revives like that.
3.9.4.2.13	Therefore the stones are made of stone.
3.9.4.3.1	He takes it with the formula, "I take thee in the impulse of Savitr, with the arms of Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, for the pressing."
3.9.4.3.2	Savitr indeed is the impeller of the gods.
3.9.4.3.3	He takes him impelled by Savitr.
3.9.4.3.4	With the arms of Aswins, he says.
3.9.4.3.5	Asvins are the Adhvaryus.
3.9.4.3.6	He takes it with the two arms of those two, not with his own.
3.9.4.3.7	"With the hands of Pusan."
3.9.4.3.8	Pusan is the milker of portions.
3.9.4.3.9	He takes it with the hands of him, not with his (own) hands.
3.9.4.3.10	This is indeed a thunderbolt.
3.9.4.3.11	No man is its bearer.
3.9.4.3.12	He takes this with these deities.
3.9.4.4.1	"He takes (it), saying, 'Thou art taken by the Ravasis."
3.9.4.4.2	When they sprinkle him with this (water), then it becomes an offering.
3.9.4.4.3	When he offers the oblation, then he gives the Dakṣiṇā.
3.9.4.4.4	For this is the pair of oblations and Dakṣiṇās.
3.9.4.4.5	Therefore he says, "Let us give."
3.9.4.5.1	"Make this sacrifice deep."
3.9.4.5.2	Sacrifice is indeed Yajña.
3.9.4.5.3-11	"Do thou make this great sacrifice." So he says. "To Indra, the well-pressed." Indra is the deity of the sacrifice. Therefore he says, "To Indra." "The well-pressed." He says, "The well-pressed" "With the best pressing." Soma is the best pressing. Therefore he say, "With the best pressing".
3.9.4.5.12	"May it be full of strength, honey, and milk."
3.9.4.5.13	He says this in the sense of "may it be full of juice" when he says "may it be strong, honey, and full of milk."
3.9.4.6.1	Then he restrains speech.
3.9.4.6.2	The gods, while performing the sacrifice, were afraid of being obstructed by the Asuras and Rakshas.
3.9.4.6.3	They said, "Let us perform the sacrifice in a low voice and restrain speech."
3.9.4.6.4	They performed the Upāṃśu sacrifice and controlled speech.
3.9.4.7.1	Then he offers the Nigrābha.
3.9.4.7.2	He makes them recite this: "May the gods, the Nigravas, satisfy me. May they satisfy my mind, my speech, my breath, my sight, my hearing, my self, my progeny, my cattle, my herds. May my herds not be thirsty."
3.9.4.7.3	The juice is water.
3.9.4.7.4	He prays for this blessing in them.
3.9.4.7.5	"May all my self be satisfied, may my progeny be satisfied, may the cattle be satisfied, may our groups be satisfied, may not our groups be thirsty."
3.9.4.7.6	He who is the Upāṃshusavana is indeed Vivasvan Aditya by means of the original.
3.9.4.7.7	This is his Vyāna.
3.9.4.8.1	He visualizes it.
3.9.4.8.2	They indeed kill him when they sprinkle him.
3.9.4.8.3	They kill him with this.
3.9.4.8.4	He rises thus.
3.9.4.8.5	He revives thus.
3.9.4.8.6	That he measures, therefore in the human world there is a measure, and whatever other measure there is.
3.9.4.9.1	He measures, 'For Indra thee, for the one with wealth, for the one protected by Rudra,' (saying this).
3.9.4.9.2	Indra indeed is the deity of the sacrifice.
3.9.4.9.3	Therefore he says, "To Indra, to thee."
3.9.4.9.4	"To the lord of wealth, to the lord of Rudra."
3.9.4.9.5	He thus shares Indra with the Vasus and the Rudras.
3.9.4.9.6	"To Indra, to the lord (of the Adityas), to thee."
3.9.4.9.7	He thus associates Indra with the Adityas.
3.9.4.9.8	"To thee, O Indra, the slayer of foes."
3.9.4.9.9	The foe is the slayer of foes.
3.9.4.9.10	"To Indra, the slayer of foes," thus indeed he says.
3.9.4.9.11	This is his release.
3.9.4.9.12	Just as the release of the best, so is this of him, except for the gods.
3.9.4.10.1	"To the hawk, the bearer of Soma," thus he says.
3.9.4.10.2	That he measures for the Gāyatrī.
3.9.4.10.3	"To Agni, the giver of wealth and nourishment," thus he says;
3.9.4.10.4	Agni is the Gāyatrīs.
3.9.4.10.5	That he makes for the Gāyatri.
3.9.4.10.6	When he, as a hawk, brought down the Soma from heaven, then it became a hawk, bearing Soma.
3.9.4.10.7	By that very power of it he measures the second time.
3.9.4.11.1	And when he measures five times,
3.9.4.11.2	The sacrifice is equal to a year.
3.9.4.11.3	There are five seasons in a year.
3.9.4.11.4	He attains it by five.
3.9.4.11.5	Therefore he measures five times.
3.9.4.12.1	He touches it with the formula, "Whatever light of yours is in heaven, whatever is on earth, whatever is in the sky, by that may this sacrificer be endowed with wealth and prosperity. I have told you the truth."
3.9.4.12.2	Where this (fire) first became the oblation of the gods, there he looked, thinking, 'May I not be the oblation of all the gods.'
3.9.4.12.3	He placed these three forms in these worlds.
3.9.4.13.1	The gods indeed attained it.
3.9.4.13.2	By means of this very (fire) they attained these forms.
3.9.4.14.3	By that very same power the waters flow.
3.9.4.14.4	Therefore, when they flow, he does not restrain them in any way.
3.9.4.14.5	They thought to themselves, "To whom should we go? By whom were we defeated?"
3.9.4.14.6	Everything here is Indra's abode, whatever there is, even this one who blows.
3.9.4.15.1	Indra said, "All this is my place, whatever there is."
3.9.4.15.2	"You all stand on my place."
3.9.4.15.3	They said, "What will be ours from that?"
3.9.4.15.4	"The first portion of Soma, the king."
3.9.4.15.5	"So be it."
3.9.4.15.6	They stood on it.
3.9.4.15.7	He placed them on his chest, on the place.
3.9.4.15.8	Because he placed them on his chest, therefore they are called Nigra-bhyas.
3.9.4.15.9	In the same way, the sacrificer places them on his chest.
3.9.4.15.10	This is the first portion of Soma, the king, which he offers with the Nigra-bhya.
3.9.4.16.1	He offers with the verse, "O ye waters, ye are the destroyers of the wicked."
3.9.4.16.2	Because the waters are auspicious.
3.9.4.16.3-10	Therefore he says, "O ye of the dog-like nature." "O ye of the Vritra-like nature." For they slew Vritra. "The wives of the immortal Radhas." For the waters are immortal. "Those goddesses lead this sacrifice to the gods." There is nothing hidden here. "Invited, drink Soma."
3.9.4.16.11	They eat the first portion of Soma, the king, after having invited him.
3.9.4.17.1	Then, when about to strike, he should mentally think of the one he hates, "I strike him, not you."
3.9.4.17.2	He who kills this human Brahman is indeed blamed.
3.9.4.17.3	But what if he kills this one?
3.9.4.17.4	Soma is indeed a god.
3.9.4.17.5	They kill him when they sprinkle him.
3.9.4.17.6	They kill him with this.
3.9.4.17.7	He rises thus.
3.9.4.17.8	He revives thus.
3.9.4.17.9	He becomes thus.
3.9.4.17.10	If he does not hate, he should mentally think of even grass.
3.9.4.17.11	He becomes so.
3.9.4.18.1	He strikes, saying, "Do not be afraid, do not be frightened."
3.9.4.18.2	Do not be afraid, do not be frightened.
3.9.4.18.3	He says this: "I strike at him, not at you."
3.9.4.18.4	"Preserve strength," he says.
3.9.4.18.5	He says, "Preserve sap."
3.9.4.18.6	"When you are firm, you should preserve strength."
3.9.4.18.7	They say that this is the same as the two fruits.
3.9.4.18.8	What is it that he who breaks these stones does?
3.9.4.18.9	These heaven and earth were agitated by this raised thunderbolt.
3.9.4.18.10	He appeases it with these heaven and earth.
3.9.4.18.11	Thus these are appeased and do not injure.
3.9.4.18.12	"He places them, saying, 'You place energy."
3.9.4.18.13	He says this, indeed, "You should place the Soma."
3.9.4.18.14	"Sin is slain, not Soma."
3.9.4.18.15	This (Soma) indeed, kills all his sins.
3.9.4.19.1	He presses it three times, takes it up three times, and approaches it four times.
3.9.4.19.2	That makes ten.
3.9.4.19.3	The Viraj has ten syllables.
3.9.4.19.4	Soma is Viraj.
3.9.4.19.5	Therefore, he makes it ten times.
3.9.4.20.1	Then he approaches the Nigraha.
3.9.4.20.2	"Where this (Soma) first became the oblation of the gods, there the gods placed the directions, saying, 'Let us touch these directions with the agreeable union of the two.'
3.9.4.20.3	The gods touched him with these directions, with the agreeable union, when they approached the Nigraha."
3.9.4.20.4	In the same way, he touches him with these directions and with the agreeable form of the pair. When he approaches the Nigraha.
3.9.4.21.1	He approaches the east, the west, the north, the south, from all directions, they run towards you.
3.9.4.21.2	He touches him with these quarters and with the agreeable nature of the pair.
3.9.4.21.3	"O Amba, let us be free from enemies, let us know each other."
3.9.4.21.4	A woman is Amba.
3.9.4.21.5	A woman is the directions.
3.9.4.21.6	Therefore he says, "O Amba let us be free."
3.9.4.21.7	"Let us know each other"
3.9.4.21.8	Enemies are offspring.
3.9.4.21.9	He means to say, "Let us know our offspring."
3.9.4.21.10	Therefore even those offspring who are far away know each other.
3.9.4.21.11	Therefore he says, "May I know the enemies."
3.9.4.22.1	And because he is called Soma.
3.9.4.22.2	When he first became the offering of the gods, he looked and thought, "May I not be the offering of the Gods with my entire self."
3.9.4.22.3	He put aside his most beloved form.
3.9.4.22.4	The gods found that.
3.9.4.22.5	They said, "Do you bring it near."
3.9.4.22.6	"Do not offer the oblation with it."
3.9.4.22.7	He brought it near from afar, saying, "This is mine."
3.9.4.22.8	Therefore, the name Soma.
3.9.4.23.1	And why the name Yajna?
3.9.4.23.2	They indeed slay him when they press him.
3.9.4.23.3	When they generate him, he is born, being supported.
3.9.4.23.4	He is called Yajñ because he is born from that.
3.9.4.23.5	Yajña is indeed the name of this (sacrifice).
3.9.4.24.1	There he also spoke this speech: "O Dev, you are the most powerful, O Indra, I praise you. There is none other than you, O Maghavan, in the mortal world. I am speaking these words to you."
3.9.4.24.2	This mortal man, indeed, said this: "You alone are the creator, not another than you."
3.9.4.25.1	Then he takes the cups of the Nigraha-cup.
3.9.4.25.2	The waters indeed slew Vritra.
3.9.4.25.3	By that very power the waters flow.
3.9.4.25.4	He takes the Vasatīvari cups from the flowing ones, and the Nigraha cups from the Vasatīvarī cups.
3.9.4.25.5	He seizes the Grahas from the Nigraha.
3.9.4.25.6	With that very energy he seizes the Graha from the Hotr's goblet.
3.9.4.25.7	The Hotr is a woman.
3.9.4.25.8	From the woman these creatures are born.
3.9.4.25.9	Then this woman, the Hotr, generates him from the Hotr’s goblet.
3.9.4.25.10	Therefore from the Hotrʼs goblet.
4.1.1.1.1	Prāṇa is indeed his Upāṃśu.
4.1.1.1.2	Vyāna is the Upāṃśusavana.
4.1.1.1.3	Udāna is indeed the Antaryāma.
4.1.1.2.1	Now, as to why it is called Upāṃśa.
4.1.1.2.2	Aṃśu is indeed the name of a cup.
4.1.1.2.3	That is Prajapati.
4.1.1.2.4	This is his breath.
4.1.1.2.5	Because this is his breath, therefore it is called Upāmśu.
4.1.1.3.1	He takes it outside the Bahiṣpavitra.
4.1.1.3.2	He places the Prāṇa in him, which is the most distant.
4.1.1.3.3	His Prāṇa is indeed the most distant. It is he who is crying.
4.1.1.3.4	He purifies it with the rays. It is purified.
4.1.1.3.5	He puricfies it with six.
4.1.1.3.6	There are six seasons.
4.1.1.3.7	He purifics it with the seasons.
4.1.1.4.1	They say that the Soma is purified by the Anśus, all Somas are purified by the Pavitra.
4.1.1.4.2	Then by what are the Anśus purified?
4.1.1.5.1	He puts them down with the formula, "To that thy name, O Soma, which is thy waking one, to that thy name, to that Soma, Svāhā."
4.1.1.5.2	Thus his Anśus are purified by the Svāhā-utterance.
4.1.1.5.3	This is the entire Soma-graha.
4.1.1.5.4	The form of all the Savanas.
4.1.1.6.1	The gods, while performing the sacrifice, were afraid of the Asuras and Rakshasas.
4.1.1.6.2	They said, "Let us establish the sacrifice."
4.1.1.6.3	If the Asuras and Raksasas were to attack us, the sacrifice would be established.
4.1.1.7.1	They established the entire sacrifice at the morning pressing itself, in this very cup, in the Yajus-form in the first Stotra, in the Sama-form in thefirst Sastra, in the Rk-form in the
4.1.1.7.2	With that settled sacrifice they proceeded.
4.1.1.7.3	This sacrifice is performed even now in the same way, in the same cup, with the Yajus in the first Stotra, with the Sama in the first Sastra, and with the Rk.
4.1.1.7.4	With this sacrifice performed, he proceeds further.
4.1.1.8.1	He sprinkles it eight times.
4.1.1.8.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
4.1.1.8.3	The morning pressing is Gayatri.
4.1.1.8.4	This is done at the morning pressing.
4.1.1.9.1	He takes it with the verse, "Do thou flow for Vācaspati."
4.1.1.9.2	Vācaspati is indeed the breath.
4.1.1.9.3	This is the breath as a cup.
4.1.1.9.4	Therefore he says, "Do thou (flow) for Vācaspatī."
4.1.1.9.5	"Purified by the rays of Vṛṣa,"
4.1.1.9.6	For he purifies him by the rays of Soma.
4.1.1.9.7	Therefore he says, "With the rays of the sun."
4.1.1.9.8	"Purified by the rays,"
4.1.1.9.9	the hands are the rays.
4.1.1.9.10	For it is with the hands that he purifies him.
4.1.1.10.1	Then he sprinkles eleven times.
4.1.1.10.2	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
4.1.1.10.3	The midday pressing is Tristubh.
4.1.1.10.4	This is indeed the midday pressing.
4.1.1.11.1	He takes it with the verse, "Do thou, O god, flow for the gods."
4.1.1.11.2	For he is indeed a god.
4.1.1.11.3	He flows for the gods.
4.1.1.11.4	For those whose share thou art."
4.1.1.11.5	For he indeed is their share.
4.1.1.12.1	Then he sprinkles it twelve times.
4.1.1.12.2	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
4.1.1.12.3	The third pressing is Jagati.
4.1.1.12.4	This indeed is the third pressing.
4.1.1.13.1	He takes it with the formula, "Make the honeyed (grasses) yield."
4.1.1.13.2	He thus places the juice in it.
4.1.1.13.3	He thus makes it tasty for the gods.
4.1.1.13.4	Therefore, when he is killed, he does not become putrid.
4.1.1.13.5	And when he offers, he thus establishes it.
4.1.1.14.1	They say that one should offer eight times for one who desires Brahmic glory.
4.1.1.14.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
4.1.1.14.3	Brahma is the Gayatri.
4.1.1.14.4	One indeed becomes Brahmic.
4.1.1.15.1	It is offered twenty-four times.
4.1.1.15.2	There are twenty-four half-months in a year.
4.1.1.15.3	Prajapati is the year.
4.1.1.15.4	Prajapati is the sacrifice.
4.1.1.15.5	He establishes it to the extent of the sacrifice and its measure.
4.1.1.16.1	They say, one should sprinkle five times five for one who desires cattle.
4.1.1.16.2	Cattle are fivefold.
4.1.1.16.3	One indeed obtains cattle.
4.1.1.16.4	There are five seasons in a year.
4.1.1.16.5	Prajapati is the year.
4.1.1.16.6	Prajapati is the sacrifice.
4.1.1.16.7	He establishes it at the extent of the sacrifice, at the extent of its measure.
4.1.1.16.8	This is indeed a discussion.
4.1.1.16.9	But the other one is done.
4.1.1.17.1	Taking it, he smears it, lest it should flow away.
4.1.1.17.2	He does not place it down.
4.1.1.17.3	For this is his breath.
4.1.1.17.4	Therefore this vital breath moves on.
4.1.1.17.5	If he should wander, then he should settle him.
4.1.1.17.6	"He says, "I settle you, O vital breath, of so-and-so." Thus it is."
4.1.1.17.7	There is no further existence for him whom he does not follow.
4.1.1.17.8	The Adhvaryu and the sacrificer live longer by that.
4.1.1.18.1	Or he should also place him, saying, "I place you, O vital breathing, of so- and-so.
4.1.1.18.2	Thus it is said.
4.1.1.18.3	In that there is nothing that he does not appease.
4.1.1.18.4	By that he does not covet life.
4.1.1.19.1	He offers it within himself with the word "svāhā."
4.1.1.19.2	The gods were afraid, thinking, "If the Asuras and Rakshasas do not destroy this sacrifice before it is offered, they will destroy us."
4.1.1.19.3	They offered it within themselves with the word "Svāhā".
4.1.1.20.2	The Rakshas moves in the sky, rootless and cut off on both sides, just as this man, rootless and severed on both sides, moves in the sky.
4.1.1.20.3	This indeed is the Brahmanic hymn that destroys the Rakshas.
4.1.1.20.4	With this he makes the sky free from fear and calamity.
4.1.1.21.1	Then he chooses a boon.
4.1.1.21.2	The gods, being strong, desire to offer this oblation.
4.1.1.21.3	They grant him this boon: "May he quickly offer this oblation."
4.1.1.21.4	Therefore one asks for a boon.
4.1.1.22.1	He offers, saying, "You are self-made."
4.1.1.22.2	This oblation is his breath.
4.1.1.22.3	It is self-made, self-born.
4.1.1.22.4	Therefore he says, "You are yourself made."
4.1.1.22.5	To all the divine and earthly senses.
4.1.1.22.6	For he is born of his own accord to all these creatures.
4.1.1.22.7	"O Mind, may I attain thee."
4.1.1.22.8	Prajapati is the mind.
4.1.1.22.9	He says this: "May Prajapati attain thee."
4.1.1.22.10	"Svāhā to thee, O Sun, for good existence."
4.1.1.22.11	He makes the Svāhā-form lower and the deity higher.
4.1.1.23.1	He has made him in the yonder heaven, who shines yonder.
4.1.1.23.2	He is all.
4.1.1.23.3	He makes him the most distant of all.
4.1.1.23.4	And if he were to make the deity inferior and the Svāhā-call superior, then indeed the Svāhā call would be superior to the yonder Aditya.
4.1.1.23.5	Therefore he makes the Svāhācall inferior and the deity superior.
4.1.1.24.1	Then having offered, he wipes the cup upwards.
4.1.1.24.2	He thus places the Prāṇa in him facing away.
4.1.1.24.3	Then with his hand stretched out, he wipes the middle enclosing stick towards the east.
4.1.1.24.4	He thus puts the Prāṇa facing away in him. "To the gods, to the Marīci-s, to you."
4.1.1.25.1	He placed it in this circle, namely, the sun that shines.
4.1.1.25.2	His rays are the gods, the rays of light.
4.1.1.25.3	He thus pleases them.
4.1.1.25.4	The gods, being pleased, carry him to heaven.
4.1.1.26.1	This cup has no Anuvākyā or Yājyā.
4.1.1.26.2	He offers it with a mantra.
4.1.1.26.3	By this he becomes one who has a companion in the recitation, by this one who has a partner in the sacrifice.
4.1.1.26.4	If one were to perform an exorcism, one should offer the hair of him who is entangled in the arms, or on the chest, or on the garment, with the verse, "The divine share, for whom it is, that is true. It is cut off above. He is killed by breaking. Phaḍ!"
4.1.1.26.5	Just as one would run away from those who are being killed, so does this (Soma) run away from those being pressed.
4.1.1.26.6	For he who does so, there is neither running nor not-running left.
4.1.1.26.7	He places it with the formula, "For thy breath."
4.1.1.26.8	For this is his breath.
4.1.1.27.1	Some place it on the southern half (of the altar), saying, "He moves along this direction."
4.1.1.27.2	He should not do it like that.
4.1.1.27.3	He should place it in the northern half only.
4.1.1.27.4	For there is no obstacle to this offering.
4.1.1.27.5	He places it with the formula, "For your breath."
4.1.1.27.6	For this is his breath.
4.1.1.28.1	Then he takes up the Upāṁsusavana.
4.1.1.28.2	He does not touch it with ten fingers or with a strainer.
4.1.1.28.3	For it is like water sprinkled.
4.1.1.28.4	If the Anusvara is embraced by the Panini, then one should add the Udana with the words "for the Vyana".
4.1.1.28.5	For this is his Vyana.
4.1.2.1.1	Indeed, the Anusvara (is) his Prāṇa, the Upāṃśu (is) his Vyāna, the Upāmsusavana (is) his Udana, and the Antaryama (is) his Udana.
4.1.2.2.1	And why is it called Antaryama?
4.1.2.2.2	He who is Prāṇa, he is Udana, he is Vyāna.
4.1.2.2.3	He places in him that same Prāṇa which is turned away, when he takes the Upāṃśu;
4.1.2.2.4	He places in him that very Udāna which is turned towards, when he takes Antaryāma;
4.1.2.2.5	This is his Udāna within the Self.
4.1.2.2.6	Therefore, that which is within him, and by which he controls these creatures, therefore, his name is Antaryama.
4.1.2.3.1	He takes it from the inner strainer.
4.1.2.3.2	He places the upward-moving breath in him, facing him.
4.1.2.3.3	This upward-moving breath of his is within the inner self.
4.1.2.3.4	By this the Upāṃśu Soma is taken from the Antaryāma Soma.
4.1.2.3.5	For both are similar, namely, the Upāṃshu and Antaryāma.
4.1.2.3.6	For the Prāṇa and Udāna are similar.
4.1.2.3.7	By this he also makes it free from blemish in the other cups.
4.1.2.4.1	And because he purifies the Soma with the filter,
4.1.2.4.2	Where Soma, having conquered his own priest Brihaspati, gave him back.
4.1.2.4.3	By that he was reconciled.
4.1.2.4.4	When he gave it back to him, the sin that remained was not removed. Then he thought of giving it to the knower of Brahman.
4.1.2.5.1	The gods purified him with the Pavitra.
4.1.2.5.2	He became fit, purified, and became the oblation of the gods.
4.1.2.5.3	In the same way, he purifies him with the purifying (water).
4.1.2.5.4	He becomes fit, purified, an oblation for the gods.
4.1.2.6.1	Now, when the Grahas are taken with the Upayāma,
4.1.2.6.2	this is Aditi.
4.1.2.6.3	Her oblation is the Prayaniya.
4.1.2.6.4	The oblation is the sun.
4.1.2.6.5	That is indeed the oblation before the Soma-pressing.
4.1.2.6.6	May she be the offering-cup in the gods' libations, and may she be mine in the offering-cup.
4.1.2.7.1	The gods said, "This sacrifice has been assigned to the deities.
4.1.2.7.2	You alone should take the Grahas.
4.1.2.7.3	They should be offered to the deities."
4.1.2.7.4	"So be it."
4.1.2.7.5	This is his share in the offering-cups.
4.1.2.8.1	When the Grahas are taken with the Upāṁśu-mantra,
4.1.2.8.2	This is the Upāṁśu.
4.1.2.8.3	This indeed takes this food for animals, men and trees.
4.1.2.8.4	The gods are above this.
4.1.2.8.5	For the gods are in heaven.
4.1.2.9.1	And when the Grahas are taken with the Upāṁshu, they are taken with this.
4.1.2.9.2	And when he places them in the Yoni, this is the womb of all this.
4.1.2.9.3	These creatures are born from her.
4.1.2.10.1	The priests carry Soma, which is the semen,
4.1.2.10.2	If semen is deposited in a place that is not the womb, it is lost.
4.1.2.10.3	But when it is deposited in the womb, it becomes established there.
4.1.2.11.1	The two Grahas of Prana and Udana are his.
4.1.2.11.2	When either of them rises, one should offer to the other. The two are explained in the form of exhalation and inhalation.
4.1.2.11.3	He explains the exhalation and inhalation as the two.
4.1.2.11.4	Therefore, though they are the same, they are called by different names, namely, Prāṇa and Udāna.
4.1.2.12.1	These two are his two Grahas (graspers) of day and night.
4.1.2.12.2	When either of them has risen, he offers to the other; for the purpose of determining the day and night.
4.1.2.12.3	He thus determines the day and night themselves.
4.1.2.13.1	He offers to the other when the day has set, in a low voice.
4.1.2.13.2	He thus places the day in the night.
4.1.2.13.3	Therefore even in the darkest night something is seen.
4.1.2.15.3	"Protect the Soma, O Maghavan!"
4.1.2.15.4	Indra is indeed Maghavan.
4.1.2.15.5	Indra is the leader of the sacrifice.
4.1.2.15.6	Therefore he says, "O Maghavan."
4.1.2.15.7	"Protect the Soma" means "Guard the Soma."
4.1.2.15.8	"Prosper, perform this sacrifice."
4.1.2.15.9	Cattle are indeed prosperity.
4.1.2.15.10	"Guard the cattle" means "Guard cattle."
4.1.2.15.11	"Do thou offer to the Iṣa."
4.1.2.15.12	The Iṣa is the offspring.
4.1.2.15.13	He makes them (the offspring) to be offered.
4.1.2.15.14	These offspring, the sacrificers, the worshippers, the toilers, move about.
4.1.2.16.1	"I place thee within the heaven and earth, I place thee within the firmament, with the gods below and above." Thus he makes him (the sacrificer) all-pervading.
4.1.2.16.2	Because by this (wind) these creatures move and breathe, and follow the sky, therefore it is Vaiśvadeva.
4.1.2.16.3	"O Maghavan, rejoice in the Antaryama!"
4.1.2.16.4	Maghavan is Indra.
4.1.2.16.5	Indra is the leader of the sacrifice.
4.1.2.16.6	Therefore he says, "O Maghavan."
4.1.2.16.7	Then when he takes it with the formula, "What is within, within," he means to say, "I place it within myself."
4.1.2.17.1	Having taken it, he smears it around, lest it should flow out.
4.1.2.17.2	He does not place it down.
4.1.2.17.3	For this is his Udanas.
4.1.2.17.4	Therefore this Udanas of his moves without being placed.
4.1.2.18.5	As is the case with the Upāṁśu and Antaryāma, so is the case with this.
4.1.2.18.6	For this is the same as the Upāṁshu and Antaryāmas.
4.1.2.18.7	For the Prāṇa and Udāna are the same.
4.1.2.19.1	The Carakas offer with different mantras, saying, "We make the Prāṇa-Udāna of him who has different powers."
4.1.2.19.2	One should not do so.
4.1.2.19.3	They confuse the sacrificer's Prāṇa and Uḍāna.
4.1.2.19.4	Or he may offer silently.
4.1.2.20.1	Whatever he offers silently with a mantra, that is offered with a mantra for him.
4.1.2.20.2	What is the use of offering silently?
4.1.2.20.3	Because the Upāṁśu and Antaryāma are the same.
4.1.2.20.4	For they are the Prāṇa and Apāna.
4.1.2.21.1	With the same mantra with which he offers, he offers this (oblation). "Thou art taken for all the divine and earthly senses. O mind, be thou mine. Svāhā. Be auspicious to the Sun."
4.1.2.21.2	The relation of the Yajus has been stated.
4.1.2.22.1	Having offered, he wipes off the cup facing east.
4.1.2.22.2	Having offered this Upāṃśu, he cleanses upwards.
4.1.2.22.3	Here he cleanses downwards.
4.1.2.22.4	He places the Uḍāna in him facing east.
4.1.2.23.1	Then with his hand lowered, he cleanses towards the west on the middle enclosing stick.
4.1.2.23.2	Having offered this Upāmshu, he cleanses to the east on the middle enclosing-stick with his hand stretched out.
4.1.2.23.3	Then here he cleans the lower part of the middle layer with his hand towards the west.
4.1.2.23.4	He places the Udanta (wind) in him towards the east, saying, "For the gods, for the rays."
4.1.2.23.5	That is indeed his own kinsman.
4.1.2.24.1	Having stepped back, he places it, saying, "To Udanta."
4.1.2.24.2	For this is his Udanta.
4.1.2.24.3	He places them touching each other.
4.1.2.24.4	He thus unites the Prāṇa and Udāna.
4.1.2.24.5	He unites the Prāṇas and Udānas.
4.1.2.25.1	They are not used from the third pressing onwards.
4.1.2.25.2	Therefore these men sleep.
4.1.2.25.3	They are again used at the third pressing.
4.1.2.25.4	Therefore these people wake up after sleeping.
4.1.2.25.5	They are the sharp and the dull.
4.1.2.25.6	This is indeed the form of the sacrifice.
4.1.2.25.7	The sacrifice is indeed performed like this.
4.1.2.25.8	Of it, the Upāṁśu and Antaryāma are the two wings, the Ātman is the Upāṁsusavana.
4.1.2.26.1	They are not sung until the third pressing.
4.1.2.26.2	The sacrifice stretches.
4.1.2.26.3	It indeed stretches when it reaches.
4.1.2.26.4	Therefore these birds fall with their wings spread out, not being able to fly.
4.1.2.26.5	They are again employed in the third pressing.
4.1.2.26.6	Therefore these birds fall with wings joined together, being able to fly,
4.1.2.26.7	following the course of the sacrifice.
4.1.2.27.1	This indeed is Upāṁshu.
4.1.2.27.2	For the breath is Upāṁśu.
4.1.2.27.3	For he breathes out towards this (earth).
4.1.2.27.4	This (earth) is the Antaryama.
4.1.2.27.5	For the Udanas are the Antaryama (s).
4.1.2.27.6	For he breathes up towards that (heaven).
4.1.2.27.7	The Upāmsusavana is the atmosphere.
4.1.2.27.8	For the Vyānas are the Upāmsusavanas.
4.1.2.27.9	For he breathes through the Vyānas towards the atmosphere.
4.1.3.1.1	The Indra-Vayu cup is his speech.
4.1.3.1.2	This is the inner (meaning).
4.1.3.1.3	When Indra struck Vritra with the thunderbolt, he, thinking himself weaker, and fearing as if he were thirsty, made a retreat.
4.1.3.1.4	The gods themselves made him retreat.
4.1.3.2.1	The Gods said: We do not know whether Vritra is dead or alive.
4.1.3.2.2	"Well, if one does not know whether Vritra is dead or alive,
4.1.3.3.1	they said to Vayu, "This is Vayu, who is blowing here."
4.1.3.3.2	"Vayu, you know this, whether Vritra has been killed or is alive."
4.1.3.3.3	You are the one who is not to be blamed.
4.1.3.3.4	If he is alive, you will quickly come back."
4.1.3.4.1	He said, "What will happen to me then?"
4.1.3.4.2	"At the first Vasat-call, O king Soma, you are the first."
4.1.3.4.3	"So be it," said Vayu.
4.1.3.4.4	"Strike Vritra."
4.1.3.4.5	He said, "Vritra is slain."
4.1.3.4.6	"Do what is to be done after slaying."
4.1.3.5.1	The gods then assembled.
4.1.3.5.2	"As if knowing the means of livelihood."
4.1.3.5.3	The one who was offered by one became a deity of one, the one who was offered to by two became a deity of two, the one who is offered to by many became a deity of many.
4.1.3.5.4	Because they offered him in vessels, therefore they are called Grahas.
4.1.3.6.1	He filled them.
4.1.3.6.2	He became rotten and stank.
4.1.3.6.3	He was not fit for offering, he was not fit for eating.
4.1.3.7.1	Those gods said to Vayu, "O Vayu, do you distribute this among us, do you make it agreeable to us."
4.1.3.7.2	He said, "What will be mine from it?"
4.1.3.7.3	"They will offer these vessels to you."
4.1.3.7.4	He said "So be it."
4.1.3.7.5	"But you will be my companion in the wind."
4.1.3.8.1	The gods removed as much of the smell as they could.
4.1.3.8.2	They placed him among the animals.
4.1.3.8.3	That is the smell of a corpse among animals.
4.1.3.8.4	Therefore one should not smell a corpse.
4.1.3.8.5	This is the smell of King Soma.
4.1.3.9.1	One should not spit.
4.1.3.9.2	Therefore, even if one thinks that one is attached, one should go away from the wind.
4.1.3.9.3	Soma is indeed prosperity.
4.1.3.9.4	Yaksma is sin.
4.1.3.9.5	Just as one would descend from a higher to a lower level for the sake of welfare, so does this consumption descend.
4.1.3.10.1	Then the wind carried the other one away.
4.1.3.10.2	It tasted good.
4.1.3.10.3	Then it was enough for the offering and enough for the meal.
4.1.3.10.4	Therefore, these are known as belonging to the different deities, and they are called "belonging to Vayu".
4.1.3.10.5	This is his first Vasat-call, and this is the first Vasat- call of King Soma.
4.1.3.10.6	These are the vessels which he mentions.
4.1.3.11.1	Indra thought: "Vayu is the most deserving of my sacrifice."
4.1.3.11.2	This is his first Vasatkāra, and this is his first Vasātkāra of King Soma. These are the vessels which are mentioned by him.
4.1.3.11.3	"I desire to be the slayer in this (rite)."
4.1.3.12.1	He said, "O Vayu, I desire to be the sharer in this rite."
4.1.3.12.2	What would happen then?
4.1.3.12.3	The speech would speak only what is well-defined.
4.1.3.12.4	If the speech speaks only what is well defined, then I will share with you."
4.1.3.12.5	Then this rite became the Indra-Vayu rite.
4.1.3.12.6	Vayu was indeed the one before that.
4.1.3.13.1	Indra said, "Half of this cup is mine."
4.1.3.13.2	"Only a quarter of it is yours," said Vayu.
4.1.3.13.3	Indra said, "Half is mine."
4.1.3.13.4	Vayu said, "Only a quarter of this is yours."
4.1.3.14.1	They went to Prajapati for a decision.
4.1.3.14.2	Prajapati divided the cup into two parts.
4.1.3.14.3	He said, "This is Vayu's."
4.1.3.14.4	Then he again divided the other half into two parts.
4.1.3.14.5	He said, "This is Vayu's."
4.1.3.14.6	He divided Indra's share into four parts, saying, "This is yours."
4.1.3.14.7	What is the fourth is the fourth.
4.1.3.14.8	Then this became the Indra-Turiya Graha.
4.1.3.15.1	This Graha has two Purorucas.
4.1.3.15.2	The former is Vayu and the latter is Indra-Vayu.
4.1.3.15.3	There are two Anuvakyas.
4.1.3.15.4	The former one is Vayu and latter one is Indra-Vyu.
4.1.3.15.5	There are two Prāṣas.
4.1.3.15.6	The Vāyavya is in the east, the Indra-Vāyavya in the north.
4.1.3.15.7	There are two Yājyās.
4.1.3.15.8	The Văyavya is again in the east, and the Indra-Văyavya in north.
4.1.3.15.9	Thus he divided him into four parts.
4.1.3.16.1	He said, "If you have divided me into four parts, then let the fourth part of speech be spoken."
4.1.3.16.2	This is the fourth kind of speech that is defined, which is spoken by men.
4.1.3.16.3	This is the fourth kind, which is undefined, which is spoken of by animals.
4.1.3.16.4	This is that fourth kind, which are undefined, which is uttered by birds.
4.1.3.16.5	This is what is called the fourth kind, undefined, which is the hissing of the small creeping things.
4.1.3.17.1	Therefore, this was spoken by the sages: "The words of speech are limited to four."
4.1.3.17.2	Those who know them are the learned Brahmanas.
4.1.3.17.3	Three are hidden and do not move.
4.1.3.17.4	The fourth is what humans speak.
4.1.3.18.1	Then he takes it up, saying, "O Vayu, do thou take up the pure-drinking one; a thousand of thy gifts, O universal-giver, have come to thee. I have come to thy Soma-drink, O god, which thou didst formerly give to Vayu."
4.1.3.19.1	Then, having taken it up, he brings it back, saying, "Indra and Vayu, these draughts have come to you.
4.1.3.19.2	The Indras praise you.
4.1.3.19.3	You are taken with the Upayāma formula, for Vāyu and Indra-Vāyu.
4.1.3.19.4	He places it with the formula, "This is your birthplace, for those who are in unison with you."
4.1.3.19.5	When he says, "For those who are in union with you,"
4.1.3.19.6	He who is Vayu is Indra.
4.1.3.19.7	He who is Indra is Vayu.
4.1.3.19.8	Therefore he says, "This is thy birthplace, for those in unison with thee."
4.1.4.1.1	Mitra and Varuna are indeed his two most excellent sacrifices.
4.1.4.1.2	This is indeed the inner (meaning).
4.1.4.1.3	Whatever he desires in his mind, "May this be mine, may I do this," that is indeed his sacrifice.
4.1.4.1.4	And whatever he accomplishes for him, that is his power.
4.1.4.1.5	Mitra indeed is sacrifice.
4.1.4.1.6	Varuna is power.
4.1.4.1.7	Brahman indeed is Mitra.
4.1.4.1.8	Kshatra is Varuna.
4.1.4.1.9	The Brahman alone is the one to be approached.
4.1.4.1.10	The Kṣatriya is the doer.
4.1.4.2.1	These two, Brahman and Kṣatriya, were indeed the first to live together.
4.1.4.2.2	Then Brahman alone was able to stand, apart from Kṣatriya and Varuna.
4.1.4.3.1	Kṣatriya was not able to stand, Varuna apart from Brahman and Mitra.
4.1.4.3.2	Whatever deed Varuna did, not sanctioned by Mitra, the Brahman, he did not succeed in it.
4.1.4.4.1	He said to Mitra, "O Varuna, I am going to do a deed. Do you sanction it."
4.1.4.4.2	"Let us join together."
4.1.4.4.3	"I shall place you in front."
4.1.4.4.4	"I am doing this deed with your sanction."
4.1.4.4.5	"So be it."
4.1.4.4.6	They joined together.
4.1.4.4.7	Then this became the Maitrāvaruṇa Graha.
4.1.4.5.1	He alone is the Purodha.
4.1.4.5.2	Therefore, a Brāhmaṇa should not desire to be the Purodha of a Kṣatriya as he does of all.
4.1.4.5.3	For these two create both good and evil.
4.1.4.5.4	A Kṣatriya should not have a Brāhmaṇā as his Purodha as he does of everyone.
4.1.4.5.5	For these create both good and bad.
4.1.4.5.6	Whatever deed Varuna performed after that, it was performed by Brahma, the creator, and Mitra. He indeed gave it to him.
4.1.4.6.1	That is indeed the prescribed (course of action) if a Brahmin becomes a non-king.
4.1.4.6.2	If he obtains a prosperous king, that is good.
4.1.4.6.3	But this is indeed the unprescribed (course of action), if a Kshatriya becomes a non-Brahmin.
4.1.4.6.4	Whatever deed he does, whether good or bad, it does not succeed for him, because it is not sanctioned by the Brahman.
4.1.4.6.5	Therefore, when a Kshatriya is about to perform a deed, he should approach a Brahmana.
4.1.4.6.6	Then that deed, sanctioned by the Brahman, succeeds for him.
4.1.4.7.1	Then he says, "This Soma, O Mitra and Varuna, is pressed by you, the sustainers of truth."
4.1.4.8.6	"He will not be a friend when he is not a friend."
4.1.4.8.7	"We will exclude you from the sacrifice."
4.1.4.8.8	"He said, 'I will kill.'
4.1.4.8.9	Therefore, when he was not a friend, he became an enemy."
4.1.4.8.10	He was deprived of cattle.
4.1.4.8.11	The gods restored him to cattle by giving him milk.
4.1.4.10.2	That cow, O Mitra-Varuna, do ye both bestow on us, not trembling, for all time.
4.1.4.10.3	He places her with the words, "This is thy place; for the two who are truthful."
4.1.4.10.4	When he says, "For the two who are truthfull,"
4.1.4.10.5	Truth is Brahman.
4.1.4.10.6	Mitra is Brahman.
4.1.4.10.7	For Brahman is truth.
4.1.4.10.8	Varuna is indeed life.
4.1.4.10.9	For Varuna is indeed the year.
4.1.4.10.10	The life-span is one year.
4.1.4.10.11	Therefore, he says, "This is your birthplace. For the truthful and the long-lived."
4.1.5.1.1	The ears are indeed his (Agni's) Asvins.
4.1.5.1.2	Therefore, one eats all around.
4.1.5.1.3	For one hears with all ears.
4.1.5.1.4	Where the Bhrigus and the Angiras attained heaven, that was the same as the old age of Chyavana, the Bhargava, or Chyavana, the Angiras.
4.1.5.2.1	The human Sharayata wandered about with a village.
4.1.5.2.2	He settled down in that very place.
4.1.5.2.3	His sons, playing, thought that this old man was useless and worthless, and pelted him with clods.
4.1.5.3.1	He became angry with the Sharayatas.
4.1.5.3.2	He declared them to be unworthy.
4.1.5.3.3	The father fought with the son, the brother with the brother.
4.1.5.4.1	Sharayata reflected: "What did I do that this calamity befell me?"
4.1.5.4.2	He called together the cowherds and the sheepherds and said:
4.1.5.5.1	He said, "Who among you saw anything here today?"
4.1.5.5.2	They said, "This old man, in the form of a duty, is lying down."
4.1.5.5.3	Thinking him to be useless, the boys pelted him with clods of earth."
4.1.5.5.4	He realized, "He is indeed Chyavana."
4.1.5.6.1	He yoked his chariot, placed his daughter Sukanyā in it, and drove off.
4.1.5.6.2	He came to the place where the sage was.
4.1.5.7.1	He said, "O sage, salutations to you.
4.1.5.7.2	I did not know you, so I harmed you.
4.1.5.7.3	This is Sukanyā.
4.1.5.7.4	I have made amends to you with her.
4.1.5.7.5	Please recognize my village."
4.1.5.7.6	Then and there his village became recognized.
4.1.5.9.3	She said, "I will not let him live whom my father gives me."
4.1.5.9.4	Then the sage came to know.
4.1.5.10.1	He said, "O Sukanya, what did they say to you?"
4.1.5.10.2	She explained it to him.
4.1.5.10.3	He, having been explained, said: "If you speak again, then you speak to me. You are not like the well-endowed, nor like the well-prosperous."
4.1.5.10.4	"Then you criticize my husband."
4.1.5.10.5	"If they say to you, 'How are we not well-endowed and well-prosperated?' then you speak to them: 'Make my young husband well again.'
4.1.5.10.6	Then I will tell you."
4.1.5.10.7	They approached her again.
4.1.5.10.8	She said to them,
4.1.5.11.1	"You are not at all well-provided, nor well-endowed."
4.1.5.11.2	"You are censuring my husband."
4.1.5.11.3	They said, "How are we not well-provided, how are we not wellendowed?"
4.1.5.11.4	She said, "Make my young husband again.
4.1.5.11.5	Then I will tell you."
4.1.5.12.1	They said, "Let us go to this lake."
4.1.5.12.2	"He will go by the age he desires."
4.1.5.12.3	He went to the lake.
4.1.5.12.4	He went by the age he desired.
4.1.5.13.1	They said, "O good daughters, by what means are we not all-knowing and not prosperous?"
4.1.5.13.2	Then Harṣī replied, "The gods are performing a sacrifice at Kurukṣetra."
4.1.5.13.3	They are excluding you from the sacrifice.
4.1.5.13.4	Therefore, you are not all-inclusive and not prosperous."
4.1.5.13.5	Then they went to the Ashvins from there.
4.1.5.13.6	They reached the gods performing the sacrifice, and they praised them in the Bahispavamāna (hymn).
4.1.5.14.1	They said, "Call us."
4.1.5.14.2	The gods said, "We will not call you."
4.1.5.14.3	"You have done much that is mixed with humans. You should heal."
4.1.5.15.1	They said, "Sacrifice with a head-less sacrifice."
4.1.5.15.2	"How is it head-less?"
4.1.5.15.3	"Call us."
4.1.5.15.4	Then they said, "We will tell you."
4.1.5.15.5	They said, "So be it."
4.1.5.15.6	They took this Graha of Asvins.
4.1.5.15.7	Those two became the Adhvaryus of the sacrifice.
4.1.5.15.8	They placed this head of the sacrifice back.
4.1.5.15.9	That is explained in the Brahmanas of the Divakirttis as to how they placed back the head of the sacrifice.
4.1.5.15.10	Therefore this Graha is taken at the Stuti of the Bahispavamāna.
4.1.5.15.11	For the Stuti of Bahispavamana has come.
4.1.5.16.1	They said, "We are the chief priests of the sacrifice, we are the Adhvaryus."
4.1.5.16.2	"Let us not take this Graha in front of them, but let us take the Grahas of the Dvidevatyas."
4.1.5.16.3	They took this Graha in the front of them, and took the Grahas of Dvidevatyās.
4.1.5.16.4	Therefore this tenth Graha is taken, and the third alone is consecrated with the Vasat-call.
4.1.5.16.5	Now as to why the two Asvins are mentioned.
4.1.5.16.6	These two, the heaven and the earth, are the Asvins in a direct sense.
4.1.5.16.7	For they have reached everything here.
4.1.5.16.8	The two with the lotus-garlands.
4.1.5.16.9	Agni is his lotus, and Aditya is hers.
4.1.5.17.1	Then indeed he takes it with the verse, "O ye two, O ye two, O Asvins, with the sweet-yielding whip, with the truth-yielding.
4.1.5.17.2	With that ye have mixed the sacrifice.
4.1.5.17.3	Taken with the offering-spoon, for the Asvins thee.
4.1.5.17.4	This is thy place, for the Madhu-yielding ones thee." So he places it.
4.1.5.17.5	He takes it with the Madhu-mati verse.
4.1.5.17.6	"For the Madhu- yielding ones thee" so he places it.
4.1.5.17.7	When he takes up the Madhumati verse, he settles it with the words, 'For thee who art sweet.'
4.1.5.18.1	Daidhyan Atharvana spoke to them the Brahman called Madhu.
4.1.5.18.2	That is their dear abode.
4.1.5.18.3	He approaches them with that very thing.
4.1.5.18.4	Therefore he takes up the verse Madhumati and settles it with the word 'For thee who are sweet.'
4.1.5.19.1	These are the smooth vessels.
4.1.5.19.2	The Rasnavam is the vessel for Indra-Vayu.
4.1.5.19.3	That is its second form.
4.1.5.19.4	That makes it a deity of two gods.
4.1.5.19.5	The Ajakavam is the vessel for Mitra-Varuna.
4.1.5.19.6	That is the second form of that.
4.1.5.19.7	That makes that a deity of two.
4.1.5.19.8	The Oṣṭham is the vessel for the Asvins.
4.1.5.19.9	That is their second form.
4.1.5.19.10	Therefore it is dedicated to the two gods.
4.1.5.19.11	Now, why is it called 'dedicated to the Ashvins'?
4.1.5.19.12	The Ashvins are the chief ones.
4.1.5.19.13	The mouth is like the lips.
4.1.5.19.14	Therefore the Ashvin vessel is made of lips.
4.2.1.1.1	The eyes are indeed his Shukra and Manthin.
4.2.1.1.2	This very one who shines is indeed Shukra.
4.2.1.1.3	And because this one shines, he is Shukra.
4.2.1.3.3	The first one is the one who is to be churned.
4.2.1.4.1	Of these two, the one who is being churned follows the other, and the other follows the one who is going to be churned;
4.2.1.4.2	The one who is being chumed follows the semen;
4.2.1.4.3	The one going to be churnhed follows the one who has been churned.
4.2.1.4.4	They are taken for another and offered to another.
4.2.1.4.5	"Shandama and Marica" are the demons and the Raksasas.
4.2.1.4.6	They are offered to the deities.
4.2.1.4.7	That is why it is so.
4.2.1.5.1	Where the gods killed the Asuras and Rakshasas, they were not able to kill them.
4.2.1.5.2	Whatever work the gods did, they would be confused and would soon flee again.
4.2.1.6.1	The gods said, "Let us find out how to kill them."
4.2.1.6.2	They said, "Let's seize them with the Grahas.
4.2.1.6.3	They were about to approach them.
4.2.1.6.4	"We will take them and kill them."
4.2.1.6.5	They took the two planets."
4.2.1.6.6	They approached them.
4.2.1.6.7	"They took them and killed them."
4.2.1.6.8	Therefore, they are taken as Śaṇḍa and Marīci, and offerings are made to the deities.
4.2.1.7.1	Yājñavalkya also said, "Should we not take them from the deities themselves?"
4.2.1.9.1	One should recite this very same verse of Sukra: "He who is the most excellent, the most ancient, the most universal, the most powerful, the most worthy of sacrifice, the most knowing of heaven, the most excellent, he is the most excellent."
4.2.1.9.2	For he is the most ancient.
4.2.1.9.3	For he is most excellent.
4.2.1.9.4	Therefore he says: "The most excellent, the worthy of sacrifice, knowing of heaven, turning towards the west, you milk the swift-moving, conquering one, following the one by whom you grow."
4.2.1.9.5	You are taken with the Upayāma formula. For Śaṇḍa (you are taken).
4.2.1.9.6	He places it with the formula, "This is your birthplace; protect the heroic nature."
4.2.1.9.7	For this is followed by the Self.
4.2.1.9.8	For the Self is heroic.
4.2.1.9.9	Therefore it is said, "This is thy birthplace; protect the hero nature."
4.2.1.9.10	He places it on the right side.
4.2.1.9.11	For this is the direction he follows.
4.2.1.10.1	Then he takes the Manthin (Soma). This Vena urged on Priyagrbha, the light-bearing, the womb of old age, in the chariot of the rays.
4.2.1.10.2	This child of the waters, at the confluence of the sun, the Brahmanas lick with their thoughts.
4.2.1.10.3	You are taken with the Upamantras for Maruts.
4.2.1.11.1	He grinds it with flour.
4.2.1.11.2	The reason why he grinds it with flours,
4.2.1.11.3	Varuna, indeed, was the one who had a close relationship with King Soma.
4.2.1.11.4	It became a horse.
4.2.1.11.5	Then it became a horse. 
4.2.1.11.6	Because it became a horse from being a horse, therefore it is called a horse.
4.2.1.11.7	Its tears flowed out.
4.2.1.11.8	Then it (became) barley.
4.2.1.11.9	Therefore they say, "Barley is of Varuna."
4.2.1.11.10	Now, whatever of his eye was lost, by that he makes it whole again, he makes it complete.
4.2.1.11.11	Therefore one should offer with flour.
4.2.1.12.1	He offers, saying, "The mind of those who are in the fierce offering, running with the sharp weapon, is subdued.
4.2.1.12.2	He who, with his rays, has subdued the direction and the light, the brave one, the strong one, the one who is to be praised."
4.2.1.12.3	"This is your womb, protect the creatures." He places it.
4.2.1.12.4	For this is the first of them.
4.2.1.12.5	For these are the first of the creatures, the classes.
4.2.1.12.6	Therefore he says, "This is your birthplace, protect the creatures".
4.2.1.13.1	There are two consecrated and two unconsecrated pieces of the sacrificial post.
4.2.1.13.2	The Adhvaryu takes up the consecrated and the unconsecrated.
4.2.1.13.3	In the same way, the Pratiprasthātṛ takes up both the consecrated and the unconsecrated (Soma).
4.2.1.13.4	The Adhvaryu takes up the bright (Soma), the Pratiprasthatṛ takes up the dark (Soma).
4.2.1.14.1	That Adhvaryu wipes off with the unconsecrated piece of the sacrificial post, saying, "Wiped off is the eunuch."
4.2.1.14.2	In the same way, that Pratiprasthātr wipes off, saying, "The impotent one is wiped off."
4.2.1.14.3	While taking them up, they are freed from the Asuras and Rakṣasas.
4.2.1.14.4	The Adhvaryu goes out with the formula, "May the gods lead thee with the Soma-juice." The Pratiprasthātṛ with the formula, “May the gods lead with the Manthin juice."
4.2.1.14.5	Thus they lead them to the deities.
4.2.1.15.1	They join the two with their heels touching the Āhavanīya.
4.2.1.15.2	They place them on the northern and southern parts of the altar.
4.2.1.15.3	The Adhvaryu places the fire on the southern half of the altar, the Pratiprasthātṛ follows him, saying, "Do not be unprotected."
4.2.1.15.4	They thus make the northern half of the altar unprotected by the Raksases.
4.2.1.15.5	They are going to go beyond the fire in the opposite direction.
4.2.1.15.6	Therefore they make it known to him.
4.2.1.15.7	Thus indeed, they are not harmed by Agni.
4.2.1.16.1	The Adhvaryu goes around, saying, "The hero, generating heroes, goes around."
4.2.1.16.2	For he is the one who follows him.
4.2.1.16.3	For a hero is the one who is followed.
4.2.1.16.4	Therefore he says, "The hero generating heroes goes around."
4.2.1.16.5	"Approaching the growth of wealth for the sacrificer."
4.2.1.16.6	He prays for the blessing of the sacrificer when he says, "With abundance of wealth and food, may the sacrificer prosper."
4.2.1.17.1	Then the Pratiprasthātṛ moves around, saying, "May the offspring be well-born, may the offspring be born."
4.2.1.17.2	Because this is the first (verse) for him.
4.2.1.17.3	Because these are the first (verses) for the offspring.
4.2.1.17.4	Therefore he says, "May the progeny be well-born."
4.2.1.17.5	"With abundance of wealth, may the sacrificers prosper."
4.2.1.17.6	He prays for the blessing of the sacrificer when he says, "May the sacrificer be blessed with prosperity."
4.2.1.18.1	Having covered them, they go out.
4.2.1.18.2	They do this to him (the sacrificer).
4.2.1.18.3	Therefore, these two, the sun and the moon, moving towards the east, no one sees.
4.2.1.18.4	Having gone around in front, they cover (the fire).
4.2.1.18.5	Standing in front, they offer.
4.2.1.19.2	If Agni were to burn, they should join the two ends of the rope in front of the sacrificial post.
4.2.1.19.3	The Adhvaryu says, "Shining together with the bright light of the day and the earth."
4.2.1.19.4	The Pratiprasthātṛ says, "Shining with the shining light of the day, the earth, and the bright light."
4.2.1.19.5	They make the two eyes shine.
4.2.1.19.6	He thus unites the eyes.
4.2.1.19.7	Therefore these two bones, the eyes, are united.
4.2.1.20.1	The Adhvaryu throws away the unsprinkled piece of wood, saying, "The outcast is thrown away."
4.2.1.20.2	In the same way the Pratiprasthātṛ throws away the piece of wood, (saying), "The outcast is cast away."
4.2.1.20.3	This was thrown away before the oblations, from the Asuras and Rakshas.
4.2.1.21.1	Then the Adhvaryu places the sprinkled Yūpa-wood on the Āhavaniya fire, saying, "Thou art the foundation of the bright (fire)."
4.2.1.21.2	In the same way the Pratiprasthātṛ places the foundation of the churning (fire), saying, "Thou are the foundation of the dark (fire)."
4.2.1.21.3	These are the two kindling woods of the eyes.
4.2.1.21.4	He kindles the eyes with these.
4.2.1.21.5	Therefore these eyes are kindled.
4.2.1.22.1	There he recites, "O Soma, the giver of uninterrupted, powerful, and prosperous wealth, may I be."
4.2.1.22.2	This is indeed a blessing for this rite.
4.2.1.22.3	He indeed seeks this blessing.
4.2.1.23.1	Then, having been announced, he says, "The Soma-offerings proceeding to Indra, the bright and sweet-flowing, are being sent forth for the morning Soma-pressing."
4.2.1.23.2	When the Adhvaryu makes the Vasat-call, the Pratiprasthātṛ makes the offering, and then the Camasādhvaryus.
4.2.1.24.1	They make the offerings while standing in front.
4.2.1.24.2	These two are the eyes.
4.2.1.24.3	They place the eyes in front.
4.2.1.24.4	Therefore the eyes are in front.
4.2.1.25.1	They make offerings while standing around the sacrificial post.
4.2.1.25.2	The sacrificial post is like the nose.
4.2.1.25.3	Therefore these two are on both sides of the nose.
4.2.1.26.1	They are offered with the Vasat-call, and are invoked with a mantra.
4.2.1.26.2	They obtain that by which they are invoked at every Soma-pressing.
4.2.1.26.3	That they are invoked at all Soma-pressings is because they are the most visible of Prajapati.
4.2.1.26.4	For these two are the eyes.
4.2.1.26.5	The eye is truth.
4.2.1.26.6	Prajapati indeed is the truth.
4.2.1.26.7	Therefore, one should offer oblations to both of them at all the Savanas.
4.2.1.27.1	He offers with the verse, "He offers, he is the first purification, he is the foremost of all, Varuna, Mitra, Agni, he is the most excellent, the healer, Brihaspati. Therefore, one should offer the Soma to Indra with Svāhā."
4.2.1.28.1	What he offers, that is the first, and he is the first. Indeed, the semen is always sprinkled.
4.2.1.28.2	The eyes are the first to be born.
4.2.1.28.3	Therefore he offers, saying, "This is the first, that is the first."
4.2.1.29.1	Then he orders, "Let the cup of the Hotri go forth, let the cup of the Brahman go forth, let those of the Udgātṛs go forth, let that of the sacrificer go forth.
4.2.1.29.2	Let the cups of the Hotr and the Sadasyas go forth.
4.2.1.29.3	Return.
4.2.1.29.4	Lift up the Soma."
4.2.1.29.5	This is the very same as the instruction.
4.2.1.29.6	The Pratiprasthātṛ pours the dripping fat into the Adhvaryu's vessel, having gone around.
4.2.1.29.7	He thus causes the first oblation to be given away.
4.2.1.29.8	The Adhvaryu pours it into the Hotr's goblet for consumption.
4.2.1.29.9	For the Vasat-utterer is the consumer.
4.2.1.29.10	The Vasat-utterance is indeed the breath.
4.2.1.29.11	He (the Adhvaryu) became as it were distant from this (sacrificer) who was uttering the Vasat-call.
4.2.1.29.12	The food is indeed the breath.
4.2.1.29.13	He again places the breath in himself.
4.2.1.30.1	And because they do not take these (cups) towards the west, they take other cups. For these (cups) are the eyes.
4.2.1.30.2	He pours the remnant into the Hotr's cup.
4.2.1.31.1	Then they take up the cups of the Hotras.
4.2.1.32.3	They satisfy them with this (oblation). "They are satisfied, pleased, and carry the sacrifice to the gods."
4.2.1.32.4	Therefore they perform the Hotr-rites.
4.2.1.33.1	He makes an offering either at the first or the last Hotr-rite, saying, "May the Hotr-offerings be satisfied with honey, those that are well-offered, well-pleased, well-offered, svāhā!"
4.2.2.1.4	Therefore he takes it with this (spoon).
4.2.2.1.5	For this is the vessel for it.
4.2.2.1.6	For he takes it with a vessel.
4.2.2.1.7	This (spoon) is all.
4.2.2.1.8	This cup is all.
4.2.2.1.9	Therefore he takes it with it.
4.2.2.2.1	He takes it full.
4.2.2.2.2	All is full.
4.2.2.2.3	This cup (is full).
4.2.2.2.4	Therefore he takes (it) full.
4.2.2.5.1	If he were to be a king, they would make him from that very (material), and would strengthen him from that.
4.2.2.5.2	The Āgrayaṇa is the Self.
4.2.2.5.3	From the Self all these limbs proceed.
4.2.2.5.4	From this (material) he takes the Graha at the end, the Hāriyojana.
4.2.2.5.5	In the Self, in this firm foundation, the sacrifice is established at the end.
4.2.2.6.1	And as to why it is called Āgrayaṇa,
4.2.2.6.2	The speech which he restrains when taking the Gravaṇī cup, he spoke it at the beginning.
4.2.2.6.3	Because he spoke it at that beginning, therefore it is called Āgrayana.
4.2.2.7.1	They restrained speech out of fear of the Rakṣas.
4.2.2.7.2	He takes six cups from here towards the east.
4.2.2.7.3	This is the seventh.
4.2.2.7.4	There are six seasons in a year.
4.2.2.7.5	The whole year is the sacrifice.
4.2.2.8.1	The gods spoke this speech in the conquered, fearless, uninjured, and unassailable world.
4.2.2.8.2	In the same way, he speaks this speech in the unconquered, fearless, unassailable, and unassail-able world.
4.2.2.9.1	Then he takes it up, saying, "The gods who are eleven in heaven, eleven on earth, eleven in the waters, eleven in the great, they, the gods, may enjoy this sacrifice. Taken with a formula, thou art the first-fruits, thou art the good first-fruits."
4.2.2.9.2	He thus makes speech not deficient.
4.2.2.10.2	"Protect the sacrifice" or "Protect the lord of sacrifice" - thus he addresses the speech that has been released.
4.2.2.10.3	"Protect the sacrificer" - thus he says.
4.2.2.10.4	For the sacrificer is the lord of sacrifice.
4.2.2.10.5	"May Vishnu protect you with his power; may you protect Vishnu" - thus he speaks to the speech that has thus been released.
4.2.2.10.6	For Vishnu is the sacrifice.
4.2.2.10.7	"May the sacrifice protect you with strength." Thus he says, releasing the speech, "Protect Vishnu."
4.2.2.10.8	"May you protect the sacrifice." Thus he says the cup, "Protect the pressing."
4.2.2.10.9	For this is the cup of all the pressings.
4.2.2.11.1	Then, taking up the ten-stringed filter, he utters the sound "hing."
4.2.2.11.2	This indeed is the speech that was not uttered.
4.2.2.11.3	In that speech, in the final part, the gods placed the vital breath with the sound "hiṅkāra".
4.2.2.11.4	The vital breath is indeed the sound "hińkāra".
4.2.2.11.5	For the vital breath is indeed "hiṅkāara".
4.2.2.11.6	Therefore, when one grasps it, one cannot make the sound "hiṃkāra" through the nostrils.
4.2.2.11.7	He united with that vital breath.
4.2.2.11.8	When one obtains that vital breath within, then one unites.
4.2.2.11.9	In the same way, he places the breath in the last part of speech, with the sound "hiṅ."
4.2.2.11.10	He breathes with that breath.
4.2.2.11.11	He makes the sound "hiṃ" three times.
4.2.2.11.12	The sacrifice is threefold.
4.2.2.12.1	Then he says, "Soma is flowing."
4.2.2.12.2	He who did not speak to her for fear of the Asuras and Rakshas, he now speaks to her in all the conquered, fearless, and uninjured regions.
4.2.2.12.3	He reveals her.
4.2.2.12.4	Therefore he says, "Soma is flowing."
4.2.2.13.1	"For this Brahman, for this Kshatra." Thus for Brahman and Kshatra.
4.2.2.13.2	"He pours for him who is offering, for the sacrificer." Thus he says to the sacrificer.
4.2.2.14.1	They say, "Having said this much, one should place (the Soma)."
4.2.2.14.2	This much is all, as far as Brahman, Kshatra and Vis,
4.2.2.14.3	Indra and Agni are all this.
4.2.2.14.4	Therefore, having said this much, he should place (the soma)."
4.2.2.15.1	He should say, "Do you flow for abundance and nourishment."
4.2.2.15.2	He says this for rain.
4.2.2.15.3	He says "nourishment" for the nourishment that comes from rain.
4.2.2.15.4	He flows for water and plants. This is for water and plants.
4.2.2.15.5	"He purifies for the heaven and earth" - he says this for the heaven and the earth, on which everything here is based.
4.2.2.15.6	"He purifies to the good one" - he says it for the good one.
4.2.2.16.1	Some say: "He purififies for the Brahmic glory."
4.2.2.16.2	One should not say that.
4.2.2.16.3	Or, what he says, "To him, the Brahman," that he says for the sake of the Brahman-splendour.
4.2.2.16.4	"To thee for all the gods, this is thy place for all the gods," he lays down.
4.2.2.16.5	For he takes him for all the gods.
4.2.2.16.6	He lays him down in the middle.
4.2.2.16.7	For this is his self.
4.2.2.16.8	For this self is as it were in the middle.
4.2.2.16.9	The Ukthya vessel is on the right, the Aditya vessel on the left.
4.2.3.1.1	This indeed is his unmentioned Self, namely the Ukthya.
4.2.3.1.2	This is his Self.
4.2.3.1.3	This is indeed his Self, the unmentioned breath.
4.2.3.1.4	This is verily his life.
4.2.3.1.5	Therefore he takes it with this (vessel).
4.2.3.1.6	For this is its vessel.
4.2.3.3.2	The Self is bound together by this (Soma). The joints are continuous.
4.2.3.3.3	Now, indeed, the last Soma-graha is taken up by the Acchāvāka without being grasped.
4.2.3.4.1	Then he takes up the king.
4.2.3.4.2	He pours down the third portion of the Soma-juice.
4.2.3.4.3	It reaches the joint.
4.2.3.4.4	He performs the first pressing of the later Savana and the last pressing of the earlier Savana.
4.2.3.4.5	Whatever he does for the later Savana, he does first; whatever he does for the earlier Savana, he performs last.
4.2.3.4.6	He arranges them in alternation.
4.2.3.4.7	Therefore these joints are arranged in alternation.
4.2.3.4.8	This is so and so, this is so and so.
4.2.3.5.1	In the same way in the midday Savana.
4.2.3.5.2	The last cup is taken by the Acchāvāka without being taken.
4.2.3.5.3	Then he pours down the third Vasatīvarī.
4.2.3.5.4	It reaches the joint.
4.2.3.5.5	He performs the first of the later Savana and the last of the earlier.
4.2.3.5.6	What is later, he performs first; what is earlier, he performs last.
4.2.3.5.7	He separates them.
4.2.3.5.8	Therefore these joints are separated.
4.2.3.5.9	This is the excess here, this is the excess here.
4.2.3.5.10	That by which his self is bound together, that is his life.
4.2.3.6.1	This is indeed the wish-yielding cow of Indra, the Uddhara.
4.2.3.6.2	He takes him away from three morning Savanas and three midday Savanas.
4.2.3.6.3	That makes six times.
4.2.3.6.4	There are six seasons.
4.2.3.6.5	The seasons cook all these desires.
4.2.3.7.7	They were indeed half of the Rg verses, half of the Yajus verses, and half of the Sama verses.
4.2.3.8.1	The gods said, "Let us place them in the Yajus."
4.2.3.8.2	So that this knowledge may become more abundant."
4.2.3.8.3	They placed them in the Yajur.
4.2.3.8.4	Then this knowledge became more abundant.
4.2.3.9.1-6	When he takes it as the Puroruk, for the Uktha is the Puroruk. The Puroruk is the Rik. The Uktha is the Rik. When he takes it away from the Ukthas, then indeed it becomes the Puroruk for him. Therefore he takes it as Puroruk.
4.2.3.10.1	Then he takes it up with, "Thou art taken with a support. For Indra thee, for the bountiful, for the prosperous."
4.2.3.10.2	Indra is the deity of the sacrifice.
4.2.3.10.3	Therefore he says, "For Indra thee."
4.2.3.10.4	"For the bountiful, the prosperous," he says, meaning "for the powerful."
4.2.3.10.5	"I take the Ukthya-cup."
4.2.3.10.6	For he takes him from the Utkhas.
4.2.3.10.7	"What is your great strength, O Indra," he says; it is as much as to say, "What is your great power, O Indra."
4.2.3.10.8	"To you, O Vishnu, to you."
4.2.3.10.9	For he takes him for the life of the sacrifice.
4.2.3.10.10	Therefore he says, "To you, O Vishņu, to you."
4.2.3.10.11	This is your place among the hymns. Thus he places it.
4.2.3.10.12	For he takes it from the hymns.
4.2.3.11.1	He takes it away, saying, "For the gods thee, for the divine sacrifice I take thee for life."
4.2.3.11.2	He who does so should exercise authority.
4.2.3.11.3	One should take it away according to the deity.
4.2.3.12.1	"I take thee for Mitra-Varuna, for the life of the sacrifice," thus to the Maitrāvaruṇa.
4.2.3.12.2	For the Maitrāvaruṇas praise him.
4.2.3.12.3	The Maitrāvaruṇā recites.
4.2.3.12.4	The Maiträvaruṇā offers.
4.2.3.13.1	"I take thee for Indra, for the life-breath of the sacrifice," to the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin.
4.2.3.13.2	For Indra is the deity of the Acchāvāka.
4.2.3.13.3	He recites the verses of Indra.
4.2.3.13.4	He offers the oblation to Indra.
4.2.3.14.1	"He says, "I take thee for Indra and Agni, for the life of the sacrifice, for the Acchāvakas."
4.2.3.14.2	For Indra and Agni are the deities of the Acchäväka.
4.2.3.14.3	He chants the verses of Indra and Agni.
4.2.3.14.4	He offers oblation to Indra and Agni.
4.2.3.14.5	"To Indra thee" at the midday pressing.
4.2.3.14.6	For the midday pressing is connected with Indra.
4.2.3.15.1	Now the Adhvaryus of the Caraka school take it up with the formula, "Thou art taken with a support; for the gods thee, for the divine praise, for the praiseworthy, for Mitra-Varuna, I take thee agreeable."
4.2.3.15.2	This is your birthplace. For Mitra and Varuna thee. He places it down.
4.2.3.15.3	"You are the offering again," he touches the pot.
4.2.3.16.1	"You have been taken for the offering. For the gods thee, for the divine praise thee, for the praises thee, I take thee agreeable to Indra. This is your birthplace." For Indra thee. He places down.
4.2.3.16.2	"Again you are the offering," he touches the vessel.
4.2.3.17.1	You are taken with the Upayāma formula. For the gods, for the divine Uktas, for Indra and Agni, I take (Soma) agreeable. This is your birthplace. For Indra and Agni thee. He places it (saying) thus.
4.2.3.17.2	"Do not be a sacrificial offering again." He touches the pot with this.
4.2.3.17.3	"For Indra thee, for Indra thee." Thus at the midday pressing.
4.2.3.17.4	The Madhyamdina Savana is indeed Indra's.
4.2.3.17.5	He touches the pot twice, saying, "The oblation is again yours."
4.2.3.17.6	He places the third one silently.
4.2.3.18.1	One should not take it with the Upāman, nor should one place it in the Yoni.
4.2.3.18.2	For indeed, this is taken with the Upāma first, and placed in the Yoni first for the sake of the son.
4.2.3.18.3	If he were to do it here, he would do it with the means of obtaining it, or he would place it in the womb.
4.2.3.18.4	Then when he touches the pot saying "You are the offering again", he is going to take the cup again.
4.2.3.18.5	One should not pay attention to it.
4.2.3.18.6	One should place it silently.
4.2.4.1.1	This indeed is his (Agni's) breath, which is in front. He is indeed Vaiśvānara.
4.2.4.1.2	And this one behind is Dhruva.
4.2.4.1.3	They used to take up these two Grahas first, Dhruva and Vaiśvānari.
4.2.4.1.4	Of them, now only one is taken, namely Dhruva.
4.2.4.1.5	If he were to hear it from the Charakas or from anywhere else, he should pour it into the cup of the sacrificer.
4.2.4.1.6	And this (cup) into the Hotr's cup.
4.2.4.2.1	What is below the navel of this (cup) is his (the Hotr's) self, and this is his life.
4.2.4.2.2	Therefore he takes it with this (cup).
4.2.4.2.3	For this is his pot.
4.2.4.4.2	The year is indeed Vaiśvānara.
4.2.4.4.3	The year is life.
4.2.4.4.4	Therefore one takes (the oblation) for Vaiśvānari.
4.2.4.5.1	He who is taken at the morning pressing sleeps from that time.
4.2.4.5.2	All the pressings lead him.
4.2.4.6.1	One should not lead him down when he is being praised.
4.2.4.6.2	The sacrificer should not live beyond a year if he were to bow down while being praised.
4.2.4.7.1	He bows down while being praised
4.2.4.7.2	He is led beyond the twelfth praise.
4.2.4.7.3	Thus he attains the life of the others in succession.
4.2.4.7.4	Thus the sacrificer lives longer.
4.2.4.7.5	Therefore a Brahman should be present at the Agniṣṭoma.
4.2.4.7.6	He should not move or spill the oblations of this (rite).
4.2.4.7.7	Thus one attains the entire span of life.
4.2.4.7.8	This is his life.
4.2.4.7.9	Thus one attains all the span of life. 
4.2.4.8.1	What is below his navel, that is his self.
4.2.4.8.2	If one were to move or spill before this oblation, one would certainly lose the oblation.
4.2.4.8.3	Therefore, one should not be too hasty in saying that the Soma-sacrifice is not a means of attaining heaven.
4.2.4.8.4	This is indeed true of the sacrificer himself.
4.2.4.8.5	For this is his own self.
4.2.4.9.1	He becomes one who has performed the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice.
4.2.4.9.2	Soma is indeed fame.
4.2.4.9.3	Therefore, those who obtain Soma and those who do not, both attain fame.
4.2.4.9.4	They come to see this.
4.2.4.9.5	That indeed is the glory, O Brahmanas, which, having spread, they take to themselves when they eat.
4.2.4.9.6	He who, knowing this, eats, indeed becomes glorious.
4.2.4.10.1	They indeed are the serpents, and the Agniṣṭoma is the day. Having placed the glory here, they move on. They become distant from the glory.
4.2.4.10.2	Having taken it around, he again takes the glory to himself.
4.2.4.10.3	Among them, he who knows this becomes the most famous and goes to heaven.
4.2.4.11.1	The gods and the Asuras, both of whom were born from Prajapati, competed in this sacrifice to Prajapati, their father, the year, saying, "This will be ours, this will be ours."
4.2.4.12.1	Then the gods, worshipping and striving, went forth.
4.2.4.12.2	They saw this Agniṣṭoma-day.
4.2.4.12.3	They completed the whole sacrifice with that Agniṣṭoma day.
4.2.4.12.4	They obstructed the Asuras from the sacrifice.
4.2.4.12.5	In the same way, he also completes the whole sacrifice with this Agniṣṭomadāy.
4.2.4.12.6	He obstructs his enemies from the sacrifice.
4.2.4.12.7	Therefore, it becomes like the Agniṣṭoma.
4.2.4.13.1	Having taken it, he places it on the northern Havirdhāna.
4.2.4.13.2	The Grahas are the vital breaths. He does not want to confuse the vital breaths.
4.2.4.13.3	He places the other Grahas on the scattered (grass), but this one, having arranged it, without covering it with grass.
4.2.4.14.1	Or, what is above the navel, that is his upper self. What is above the navel is indeed above. What is scattered is indeed above.
4.2.4.14.2	Therefore he places it on the scattered (grass). Then having spread this (grass) without covering it with grass.
4.2.4.15.1	What is below the navel, that belongs to his lower self.
4.2.4.15.2	That which is below the navel is indeed inferior.
4.2.4.15.3	That which is below the sacrificial grass is inferior.
4.2.4.15.4	Therefore he places it below the sacrificial grass.
4.2.4.16.1	This indeed is Prajapati, who is being performed as this sacrifice, from whom these beings have been created.
4.2.4.16.2	It is indeed from this that offspring are born even now.
4.2.4.16.3	Because he places them on the scattered (grass), therefore the offspring of those are born after them, and they stand in this world with another self.
4.2.4.16.4	Those who stand with the hooves stand in this world.
4.2.4.16.5	Now, when he lays down the grass without covering it with the sacrificial grass, therefore those beings are born after him, and those who stand in him by themselves, men and animals.
4.2.4.17.1	Now, when he covers it, he does something different from this.
4.2.4.17.2	The animals that are born from the animals that are placed on the ground, they stand in this world with their own bodies and with the horns.
4.2.4.18.1	They offer the cake on the Ahavaniya fire, the cooked rice, the gruel, the curds, the milk-rice.
4.2.4.18.2	It is as if one were to sprinkle water on one's face.
4.2.4.18.3	Then he lies down in one form, as if in water.
4.2.4.18.4	Therefore, whatever food of various kinds he eats with this mouth, he discharges with this breath as one kind, like water.
4.2.4.18.5	And because it is called Dhruva.
4.2.4.19.1	The gods, while performing the sacrifice, were afraid of being seized by the Asuras and Rakshasas.
4.2.4.19.2	They placed the Asuras and Rakshasas on the right side.
4.2.4.19.3	They struck these right-moving planets.
4.2.4.19.4	They also struck the right-moving sacrificial post.
4.2.4.19.5	But they could not pull it down.
4.2.4.19.6	The right-moving sacrificial posts became firm, and the left-moving sacrificial posts were pulled down.
4.2.4.19.7	Now, because they were not able to lift it up, therefore it is called Dhruva.
4.2.4.20.1	They protect it.
4.2.4.20.2	This is the head of this Gāyatrī.
4.2.4.20.3	The sacrifice is Gāyatrī,
4.2.4.20.4	twelve Stotras,
4.2.4.20.5	twelve Sastras,
4.2.4.20.6	that makes twenty-four.
4.2.4.20.7	The Gāyatrī has twenty-four syllables,
4.2.4.20.8	this is its head.
4.2.4.21.2	The sacrifice is the Gāyatrī.
4.2.4.21.3	There are twelve Stotras.
4.2.4.21.4	There are twelves Sastras.
4.2.4.21.5	That makes twenty-four.
4.2.4.21.6	The Gāyatrī has twenty-four syllables.
4.2.4.21.7	This is its calf.
4.2.4.21.8	They protect it, for they protect these calves for milking.
4.2.4.21.9	This is the way the cow gives milk. This is the way this Gāyatrī gives all desires to the sacrificer. Therefore, they protect the cow.
4.2.4.22.1	Then when the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthātṛ go out and come in, it is as if one would treat a calf that is tied.
4.2.4.22.2	They approach this cup.
4.2.4.22.3	He pours it down.
4.2.4.22.4	This causes the Gāyatrī to flow.
4.2.4.22.5	This Gayatri is given to the sacrificer, she gives all desires. Therefore he pours it down.
4.2.4.23.1	He pours it down with the verse, "I pour down Soma with the firm mind and speech." Or he may say, "Indra has made our clans free from enemies and of one mind."
4.2.4.23.2	"Just as Indra, so may these classes of people be united in their minds for prosperity, fame, food, and the absence of enemies." Thus he says.
4.2.4.24.1	Then he takes the head of heaven, the desire of earth, the all-encompassing Agni, born in the truth.
4.2.4.24.2	The wise, the sovereign, the guest of men, the near vessel, the gods generate.
4.2.4.24.3	You are taken with the Upayāma formula. You are firm, you are the firm earth, the most firm of the firm, the most firm earth of the unmoving. This is your birthplace. For Vaisvānara you. Having spread out, he places it without covering with grass.
4.2.4.24.4	For he takes him for Vaisvānari.
4.2.5.1.1	Having taken the Grahas, he goes out and offers the oblation of drops.
4.2.5.1.2	Now, why he offers the oblation to the drops.
4.2.5.1.3	The drops that fall here, he makes them his own in the Ahavaniya.
4.2.5.1.4	For the Ahavaniya is the support of the oblations.
4.2.5.1.5	Therefore he offers the oblations to the drops.
4.2.5.2.1	He offers with the verse, "O Drop, whatever of thine falls down, whatever of thine is the ray."
4.2.5.2.2	What falls down in small quantities is the drop.
4.2.5.2.3	He says this to him.
4.2.5.2.4	"Whatever of thine is the Ray" - he says this to the Ray.
4.2.5.2.5	"Fallen from the pressing stones, from the place of the Adhishvana."
4.2.5.2.6	It falls down from the pressing stones and from the place of Adhishvana.
4.2.5.2.7	"From the strainer or from the Adhvaryu's side."
4.2.5.2.8	It falls from the Adhvaryu's hands or from the strainer.
4.2.5.2.9	"He offers it with the formula, "I offer this to thee with the mind, with Vasat and Svāhā."
4.2.5.2.10	"Just as what is offered with Vasat becomes offered, so does this become."
4.2.5.3.1	The Adhvaryu takes two blades of grass for the spread out Veda.
4.2.5.3.2	The two Adhvaryus are the first to be appointed, the Prāṇa and Udāna of the sacrifice; then the Prastôtṛ, the voice of the sacrifice; the Udgâtri, the Self, the Prajapati of the sacrifice; and the Pratihartri, the physician or the Vyâna.
4.2.5.4.1	These five priests the sacrificer follows.
4.2.5.4.2	This is the whole sacrifice, as far as these five priests go.
4.2.5.4.3	The sacrifice is fivefold.
4.2.5.4.4	He thus follows the sacrifice.
4.2.5.5.1	Then he throws a blade of grass towards the Catvāla, saying, "Thou art the ascent of the gods."
4.2.5.5.2	Where the gods attained heaven by means of the sacrifice, they ascended from this Catvāla to heaven.
4.2.5.5.3	He thus points out to the sacrificer the path leading to heaven.
4.2.5.6.1	Then he places a blade of grass before the Udgātṛs, silently.
4.2.5.6.2	The Udgātṛ is indeed Prajapati, the Stoma.
4.2.5.6.3	He has created all this.
4.2.5.6.4	All this is produced from him.
4.2.5.6.5	Therefore he places that blade of grass.
4.2.5.6.6	So he does not join the Adhvaryu.
4.2.5.6.7	He does not succeed.
4.2.5.6.8	When they recite, the Udgātṛs recite here.
4.2.5.7.1	Then he begins the Stotra with "Soma is flowing".
4.2.5.7.2	He begins the Stotra only after the Parāgas.
4.2.5.7.3	He praises the Parāgas only.
4.2.5.7.4	These Stotras are turned towards the gods, namely the Pavamāna Stotras.
4.2.5.7.5	For the gods, indeed, having gone to the other world, attained the heavenly world.
4.2.5.7.6	Therefore, one should perform the praise going to the other world. One should praise going to the others.
4.2.5.8.1	The other praises are like this: "Return!"
4.2.5.8.2	One should praise going to return.
4.2.5.8.3	These praises have returned to these beings.
4.2.5.8.4	Therefore these creatures are born again and again.
4.2.5.9.1	Now, when he praises with the Bahispavamāna (hymn),
4.2.5.9.2	Here indeed was that first Aditya.
4.2.5.9.3	Having surrounded him, the seasons then went up to the heavenly world.
4.2.5.9.4	He shines established in the seasons.
4.2.5.9.5	In the same way, the priests, having taken hold of the sacrificer, ascend to the heavenly world.
4.2.5.9.6	Therefore they praise here with the Bahispavamāna.
4.2.5.10.1	For the Bahispavamaņa is indeed the boat to heaven.
4.2.5.10.2	The priests themselves are the oars and the charioteers of that boat, the means of crossing to the heavenly world.
4.2.5.10.3	He who is the only one to be blamed is the one who sinks her.
4.2.5.10.4	Just as one who has climbed onto a full boat would sink it, so does he sink her.
4.2.5.10.5	The entire sacrifice is indeed a boat to heaven.
4.2.5.10.6	Therefore, one should avoid blaming all sacrifices.
4.2.5.11.1	Then, having been praised, he speaks this speech: "O Agni, spread the fires, spread the sacrificial grass, decorate the sacrificial cakes, bring the animal."
4.2.5.11.2	Agni spreads the fires.
4.2.5.11.3	He indeed kindles them.
4.2.5.11.4	He spreads the sacrificial grass, saying, "Kindling for the gods to offer."
4.2.5.11.5	He decorates the sacrificial cakes.
4.2.5.11.6	For one who is going to perform with cakes.
4.2.5.11.7	"With the animal," he says.
4.2.5.11.8	For one who is going (to perform) with an animal.
4.2.5.12.1	Then again he takes up the Asvin cup.
4.2.5.12.2	Having taken up the Asvin graha, he goes out and encloses the sacrificial post.
4.2.5.12.3	Having enclosed the sacrificial post, he prepares the animal.
4.2.5.12.4	He places the juice in it.
4.2.5.13.1	He who has been offered at the morning pressing lies down till he is burnt at the third pressing.
4.2.5.13.2	He thus puts the essence into the whole sacrifice.
4.2.5.13.3	He thus makes the whole sacrifice flow into the essence.
4.2.5.14.1	Therefore one offers the Agniṣṭoma to Agni.
4.2.5.14.2	If one were to offer the Agniṣṭom to Agni, it would be without hair.
4.2.5.14.3	If it is a Ukthya, one should offer the second animal to Indra-Agni.
4.2.5.14.4	For the Ukthas are connected with Indra-Agni
4.2.5.14.5	If it is a Sodashi, one should offer a third animal to Indra.
4.2.5.14.6	For Indra is the Sodashi.
4.2.5.14.7	If it is an Atiratra, one should offer fourth animal to Sarasvati.
4.2.5.14.8	Sarasvati is speech.
4.2.5.14.9	Speech is a woman.
4.2.5.14.10	Night is a woman.
4.2.5.14.11	He thus turns away the sacrificial rites in the proper order.
4.2.5.15.1	Then he proceeds with the Savaniya oblations.
4.2.5.15.2	Soma is indeed a god.
4.2.5.15.3	For Soma is in heaven.
4.2.5.15.4	Soma was indeed Vritra.
4.2.5.15.5	His body is the mountains and the rocks.
4.2.5.15.6	This is the plant called Osha, says Shvetaketu Auddalaki.
4.2.5.15.7	Having brought it, they sprinkle it.
4.2.5.16.1	When he offers the animal sacrifice, he puts the sap into it.
4.2.5.16.2	When one proceeds with the Savaniya oblations, one puts the intelligence into it.
4.2.5.16.3	Thus indeed, this Soma becomes his.
4.2.5.17.1	All are dedicated to Indra.
4.2.5.17.2	Indra is the deity of the sacrifice.
4.2.5.17.3	Therefore, all are connected with Indra.
4.2.5.18.1	Now, why is there a cake, cooked rice, gruel, curds and milk-rice?
4.2.5.18.2	Because the deities of the sacrifice were well-pleased.
4.2.5.19.1	Having eaten this cake, one desires to eat cooked rice, gruels, curds and mil-k-rice.
4.2.5.19.2	All these are desires.
4.2.5.19.3	The deities of the sacrifice were well pleased.
4.2.5.19.4	And why this Payasyā is prescribed at the morning pressing only and not at the other two pressings,
4.2.5.20.1	The morning pressing is carried by the Gāyatrī, the midday pressing by the Tristubh, and the third pressing by the Jagatī.
4.2.5.21.3	There are four kinds of butter.
4.2.5.21.4	The Bahispavamāna is the fifth.
4.2.5.21.5	The Pankti has five feet.
4.2.5.21.6	With this Stotra Pankti, the single Gāyatrī carries the morning pressing.
4.2.5.22.1	Indra's cake.
4.2.5.22.2	Haryas' cooked barley.
4.2.5.22.3	Pūshans' gruel.
4.2.5.22.4	Curd for Sarasvati.
4.2.5.22.5	Milk for Mitra-Varuna.
4.2.5.22.6	The Pankhti has five feet.
4.2.5.22.7	This Gāyatrī, without a companion, carries the morning pressing with this row of oblations.
4.2.5.22.8	For the fulfilment of this very row, this Maitrāvaruṇa's Payasyā is prescribed only at the morning pressing, not at the other two pressings.
4.3.1.1.1	Having eaten, he rises, saying, "We have been invited."
4.3.1.1.2	Having taken the cake and the ladle, he places the cake and the ladles in the hand of the Upagâva when he recites the verse. He says, "O Upagâva, speak what you have to say."
4.3.1.1.3	The Upagâva was deficient.
4.3.1.2.1	Indra and Agni have followed the Upagâvas for the propagation of progeny.
4.3.1.2.2	Therefore the Upagâvâ is connected with Indra and Agni.
4.3.1.2.3	When he places this oblation in his hand, he attains it by this oblation and by the verse of Arṣeya.
4.3.1.3.1	The Acchāvāka recites the Rtugrahas on cooked (rice).
4.3.1.3.2	When the Acchāvākas recites the Rtus on cooked (rice),
4.3.1.3.3	the Acchāvāaka is a couple.
4.3.1.3.4	The Acchāvāka is indeed Indra-Agni.
4.3.1.3.5	For there are two, Indra and Agni.
4.3.1.3.6	For the pair is the begetting of offspring.
4.3.1.3.7	From this pair, the begetting of progeny, he generates the seasons and the year.
4.3.1.4.1	When the Acchāvākas chant the seasonal verses,
4.3.1.4.2	the seasons are the entire year.
4.3.1.4.3	He thus generates the entire (year).
4.3.1.4.4	Therefore, the Acchāvāka priest performs the rites of the seasons when the Soma is present.
4.3.1.5.1	One should take twelve (cups).
4.3.1.5.2	Twelve months are in a year.
4.3.1.5.3	Therefore, one should take twelve (Soma cups).
4.3.1.5.4	One should also take thirteen (cups), because there is a thirteenth month.
4.3.1.5.5	One should only take twelve (cups),
4.3.1.5.6	this is the right way.
4.3.1.7.4	Having taken it, he does not place it down.
4.3.1.7.5	Therefore this year is not fixed.
4.3.1.8.1	He does not recite the Anuvākyā.
4.3.1.8.2	One calls out with the Anuvāka.
4.3.1.8.3	The season has indeed come, whether by day or by night.
4.3.1.8.4	He does no Anuvṣṭakāra, lest he should destroy the seasons.
4.3.1.8.5	He takes the first two Grahas together, the last two together,
4.3.1.8.6	This very thing is encompassed by the year.
4.3.1.8.7	This very thing is encompassed in the year.
4.3.1.9.1	One of them goes out and the other comes in.
4.3.1.9.2	Therefore these months go on in succession.
4.3.1.9.3	Now if both of them were to go out together or both were to enter together, then indeed these months would be separate.
4.3.1.9.4	Therefore one goes out and the other enters.
4.3.1.10.1	They proceed with the seasons, six.
4.3.1.10.2	The gods created the day.
4.3.1.10.3	With the seasons, four.
4.3.1.10.4	They created the night.
4.3.1.10.5	If it had been only that much, then it would have been night.
4.3.1.10.6	It would not have been consumed.
4.3.1.11.1	They (the sun and the moon) move twice above the Rtu.
4.3.1.11.2	The gods placed the day before that.
4.3.1.11.3	Therefore, this is today's day, then night, then tomorrow will be the day.
4.3.1.12.1	The gods created men by means of the seasons, and animals by means of the months.
4.3.1.12.2	And because they created animals in the middle of them, therefore these animals are on both sides surrounded, and are subject to men.
4.3.1.13.1	The two (seasons) are called Rtunī; they should be used in the order of six. Otherwise they would be inverted in the vessel.
4.3.1.13.2	The seasons are four, and the seasons are four. If one were to turn the vessel upside down, it would be otherwise.
4.3.1.13.3	The gods created the day from one side and the night from the other side.
4.3.1.13.4	The gods have created men from one side and animals from the other side.
4.3.1.14.1	Then the Adhvaryu takes it with, "Thou art taken with a support. For Madhu thee!" and the Pratiprasthātṛ takes it with, “Thou art taken with support. For Madhava thee!”
4.3.1.14.2	These two belong to spring.
4.3.1.14.3	In spring plants grow and trees ripen. Hence these two are Madhu and Madhava.
4.3.1.15.1	The Adhvaryu takes it with the formula, "Thou art taken with a support; for Sukra thee!" The Pratiprasthātṛ takes it with the verse, "Thou art grasped with a support; thou art for Sukra."
4.3.1.15.2	These two are the summer ones.
4.3.1.15.3	He who shines more brightly of these two is Sukra and the other is Śuci.
4.3.1.16.1	The Adhvaryu takes it with the formula, "Thou art taken with a formula for the sky." The Pratiprasthātṛ takes it with the verse, "Thou art grasped with a formula for Nābhas."
4.3.1.16.2	These two are the annual ones.
4.3.1.16.3	It rains from the sky.
4.3.1.16.4	Hence these two are Nabhas and Nābhasya.
4.3.1.17.1	The Adhvaryu takes it with the formula, "Thou art taken with a support; for prosperity thee!" The Pratiprasthātṛ takes it with the verse, "Thou art grasped with a support; thou art for strength."
4.3.1.17.2	These two are indeed the autumnal ones.
4.3.1.17.3	In autumn the plants ripen with strength and juice.
4.3.1.17.4	Therefore these two are strength and juice.
4.3.1.18.1	The Adhvaryu takes it with the formula, "Thou art taken with a support; for Sahas (thou art taken). " The Pratiprasthātṛ takes it with the verse, "Thou art grasped with a support; (thou art taken) for Sahasya (thou art taken)."
4.3.1.18.2	These two are indeed the ones for the winter.
4.3.1.18.3	When in winter he brings these creatures under his own control, then these two are Sahas and Sahasya.
4.3.1.19.1	The Adhvaryu takes it with the formula, "Thou art taken with a formula for Tapas." The Pratiprasthātṛ takes it with the verse, "Thou art grasped with a formula for Tapasyā."
4.3.1.19.2	These two are the winter ones.
4.3.1.19.3	He makes one of them shine more brightly. By that they are Tapas and Tapasyā.
4.3.1.20.1	He takes up the thirteenth cup with the formula, "Thou art taken with a support; for the lord of the sacrifice thee." If he were to take up the thirteenth cup,
4.3.1.20.2	The Pratiprasthātṛ pours the remnant into the Adhvaryu's vessel; the Adhvaryus pours the remnant into Pratiprasthātr's vessel.
4.3.1.20.3	He offers the portion.
4.3.1.21.1	Then the Pratiprasthātṛ takes up the Indra-Agni cup with the food that has been eaten.
4.3.1.21.2	The reason why he takes up the Indra Agni cup with the food eaten is
4.3.1.21.3	that the Rtugrahas are not followed by the Vasat call.
4.3.1.21.4	He is going to take up the Indra- Agni cup from them.
4.3.1.21.5	They are followed by the Vas at call of Indra-Agni.
4.3.1.22.1-5	Now, when he takes the Indra-Agni cup, he generates everything. He who takes the seasonal cups, he generates this everything and establishes it in the Prāṇa and Udāna. This everything is established in the Prāņa and Udāna. For Indra and Agni are Prāṇa and Uḍāna.
4.3.1.22.6	These are the heaven and earth, the out-breath and in-breath.
4.3.1.22.7	On these all this is established.
4.3.1.23.1	In that he takes the Indra-Agni cup,
4.3.1.23.2	he who took the seasonal cups has generated all this.
4.3.1.23.3	Having generated all this, he places the out-breath, the in-breath, in this all.
4.3.1.23.4	These two, Prāṇa and Udāna, are beneficial in this entire (body).
4.3.1.24.1	Then indeed he takes up the Soma that has come, with verses, the desirable one in heaven, may it be poured down by the one who is desired by the mind. You are taken with the Upayāma-graha. This is your birthplace. You are for Indra and Agni.
4.3.1.24.2	For he takes him with Indra and Agni.
4.3.1.25.1	Then he takes the Vaiśvadeva cup.
4.3.1.25.2	He who took the seasonal cups created all this.
4.3.1.25.3	If it had been only that much, then there would have been as many creatures as were created earlier.
4.3.1.25.4	They would not have been created.
4.3.1.26.1	Now, when he takes the Vaiśvadeva cup, he thus distributes all this and these creatures in the proper manner.
4.3.1.26.2	Therefore these creatures are born again and again.
4.3.1.26.3	He takes it in the Sukra vessel.
4.3.1.26.4	This one who shines is indeed Sukra.
4.3.1.26.5	His rays are the All-gods.
4.3.1.26.6	Therefore he takes it in the Sukra vessel.
4.3.1.27.1	Now, indeed, he takes it thus: "O Soma, the lord of the people, the All-gods have come, the Dāśas, the Dāsa-wearers, for the draught of the giver. Thou art taken with a formula. This is thy birthplace. For the All-gods thee." He places it thus.
4.3.1.27.2	For indeed he takes it for the All-gods.
4.3.2.1.1	The Hotṛ indeed sings when he recites.
4.3.2.1.2	Therefore the Adhvaryu recites in reply to him.
4.3.2.1.3	Therefore it is called Prati-gara.
4.3.2.2.1	He calls him while he is seated facing east.
4.3.2.2.2	All the others perform their priestly duties facing east of the Udgātṛ.
4.3.2.2.3	Thus his priestly duty is performed facing east.
4.3.2.3.1	Prajapati is the Udgata.
4.3.2.3.2	The female is the Hotar.
4.3.2.3.3	Prajapati, the Udgata, pours semen into the female, the Richi, the Hotar, when he praises.
4.3.2.3.4	The Hotar generates it with the Sastra, and it becomes sharp, like this man is sharp.
4.3.2.3.5	And because he makes it sharp, therefore it is called Sastra.
4.3.2.4.1	And having understood it, he responds.
4.3.2.4.2	This very semen is deposited and is made to flow.
4.3.2.4.3	If one were to receive it while standing away, then the semen deposited would be lost away.
4.3.2.4.4	It would not be born.
4.3.2.4.5	Having become in the same direction, they generate this semen deposited.
4.3.2.5.1	The metres are exhausted by the gods.
4.3.2.5.2	For the gods attained heaven by means of the metres.
4.3.2.5.3	Madhu is the counter-verse.
4.3.2.5.4	That which is Madhu in the verse, and Rasa in the Sama,
4.3.2.5.5	he places that Rasa in the metres.
4.3.2.5.6	He makes them not deficient.
4.3.2.5.7	With those not deficient they perform the sacrifice.
4.3.2.6.1	Therefore, if one recites half a verse at a time, one should respond half a verse at half a verse.
4.3.2.6.2	If one recites in sequence, one should respond in each step.
4.3.2.6.3	Where the reciter falters, the Asura demons follow the sacrifice.
4.3.2.6.4	One binds it with the response, to prevent the demons from following.
4.3.2.7.7	Those syllables came to Soma.
4.3.2.7.8	Then the Gāyatrī became eight syllables.
4.3.2.7.9	Therefore they say, "The Gāyatrī is eight syllables."
4.3.2.8.1	With that they performed the morning pressing.
4.3.2.8.2	Therefore the morning pressing is Gāyatrī.
4.3.2.8.3	With that very one they performed the midday pressing.
4.3.2.8.4	She said to the Tristubh, "I will come to you with three syllables. Call me, lest I be absent from the sacrifice."
4.3.2.8.5	"So be it," she called her.
4.3.2.8.6	Then the Tristubh became eleven syllables.
4.3.2.8.7	Therefore they say, "The midday pressing is Tristubh."
4.3.2.9.1	With that very one they performed the third pressing.
4.3.2.9.2	She said to him, "I will come to you with one syllable. Call me, lest I disappear from the sacrifice."
4.3.2.9.3	He said, "So be it." He called her.
4.3.2.9.4	Then the Jagati became twelve syllables.
4.3.2.9.5	Therefore they say, "The third pressing is Jagat."
4.3.2.10.1	They say, "All the pressings are Gāyatrī.
4.3.2.10.2	For this is the Gayatri, coming with the Upasargas.
4.3.2.10.3	Therefore one should recite it at the morning pressing when it is accomplished.
4.3.2.10.4	For the Gayatri comes when it is accomplished
4.3.2.10.5	Once at the midday pressing.
4.3.2.10.6	For it comes leaving one syllable.
4.3.2.10.7	By that he makes it complete, makes it whole.
4.3.2.12.3	He thus places the essence of these two, heaven and earth.
4.3.2.12.4	These creatures live on them, which are full of essence and nourishing.
4.3.2.12.5	He should indeed respond with 'Om'.
4.3.2.12.6	For that is the truth.
4.3.2.12.7	The gods know that.
4.3.2.13.1	They respond with 'Om' or 'Ha', saying, 'Speech is the response', saying, 'We have attained speech.'
4.3.2.13.2	He should not do it like that.
4.3.2.13.3	As one who recites a story, his speech becomes obtained.
4.3.2.13.4	For one recites with speech.
4.3.2.13.5	Therefore one should recite with 'Om'.
4.3.2.13.6	That is the truth.
4.3.2.13.7	The gods know that.
4.3.3.1.1	He recites 'Here, here'
4.3.3.1.2	He thus unites with Indra.
4.3.3.1.3	He thus makes Indra great by saying, "Great, great."
4.3.3.2.1	He takes the first two Soma-cups, namely, the Sukra and the Manthin.
4.3.3.2.2	For this pressing is like the Sukra.
4.3.3.2.3	Then the Aggrayan.
4.3.3.2.4	For it is taken at all pressings.
4.3.3.2.5	Then the Marutvatīya, then the Ukthya.
4.3.3.2.6	For praises are also performed here.
4.3.3.3.1	Having taken the Ukthya cup, they take the Marutvatīya cup.
4.3.3.3.2	One should not do it like that.
4.3.3.3.3	Having taken the Marutvatlya cup, one should take the Ukthya.
4.3.3.4.1	He takes these five cups.
4.3.3.4.2	The Madhyamdina Pavamana is indeed the thunderbolt.
4.3.3.4.3	Therefore it is fifteenfold and has five Sama-s.
4.3.3.4.4	For the thunderbolt is fifteenfold.
4.3.3.4.5	He strikes with these five planets.
4.3.3.4.6	There are five fingers here.
4.3.3.4.7	One strikes with fingers.
4.3.3.5.1	Indra struck Vritra with the thunderbolt.
4.3.3.5.2	Having slain Vritra, the evil one, he led the Dakshina to the conquered, the fearless, the undying.
4.3.3.5.3	Therefore, even now, when they praise with this midday Pavamāna, then the sacrificial gifts are taken to the conquered, fearless, and uninjured (place).
4.3.3.5.4	Thus indeed, with these five Grahas, he strikes the thunderbolt at the sinful, hostile, and inimical foe.
4.3.3.5.5	Having slain Vritra, the evil one, he leads the Dakshina to the conquered, the unconquered, the unvanquished.
4.3.3.5.6	From that he takes these five Grahas.
4.3.3.6.1	That he takes the Marutvatlya Grahas,
4.3.3.6.2	This is Indra's exclusive Soma-pressing, namely the midday pressing.
4.3.3.6.3	With that he attacked Vritra.
4.3.3.6.4	With that, he conquered.
4.3.3.7.2	"You will slay Vṛtra with your strength."
4.3.3.7.3	They said, "What will be ours from that?"
4.3.3.7.4	He took up these two Marutvatiya cups for them.
4.3.3.8.1	They said, “Having put it down, we will return with strength.”
4.3.3.8.2	Having put it down they returned with strength.
4.3.3.8.3	Then Indra took it, having placed it in the fire, and they came back together with the strength.
4.3.3.9.1	He said, "Come back together with the power."
4.3.3.9.2	"They said, "You take the third cup for us."
4.3.3.9.3	He took this third cup for them, saying, "You are taken with a support, for the strength of the Maruts."
4.3.3.9.4	They came back together with him.
4.3.3.9.5	They conquered.
4.3.3.9.6	They slew Vritra.
4.3.3.9.7	Indra is the nobility,
4.3.3.9.8	the Maruts are the people.
4.3.3.9.9	The noble becomes strong through the people.
4.3.3.9.10	He thus places strength in the nobility itself.
4.3.3.9.11	Therefore he takes the Marutvatīya.
4.3.3.10.1	He should take it for Indra alone, not for the Maruts.
4.3.3.10.2	If he were to take it from the Maruts, he would make the people turn against the nobility.
4.3.3.10.3	Now this (graha) is taken by the Maruts in accordance with Indra.
4.3.3.10.4	He thus makes the people turn towards the nobility, and follow it.
4.3.3.10.5	Therefore one should take it for Indra alone, and not for the Maruts.
4.3.3.11.1	He feared that they would not go away from him, that they would not be different from him.
4.3.3.11.2	He made them not to go away.
4.3.3.11.3	Therefore one should take for Indra alone with the Maruts, and not for the Maruts.
4.3.3.12.1	He takes (the Soma) in the vessels of the seasons.
4.3.3.12.2	The seasons are the year, the sacrifice.
4.3.3.12.3	They are directly determined at the morning pressing when he takes up the Rtugrahas.
4.3.3.12.4	Then they are indirectly determined at the midday pressing when he takes the Marutvatiya cups in the Rtu vessels.
4.3.3.12.5	The Maruts are the classes.
4.3.3.12.6	The classes are food.
4.3.3.12.7	The seasons cook all this food.
4.3.3.12.8	Therefore, one takes the Marutvatiya cups from the Rtupaatra cups.
4.3.3.13.1	Then indeed he takes it, saying, "O Indra, do thou protect here the Soma as thou didst drink it at Sarayati. O Indra, the wise ones, the well-sacrificers, have entered thy protection, thy favour, O hero. Thou art taken with a formula. For Indra thee, for Indra, the lord of the Maruts. This is thy birthplace. For Indra thee for Indra, the Lord of the Maruts.
4.3.3.14.1	Taken with a support, thee to Indra, the Marut-worshipper. This is thy place, thee to Indra the Marut- worshipper. Taken with a support thee to the strength of the Maruts.
4.3.3.15.1	Then he takes up the cup for Indra.
4.3.3.15.2	Indra was united with sin when he ate with the Maruts.
4.3.3.15.3	Just as one would eat in the same vessel for the sake of victory, so it was when they took this cup for him in common with the Maruts.
4.3.3.16.1	The gods, having conquered all, having attained safety, having attained the absence of fear, removed all sin, just as one removes a straw from a reed, when they took the Maheśvara cup.
4.3.3.16.2	In the same way, he is freed from all sin when he takes the Maheśvaragraha.
4.3.3.17.1	When he takes the Maheendra cup,
4.3.3.17.2	Indra was this (cup) before the slaying of Vritra.
4.3.3.17.3	Then having slain Vritra, he became like a great king who has won a battle.
4.3.3.17.4	Therefore he takes the Mahendra cup.
4.3.3.17.5	He makes him great for the slaying of Vrita.
4.3.3.17.6	Therefore he takes the cup of Indra.
4.3.3.17.7	He takes it with the cup of Shukra.
4.3.3.17.8	This one shines, he who shines here.
4.3.3.17.9	He is indeed great.
4.3.3.17.10	Therefore he takes it with the Shukra cup.
4.3.3.18.1	Then he takes it up, indeed, Indra, the great, like a man, with the help of the two-storied ones, with his irresistible strength, has grown in his own place for the sake of valour. The mighty, the wide, the well-done, has grown for the doers. Thou art taken with a formula. This is thy birthplace. For thee to Mahendra.
4.3.3.18.2	He takes it for the great Indra.
4.3.3.19.1	Then, having taken up the speech, he says: "The sprinklers sprinkle, the sprinklers sprinkle, let the mortar-beaters beat the mortars, let the Agnidh (priest) arrange the grass, let the Soma-presser press the Soma."
4.3.3.19.2	The sprinklers sprinkle for the third pressing.
4.3.3.19.3	They (the priests) begin to grind the pestles for the third pressing.
4.3.3.19.4	The Agnid (priest) places the wooden sword for the third pressing (in the fire).
4.3.3.19.5	He cooks the Soma-cake for the third pressing,
4.3.3.19.6	These two pressings, the morning and the midday, are indeed the bright and the tasty pressings.
4.3.3.19.7	But this pressing, the third, is the bright and tasty one.
4.3.3.19.8	He makes it from the midday pressing.
4.3.3.19.9	So indeed his third pressing becomes bright and full of juice.
4.3.3.19.10	Therefore he speaks this speech here.
4.3.4.1.1	They indeed kill the sacrifice when they build it up.
4.3.4.1.2	When they anoint the king, they kill him.
4.3.4.1.3	When they kill the animal, they kill it.
4.3.4.1.4	With pestle and mortar, with the stone and the pestle, they kill the sacrificial offering.
4.3.4.2.1	This sacrifice, killed, did not give.
4.3.4.2.2	The gods made it give by means of the Dakṣiṇās.
4.3.4.2.3	And because they made it give by the Dakṣiṇa, therefore it is called Dakṣiṇā.
4.3.4.2.4	Whatever of the sacrifice is injured or distressed, that he makes whole again by means of the Dakṣiṇās.
4.3.4.2.5	And the sacrifice becomes complete.
4.3.4.2.6	Therefore one gives Dakṣiṇā.
4.3.4.3.1	At the Haviṣyajna they give six or twelve.
4.3.4.3.2	But the Soma sacrifice should not be without Dakṣiṇas.
4.3.4.3.3-7	This indeed is the direct sacrifice, namely Prajapati. Purusha is the nearest to Prajapati. He is a hundred years old, a hundredfold in lustre and a hundredfold in energy. He is honoured with a hundred (gifts), not with less than a hundred. Therefore, the Soma sacrifice should be with a hundred gifts.
4.3.4.3.8	The officiating priests of the sacrificer should not be paid in cattle. They should not be the eyes of the sacrificer, lest they should be killed by those who will not do good to him.
4.3.4.4.1	The gods are of two kinds.
4.3.4.4.2	The gods who are gods.
4.3.4.4.3	And those Brahmanas who are learned and knowers of the Veda, they are the human gods.
4.3.4.4.4-5	Of these, the sacrifice is divided into two kinds: oblations alone are for the gods, and gifts for the human gods, for the Brahmanas who listen and for the students.
4.3.4.4.6	The gods, being pleased, carry him to the world of heaven.
4.3.4.5.1	These are indeed the fees for the priests.
4.3.4.5.2	They make this sacrifice consisting of the Rg, Yajus, and Sama, consisting of oblations.
4.3.4.5.3	This becomes his self in the other world.
4.3.4.5.4	Therefore one should give the Dakṣiṇā to the priests and not to non-priests.
4.3.4.6.1	Then having returned, one offers the Dakṣiṇa to the Garhapatya.
4.3.4.6.2	Having bound a piece of gold in a garment worn for ten days, one offers.
4.3.4.6.3	"One performs sacrifice, saying, "May I have a share in the world of gods." He who performs sacrifice,
4.3.4.6.4	This sacrifice of his goes to the world of the gods.
4.3.4.6.5	The Dakṣiṇā that he gives in accordance with this (sacrifice) follows the Dakṣiṇās. The sacrificer follows the Dakṣinās.
4.3.4.7.1	There are four Dakṣiṇas: gold, cow, garment, and horse.
4.3.4.7.2	It is not proper to place the foot of a horse or the foot of a cow.
4.3.4.7.3	Therefore, one offers on the garment worn for ten days, having tied a golden thread.
4.3.4.8.1	One offers with two verses addressed to Surya.
4.3.4.8.2	This world is hidden by darkness.
4.3.4.8.3	He removes that darkness with this light and goes to the heavenly world.
4.3.4.8.4	Therefore, one offers with two verses to Surya.
4.3.4.9.1	He offers with the verse, "The bards carry the god Jātavedas, the Sun, for all to see. Svāhā!" This is the Gāyatrī metre.
4.3.4.9.2	This earth is Gāyatrī.
4.3.4.9.3	This is the foundation.
4.3.4.9.4	He thus establishes himself on this foundation.
4.3.4.10.1	Then he offers the second (oblation) with the verse, "The variegated army of the gods has risen, the eye of Mitra, Varuna and Agni. He has brought the heaven, earth and the atmosphere, the sun, the self of the moving and standing world. Svāhā!" with this Tristubh verse.
4.3.4.10.2	He indeed approaches the world with this.
4.3.4.11.1	Then at the Agnidhra (fire-chamber) he offers two or one oblation.
4.3.4.11.2	If one offers two oblations in the Agni and Āgnīdhra fires,
4.3.4.11.3	Agni is the bestower of cattle.
4.3.4.11.4	They sit around him.
4.3.4.11.5	He pleases him with this oblation.
4.3.4.11.6	He, being pleased, gives his consent.
4.3.4.11.7	He gives what is consented to.
4.3.4.12.1	He offers (with the verse), "O Agni, do thou lead us on the path of wealth, O god, knowing all the ways, do thou unite us with great gain. Do thou remove our sin, and may we offer unto thee. We offer thee the most abundant praise, svāhā."
4.3.4.12.2	If one is going to give a horse or a mule, then he should offer the second oblation.
4.3.4.12.3	If one does not heed it,
4.3.4.13.1	He offers with the verse, "May this Agni be our protector, may he go forth breaking the foes, may he conquer the prizes, may he conquer his enemies, may he conquer, svāhā."
4.3.4.13.2	For the horse is indeed a prize-winner.
4.3.4.14.1	Then taking gold, he approaches the hall.
4.3.4.14.2	The Dakṣiṇās stand to the south of the altar.
4.3.4.14.3	He, standing in front of the hall, recites, "With form I have approached your form."
4.3.4.14.4	For the animals did not at first consent to be given away.
4.3.4.14.5	Having put aside their own forms, they stood up with their bodies.
4.3.4.14.6	The gods then approached them with their own forms from half of the sacrifice.
4.3.4.14.7	They approached, knowing their own forms.
4.3.4.14.8	They become satisfied and are ready to give.
4.3.4.14.9	In the same way, this (fire) approaches half of the sacrifice with its own forms.
4.3.4.14.10	They know their own forms and come back.
4.3.4.14.11	They become satisfied and are willing to give.
4.3.4.15.1	May Tutha, the knower of all, divide you.
4.3.4.15.2	Tutha is indeed Brahman.
4.3.4.15.3	He divides them with Brahman.
4.3.4.15.4	Brahma knows what is to be given and what is not to be given.
4.3.4.15.5	Thus they are given to one who is to be given to, not to one who is not to be.
4.3.4.16.1	"Having gone by the path of truth."
4.3.4.16.2	He who goes by the path of the gods goes by the path.
4.3.4.16.3	"The gift is the moon."
4.3.4.16.4	They go by this light.
4.3.4.17.1	Then he approaches the assembly, reciting, "May I see the sky."
4.3.4.17.2	He means, "May I be seen by you, O Dakṣiṇā, in the world."
4.3.4.18.1	Then he looks at the assembly, reciting "Strive with the members of the assembly."
4.3.4.18.2	He means "May the members of the Assembly not injure you."
4.3.4.19.1	Then taking gold, he approaches the Agnidhra with the verse, "Today I shall know the Brahman, the one who is endowed with the fathers and the fatherly."
4.3.4.19.2	He who is known and of a known family is endowed with the father and the fatherly.
4.3.4.19.3	Even if one gives a few gifts to a known woman, one wins a great deal by them.
4.3.4.19.4	"The sage and the one born in the sage's family."
4.3.4.19.5	The one who is known as Anūcānas is the Rishi, the son of a Rishi.
4.3.4.19.6	The Dakshina is in the form of gold.
4.3.4.19.7	He is indeed the one who gives the Dakshina in the form of golden.
4.3.4.20.1	Then, while performing the Upasads, he gives gold to the Agnidhra, saying, "May it go to the gods as given by us."
4.3.4.20.2	One who gives Dakshina with a determined mind and without hesitation, conquers greatness with that.
4.3.4.20.3	"He goes to the world of the gods." "He who sacrifices, he sacrifices for me."
4.3.4.20.4	He thus makes him a sharer in the world of the Gods.
4.3.4.20.5	"He enters the giver." He means to say, "He enters me."
4.3.4.20.6	Thus these do not perish from here.
4.3.4.20.7	When he gives the first gift to the Agnidhra,
4.3.4.20.8	For the All-gods won immortality from it.
4.3.4.20.9	Therefore he gives the first Dakṣiṇā to the Agnidh.
4.3.4.21.1	And thus he gives gold to the Upa-sadyā-treya.
4.3.4.21.2	Where they recite the morning Prastara, there they used to recite this before:
4.3.4.21.3	"Atri was the Hotṛ of the Rṣis.
4.3.4.21.4	Then this assembly-hall of the gods dispelled the darkness of the Asuras.
4.3.4.21.5	The sages said to Atri, "Come, dispel this darkness from the west."
4.3.4.21.6	He dispelled that darkness.
4.3.4.21.7	"He who dispelled this darkness is indeed the light," and therefore they gave him gold as a fee.
4.3.4.21.8	For gold is light.
4.3.4.21.9	That sage, indeed, by his brilliance and energy, removed the darkness.
4.3.4.21.10	Now he removes the darkness by means of this very light.
4.3.4.21.11	Therefore he places gold for Atri.
4.3.4.22.1	Then for Brahman.
4.3.4.22.2	For Brahman protects the sacrifice from the south.
4.3.4.22.3	Then to the Udgâtri, then to the Hotri, then to the Adhvaryus seated in the Havirdhâna.
4.3.4.22.4	Then returning again, to the Prastôtṛ, then to the Maitrâvaruna, then to the Brâhmanâcchaṁsin, then to the Potr, then to the Neṣṭr, then to the Âcchâvâka, then to the Unnetr, then to Gravastut, then to Subrahmaṇyā.
4.3.4.22.5	He gives to the Pratihartṛ, the last.
4.3.4.22.6	Or he is the one who repels.
4.3.4.22.7	He repels this from us at the very end.
4.3.4.22.8	Thus these do not perish from us.
4.3.4.23.1	Then he says, "Recite to Indra associated with Maruts."
4.3.4.23.2	Where indeed Prajapati first gave, there Indra looked. "This one will give everything to us.
4.3.4.23.3	He will not leave anything for us."
4.3.4.23.4	He took up this thunderbolt for Indra, the lord of Maruts, saying, "Recite after me, do not give."
4.3.4.23.5	He did not give.
4.3.4.23.6	Even now this thunderbolt is taken up in the same way for Indra, the Lord of Maruts, reciting after me, do no give.
4.3.4.23.7	He does not give.
4.3.4.24.1	There are four kinds of gifts: gold,
4.3.4.24.2	By this he protects his own life.
4.3.4.24.3	For life is gold.
4.3.4.24.4	They make the Agni-dhra (priest) of Agni. He gave (the gold).
4.3.4.24.5	Therefore even now gold is given to the Agni-dhara.
4.3.4.25.1	Then the cow.
4.3.4.25.2	By this he protects his life.
4.3.4.25.3	For breath is a cow.
4.3.4.25.4	For food is a cow.
4.3.4.25.5	Food is indeed the breath.
4.3.4.25.6	He gave it to Rudra as the Hotri.
4.3.4.26.1	Then the garment.
4.3.4.26.2	One indeed protects oneself with this from the skin.
4.3.4.26.3	The skin is indeed the garment.
4.3.4.26.4	He gave that to Brihaspati as the Udgata.
4.3.4.27.1	Then the horse.
4.3.4.27.2	The horse is indeed the thunderbolt.
4.3.4.27.3	One indeed makes the thunderbolt go in front.
4.3.4.27.4	He who sacrifices to Yama in the world of Yama, saying, "This is not mine in the world of the dead," he sacrifices.
4.3.4.27.5	He thus makes him who has been sacrificed to Yama in the other world.
4.3.4.27.6	He gave him to Yama, the Brahman.
4.3.4.28.1	He returned the gold, saying, "May Agni give it to you for me."
4.3.4.28.2	For Agni gave it to him.
4.3.4.28.3	"May he live immortal, may he give to me, may he take from me."
4.3.4.29.1	Then he says to the cow, "May Varuna give you to me for Rudra."
4.3.4.29.2	For Varuna gave her to Rudra.
4.3.4.29.3	"May he live immortal. May he give to me the life-force, may he take the body from me."
4.3.4.30.1	Then he takes possession of the garment, saying, "For Brihaspati thee, Varuna has given to me."
4.3.4.30.2	For Varuna indeed gave this to Brihaspati.
4.3.4.30.3	"May he attain immortality, may the skin be thine, may the gift be mine, may the recipient be mine."
4.3.4.31.1	Then he takes possession of a horse, saying, "To Yama thee, Varuna gave to me."
4.3.4.31.2	For Yama gave this to Varuna.
4.3.4.31.3	"May he attain immortality, and may the giver attain long life."
4.3.4.32.1	And when he gives something else, he gives it out of desire, thinking, "May this be mine in the hereafter."
4.3.4.32.2	Who gave it? For what purpose did he give it? Desire gave it, for the sake of desire he gave it, desire is the giver, desire is the receiver, this is his.
4.3.4.32.3	He directs it to the deity.
4.3.4.33.1	They say, one should not direct it to the deity,
4.3.4.33.2	For this is said, "The deity that one kindles, she shines forth, and becomes more and more excellent day by day."
4.3.4.33.3	This is the fire in which they offer it. He who offers it becomes better and better every day.
4.3.4.33.4	He who knows this and accepts it becomes better and bettter every day.
4.3.4.33.5	Just as one would offer to a kindled fire, so one offers this when one studies and gives.
4.3.4.33.6	Therefore, one who is studying should not point out.
4.3.5.1.1	The three gods are the Vasus, Rudras and Adityas.
4.3.5.1.2	Their Savanas are divided.
4.3.5.1.3	The morning Savana is of the Vasus alone.
4.3.5.1.4	The midday Savana is of Rudras.
4.3.5.1.5	The third Savana is of Adityas. 
4.3.5.1.6	The morning Savan of the Vasus is indeed unmixed.
4.3.5.1.7	The midday savana of the Rudras is unmixed.
4.3.5.1.8	The third pressing of the Adityas is mixed.
4.3.5.2.1	The Adityas said, "Just as this is the mixed morning pressing of the Vasus, the mixed midday pressing of the Rudras, so do not offer this Soma-graha before the mixed one."
4.3.5.2.2	The gods said, "So be it."
4.3.5.3.2	"May the Rakshas not harm us."
4.3.5.4.1	They said to the gods of two deities, "We are afraid of the Rakshas."
4.3.5.4.2	"We wish to enter you."
4.3.5.5.1	The gods of two deities said, "What will be ours from that?"
4.3.5.5.2	The Adityas said, "You will be blessed by us."
4.3.5.5.3	"So be it."
4.3.5.5.4	They enter the two-deity (sheds).
4.3.5.6.1	Where the morning pressing is performed with the two-deities, the Pratiprasthātṛ takes from the Dronakalaśa with the Aditya-vessel with the formula, "Thou art taken with a support."
4.3.5.6.2	Only the Adhvaryu invites.
4.3.5.6.3	The Homa is offered by the Pratiprasthatṛ after the Adhvaryus.
4.3.5.6.4	He pours down the remnants of the oblations with the formula, "For the Adityas thee."
4.3.5.6.5	In the same way in all (oblations).
4.3.5.7.1	When the Pratiprasthātṛ takes it back,
4.3.5.7.2	they entered the two-deity (sacrifices).
4.3.5.7.3	The Adityas said, "You will be invoked with the Vasat-utterance by us.
4.3.5.7.4-9	Or, when he offers that second oblation, he offers it to Sviṣṭakṛt. These are offered to Sviṣțakṛt. Thus they are offered to Svistakṛt. They become the Iṣṭa and Sviṣṭa. He offers in the northern half. This is the direction of this deity. Therefore he offers in the northern part.
4.3.5.8.1	The Pratiprasthātṛ takes it.
4.3.5.8.2	They entered the two-deity (sacrifices).
4.3.5.8.3	He thus makes them out of those (sacrifices) which he entered.
4.3.5.8.4	Then he puts it down,
4.3.5.8.5	for they were afraid of the Rakṣas.
4.3.5.8.6	"This Soma is for thee, O Viṣṇu, the all-pervading; protect it, may it not injure thee."
4.3.5.8.7	Viṣṇu is the sacrifice.
4.3.5.8.8	He thus gives it to the sacrifice for protection.
4.3.5.8.9	Then he says, "The midday pressing has been completed. Come, O sacrificer, before the third pressing."
4.3.5.9.1	The Adhvaryu, the sacrificer, the Agnidhra, the Pratiprasthâtri, the Unnetr and whoever else may be the attendant approach.
4.3.5.9.2	They close both the doors.
4.3.5.9.3	They were afraid of the Rakshas.
4.3.5.9.4	Then the Adhvaryu takes the Aditya-vessel and the Aditya-cup.
4.3.5.9.5	He takes it above the Puta-vessel, lest it should flow away.
4.3.5.10.1	Then he takes it up with the verse, "O Indra, thou art never stingy; thou bestowest on the worshipper. O bountiful one, do thou come again and again. Thy gift is sought by the gods. For the Adityas thee."
4.3.5.11.1	One should take it up with the Upayāma-formula.
4.3.5.11.2	For this is taken up with the Upayama-formula at the very outset.
4.3.5.11.3	For immortality.
4.3.5.11.4	If he were to take it here with the Upayāma-formula, he would do something wrong.
4.3.5.12.1	Then, having taken it away, he brings it back, saying, "I have taken away both the births of the one who is not to be taken away. The fourth is the Savana of the Sun. It is the strength of Indra. It stands in the immortal, divine Sun. To you, O Sun, I offer."
4.3.5.13.1	Then he takes curd.
4.3.5.13.2	The third pressing is of the Adityas.
4.3.5.13.3	The cattle follow the Adityas;
4.3.5.13.4	he thus places the milk in the cattle.
4.3.5.13.5	They say, "One should take it as if in the middle of the cattle."
4.3.5.13.6	For the milk is as if in the midst of the cattle.
4.3.5.13.7	One should take it at the rear.
4.3.5.13.8	The milk of the animals is indeed like this.
4.3.5.14.1	He takes curd,
4.3.5.14.2	because these are the remnants of the oblation, not enough for the oblation.
4.3.5.14.3	He thus again nourishes them.
4.3.5.14.4	They then become enough for the oblations.
4.3.5.14.5	Therefore he takes curd.
4.3.5.15.1	He takes it with the formula, "The sacrifice of the gods is the agreeable. The Adityas are pleased with you. May your good intention come to us. May we be the most generous among those who are generous. To the Adityas belongs thee."
4.3.5.16.1	He consecrates him with the Upāṁshusavana rite.
4.3.5.16.2	This Adityas is indeed Vivasvan. The Upāṁshusaavana rite is the origin.
4.3.5.16.3	This is indeed a solar eclipse.
4.3.5.16.4	He thus pleases him in his own share.
4.3.5.17.1	He does not touch it with the ten fingers or with the strainer.
4.3.5.17.2	These two, the morning and midday pressing, are indeed rich in lustre and juice.
4.3.5.17.3	And this third pressing is indeed the lustre that has been shed.
4.3.5.17.4	When he does not touch it with the ten fingers and the strainer, then this Soma-drink of his becomes bright and tasty, like the third pressing.
4.3.5.17.5	Therefore he does not touch with the ten fingers or the strainer.
4.3.5.18.1	He says, "O Vivasvan, this is your Soma-drink. Enjoy it."
4.3.5.18.2	Then the Unnetr gives the Upamshu-savan.
4.3.5.18.3	Then he places the Hotr-priest in the Gravaṇīya-vessel.
4.3.5.18.4	He places them in the Adhavanīya vessel or in a cup.
4.3.5.19.1	Having carried the king,
4.3.5.19.2	the third pressing belongs to the Ādityas.
4.3.5.19.3	The Gravaṇīyas follow the Ādityās.
4.3.5.19.4	He thus pleases them in their own share.
4.3.5.19.5	They fill up the door.
4.3.5.20.1	Then having closed (the door) he goes out.
4.3.5.20.2	They were afraid of the Rakshas.
4.3.5.20.3	Then he says, "Recite for the Adityas."
4.3.5.20.4	Here one should look if one desires:
4.3.5.20.5	Having called out, one should look for the Adityyas, the beloved, the ones with a beloved abode, the ones with beloved vows, the lords of the great ocean, the rulers of the sky, the overseers.
4.3.5.20.6	One offers at the Vasat call.
4.3.5.20.7	He does not recite the Vasat call, lest he should offer the animals into the fire.
4.3.5.20.8	He gives the two remnants to the Pratiprasthātṛ.
4.3.5.21.1	Then again he takes up the Āgrayana.
4.3.5.21.2	They spread the strainer with the opening towards the north.
4.3.5.21.3	The Adhvaryu causes the Āgrayana to flow.
4.3.5.21.4	The Pratiprasthātr receives the two remnants.
4.3.5.21.5	The Unnetr brings it with a cup or a vessel.
4.3.5.22.1	He takes the Aggrayan from four streams.
4.3.5.22.2	The third pressing belongs to the Adityas.
4.3.5.22.3	The cows follow the Adityas;
4.3.5.22.4	Therefore, the milk of cows is divided into four parts.
4.3.5.22.5	Therefore, he takes the Aggrayaṇ from four streams.
4.3.5.23.1	Now, when the Pratiprasthātṛ takes the two drops of Soma,
4.3.5.23.2	it is indeed a solar rite.
4.3.5.23.3	One does not recite the Anuvṣṭakāra for a solar rite. But one recites it for this rite.
4.3.5.23.4	One performs this rite after having taken the Savitr graha.
4.3.5.23.5	Thus he has the Anuvṣṣṭakāra recited by Savitr.
4.3.5.24.1	When the Pratiprasthatṛ takes the two Soma drops,
4.4.1.1.2	Therefore he takes the Savitr.
4.4.1.1.3	For Savitr is his breath.
4.4.1.1.4	When he takes the Upāṁshu, he places that breath in front of him.
4.4.1.1.5	When he grasps the Savitr, he places that same breath behind him.
4.4.1.1.6	These two are the vital breaths on both sides, the one above and the one below.
4.4.1.2.1	The seasons are indeed the year, the sacrifice.
4.4.1.2.2	They are directly determined at the morning pressing, when he takes up the seasonal cups.
4.4.1.2.3	Now, at the midday pressing, the Parosakhas are assigned. When he takes the Marutvatīya cups with the Rtupa (cups),
4.4.1.2.4	they do not take any cup for the Rtus.
4.4.1.2.5	No cup is taken with the Rtu cups.
4.4.1.3.1	This indeed is Savitr, who shines yonder.
4.4.1.3.2	He alone is all the seasons.
4.4.1.3.3	The seasons are directly perceived in the third pressing of the Soma.
4.4.1.3.4	Therefore he takes up the Savitr cup.
4.4.1.4.1	He takes it up in the Upāṁshu cup.
4.4.1.4.2	The mind indeed is his Savitr.
4.4.1.4.3	The breath is Upāṁshu.
4.4.1.4.4	Therefore he should take it up in the Upaṁshu cup or in the Antaryāma cup.
4.4.1.6.1	Then he takes the left hand, saying, "Today, O Savitar, give me the left, and tomorrow, and on every day, give me the right. For thou art the giver of the right, O god, by the right knowledge. May we be partakers of the right. Thou art taken with a support. Thou art Savitar. Thou art the protector of the right. Protect the right in me. Animate the sacrifice, animate the lord of sacrifice for prosperity."
4.4.1.7.1	Having taken it, he does not place it down.
4.4.1.7.2	The mind indeed is his Savitr.
4.4.1.7.3	Therefore this mind is not firm.
4.4.1.7.4	The breath indeed is his Savitri.
4.4.1.7.5	Therefore this breath moves not firmly.
4.4.1.7.6	Then he says, "Recite to the god Savitr."
4.4.1.7.7	Having announced, he says, "Send to the god Savitri."
4.4.1.7.8	He offers at the Vasat-utterance.
4.4.1.7.9	He does not offer the Anuvṣat-oblation.
4.4.1.7.10	Mind indeed is his Savitr.
4.4.1.7.11	"He thinks, "I shall not let my mind go into the fire."
4.4.1.7.12	Breath indeed is his Savitṛ.
4.4.1.7.13	"He (thinks), "I shall not allow my breath to go into the fire."
4.4.1.8.1	Then with a vessel containing food he takes the Vaiśvadevī Graha.
4.4.1.8.2	When he takes the Vaišvadevī Grahas with a vessel containing cooked food,
4.4.1.8.3	He does not offer the Savitrī-anuvṣat.
4.4.1.8.4	One takes up the Vaiśvadevam Graha for this reason.
4.4.1.8.5	This is offered to him by the Vaiśvadeva.
4.4.1.9.1	When one takes up the Vaišvadevam Graba,
4.4.1.9.2	Savitr is his mind.
4.4.1.9.3	All this is the Viśve Devas.
4.4.1.9.4	This is the only thing that is done by the mind, the only path to be followed.
4.4.1.9.5	This is the only thing done by the mind and the only path to follow.
4.4.1.10.1	When he takes the Vaiśvadeva cup,
4.4.1.10.2	it is indeed his life-force that is Savitr.
4.4.1.10.3	All this is the Viśve Devas.
4.4.1.10.4	He thus places the life-force and out-breath in all this.
4.4.1.10.5	These two are beneficial in all this, the Prāṇa and Udāna.
4.4.1.11.1	He indeed takes the Vaiśvadeva cup.
4.4.1.11.2	The third pressing is indeed Vaiśvadeva.
4.4.1.11.3	It is said that the third pressing is called Vaishvadeva because it is said to be Rk-based. This is the Yajus-based. When one takes this Mahavaishvadeva, it is the Purascharaṇa-based.
4.4.1.12.1	It is taken by the Pūtabhṛt.
4.4.1.12.2	Pūtabhṛta is Vaishvadeva.
4.4.1.12.3	Therefore they take it from the gods, from men, from the fathers.
4.4.1.12.4	Therefore the Vaiśvadeva is the Pūtabhṛt.
4.4.1.13.1	He takes it without a front-piece.
4.4.1.13.2	For he takes it for all the gods.
4.4.1.13.3	All are the All-gods, namely the Ṛks, the Yajuses, the Sāmans,
4.4.1.13.4	When he takes it for the All-gods, then indeed, it becomes a leader for him.
4.4.1.13.5	Therefore one takes it for the Puroruk (hymn).
4.4.1.14.1	Then he takes it with the formula, "Thou art taken with the Upāṁsu-graha; thou art Suśarman, thou art Supratiṣṭhāna."
4.4.1.14.2	Suśarman, Supratiṣṭhānam is indeed the Prāṇa.
4.4.1.14.3	"Salutations to the great-uddered one."
4.4.1.14.4	Prajapati is the great milker.
4.4.1.14.5	He says this indeed, "Salutations to Prajapati."
4.4.1.14.6	He places it with the words, "For all the gods thee, this is thy place; for all the gods thee."
4.4.1.14.7	For he takes him for all the gods.
4.4.1.14.8	Then he sits down facing east.
4.4.1.15.1	When the Hotṛ recites this verse with one, ten, two, twenty, three, thirty, and a hundred, then he says, "O Vāyu, release them here." The vessels are released in this Vāyu-verse.
4.4.1.15.2	Animals are led by Vāyu.
4.4.1.15.3	Vāyu is indeed Prāṇa.
4.4.1.15.4	For the animals move by means of the breath.
4.4.1.16.1	He (Indra) departed from the gods with the animals.
4.4.1.16.2	The gods invited him at the morning pressing.
4.4.1.16.3	He did not come.
4.4.1.16.4	They invited him at the midday pressing.
4.4.1.16.5	He still did not come. 
4.4.1.16.6	They invited him in the third pressing.
4.4.1.17.1	He was about to leave, and said, "What would be mine if I were to leave?"
4.4.1.17.2	"These vessels would be yoked by you and released by you."
4.4.1.17.3	By this he yokes these vessels, in that he takes the vessels of Indra-Vayu at the morning pressing.
4.4.1.17.4	Then he releases the vessels with this (verse), saying, "O Vayu, release them with your missiles."
4.4.1.17.5	The missiles are indeed cattle.
4.4.1.17.6	Thus he releases the vessels by means of cattle.
4.4.1.18.1	When he was about to turn back from the morning pressing, the morning pressing is indeed the Gayatri, and the Brahman is the Gayatri. The cattle would have been among the Brahmanas.
4.4.1.18.2	Now when he was about to turn back from the midday pressing, for the midday pressing is Indra, and Indra is the Kshatriya, and the cattle would have been among the Kshatriyas.
4.4.1.18.3	And when he turned back from the third pressing, for the third pressing is the All-gods, and all this is the All-Gods, therefore the cattle are here everywhere.
4.4.2.1.1	He proceeds with a cake to Soma.
4.4.2.1.2	Soma is the oblation of the gods.
4.4.2.3.4	Thus he makes the father laugh and rejoice.
4.4.2.3.5	One should not recite the Anuvākyā.
4.4.2.3.6	For the fathers are indeed turned away only once.
4.4.2.3.7	Therefore one should not recite the anuvākyā
4.4.2.4.1	Having taken four spoonfuls of ghee, having announced, "One should offer ghee,"
4.4.2.4.2	One offers at the Vasat-call.
4.4.2.4.3	Those oblations which are offered before this, he makes them disappear.
4.4.2.4.4	Thus he makes it free from injury.
4.4.2.5.1	Having placed the clarified butter, he offers twice from the ladle.
4.4.2.5.2	Then he pours clarified butter over it.
4.4.2.5.3	Having called out, he says, "Do you recite the yajya for Soma."
4.4.2.5.4	At the Vaṣaṭ-call, he offers.
4.4.2.6.1	Then, having taken up the ghee in four spoonfuls, having announced, he says, "One should offer ghee."
4.4.2.6.2	He offers at the Vaṣaṭ-call.
4.4.2.6.3	This is indeed the offering that he is going to make after this. He thus makes it internal.
4.4.2.6.4	Thus he makes it without blemish.
4.4.2.6.5	If he wishes, he should offer on both sides.
4.4.2.6.6	If he so wishes, he should make the offering on one side.
4.4.2.7.1	Then the ladle called Pracarani is used.
4.4.2.7.2	Having taken four spoonfuls of clarified butter in it, the Adhvaryu pours it over the Dhishnyas with the Sala-sticks.
4.4.2.7.3	The reason why he pours the Dhishnyās with the Sala-sticks is this.
4.4.2.7.4	The gods had said to them at that time: "At the third pressing, you will receive the offering of clarified butter, not of Soma.
4.4.2.7.5	For your Soma-drink has been stolen.
4.4.2.7.6	By that (Soma-drink) he offers the Soma-oblation. This oblation of ghee is obtained at the third pressing, not the Soma-oblations.
4.4.2.7.7	When he pours down the Dhishnya-cups with the Sala-sticks, he pours them down in the order in which they were scattered, in the order in the which they were placed.
4.4.2.7.8	The Marjalyi-cup alone is the last.
4.4.2.8.1	Then they pour the libation again at the Agnidhra-chamber, saying, "The sacrifice has been completed."
4.4.2.8.2	But he should not do so.
4.4.2.8.3	Only the last one at the Marjalyan-chamber.
4.4.2.9.1	When the Adhvaryu pours the Dhishnya-cups with the ladle, then the Pratiprasthâtri takes up the Patnivat cup.
4.4.2.9.2	From the sacrifice are born the offspring.
4.4.2.9.3	From the sacrifice are born the offspring; from the pair are born the offspring.
4.4.2.9.4	From the pair are born offspring; from the end of the sacrifice are born offspring.
4.4.2.9.5	From that he generates these offspring from the end of sacrifice, from the generation of the pair.
4.4.2.9.6	From that, from the generation from the pair, from the end of a sacrifice, these offspring are born.
4.4.2.9.7	Therefore he takes the Pātnīvata (cup).
4.4.2.10.1	He takes it with the Upāṁshu-vessel.
4.4.2.10.2	If one were to take Savitr with the Upāmshu-vessel, then this one with the Antaryāma-vessel.
4.4.2.10.3	 If one were to take Sāvitra with the Antaryama-vessel, then with the Upāmsa-vessel.
4.4.2.10.4	For both Upāṁshu and Antaryāma are the same.
4.4.2.10.5	For the breath is the same.
4.4.2.10.6	He who is the breath is the Udanas.
4.4.2.10.7	The bull is the breath.
4.4.2.10.8	The wife is the woman.
4.4.2.10.9	This is indeed the begetting of a couple.
4.4.2.11.1	He takes it without the Puroruk.
4.4.2.11.2	The Puroruk is indeed virility.
4.4.2.11.3	"So that he does not place virility in women."
4.4.2.11.4	Therefore he takes it without the puroruk.
4.4.2.12.1	Then he takes it with, "Thou art taken with the Upayāma-formula. Thou art the Soma of Brihaspati's son, O god Soma, for him."
4.4.2.12.2	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman.
4.4.2.12.3	He says this, "For him, the Soma of the one born from Brahman."
4.4.2.12.4	"For Indra, for the one having power," he says.
4.4.2.12.5	He says, "For the one having power" when he says, "For Indra, for one having power."
4.4.2.12.6	"May I obtain the Grahas with a wife."
4.4.2.12.7	He does not take them from the wives, lest he should place strength in women.
4.4.2.12.8	Therefore he does not take them directly from the wives.
4.4.2.13.1	Then the remaining drops of the Pracharaṇa cup, he anoints him with that.
4.4.2.13.2	He anoints the other Grahas.
4.4.2.13.3	Then he makes it half-cooked.
4.4.2.13.4	The ghee is the thunderbolt.
4.4.2.13.5	With this thunderbolt, the gods struck down their wives.
4.4.2.13.6	They were struck down and slain, and they did not know their own selves nor their property.
4.4.2.13.7	In the same way, he strikes down his wives with this thunderbolt, the ghee.
4.4.2.13.8	They are slain, they are destroyed, they do not care for themselves or for their property.
4.4.2.14.1	He says, 'I am the one beyond, I am the one below; what is the atmosphere, that was my father; I saw the sun on both sides; that is the supreme secret of the gods.'
4.4.2.14.2	When he says, 'I, I', he places the strength of men.
4.4.2.16.2	Tvaṣṭa indeed makes the deposited semen grow.
4.4.2.16.3	He indeed makes the deposited seed grow.
4.4.2.16.4	He offers in the northern half with "Drink Soma, svāhā."
4.4.2.16.5	Those other oblations are the gods.
4.4.2.16.6	And these are the wives.
4.4.2.16.7	For such is the union of the male and female.
4.4.2.16.8	For the woman lies down behind the man.
4.4.2.16.9	The Adhvaryu brings the oblation to the Agnīdhra.
4.4.2.16.10	He says, "O Adhvaryu, do you call me."
4.4.2.16.11	One should not respond to him.
4.4.2.16.12	For who would respond to one who is killed and abandoned?
4.4.2.16.13	One should respond to him. For
4.4.2.16.14	they offer to him in the fire.
4.4.2.16.15	They perform the Vasat-utterance.
4.4.2.16.16	Therefore one should respond to him.
4.4.2.17.1	Then the Adhvaryu, having ordered the fires, approaches the place of the Neshtri. The Neshtri approaches the place of his wife. The Udgātṛ approaches the place of chanting. The Unnetṛ approaches the place for carrying the Soma. The Hotr approaches the place of carrying the Soma cup. "He says, "Do not let the Soma be spilled."
4.4.2.17.2	If it is an Agniṣṭoma,
4.4.2.18.1	If it is a Ukthya, he should say, "Enhance the Soma."
4.4.2.18.2-8	The Nestr, carrying this vessel, approaches the place of the Agnidhra. The Agnidhra is indeed Agni in the sense of origination. The Nestr is a woman. The Agnidh is a bull. The Nestra is a woman. Thus the union is made for procreation. The Neshta leads the wife.
4.4.2.18.9	The Udgātṛ recites it, saying, "Thou art Prajāpati, the bull, the bearer of seed; do thou place seed in me."
4.4.2.18.10	Prajāpati is the Udgātṛ.
4.4.2.18.11	The wife is the woman.
4.4.2.18.12	It is indeed the union that is produced.
4.4.3.1.1	The animals are the metres of the gods.
4.4.3.1.2	Just as animals yoked to men carry them, so the metres yoked to the gods carry the sacrifice.
4.4.3.1.3	When the metres satisfied the gods, then the gods satisfied the metres.
4.4.3.1.4	Therefore, that which was before, the hymns were yoked, they brought the sacrifice to the gods, and they were satisfied with them.
4.4.3.2.1	Then he takes the Hāriyojana.
4.4.3.2.2	The Hāriyojanas are indeed the hymns.
4.4.3.2.3	He thus satisfies the hymns.
4.4.3.2.4	Therefore he takes the Hārīyojana.
4.4.3.3.1	He takes it as an excess.
4.4.3.3.2	When he says, "Now for Shambhu," then he takes it.
4.4.3.3.3	Indeed, the gods, then the metres, then men, then the animals, were in excess.
4.4.3.3.4	Therefore he takes what is in excess.
4.4.3.4.1	He takes it in a pot of a Drona measure.
4.4.3.4.2	Soma was indeed Vritra.
4.4.3.4.3	When the gods killed him, his head turned away.
4.4.3.4.4	It became the Dronakalaśa.
4.4.3.4.5	Whatever quantity of Soma juice flowed into it,
4.4.3.4.6	it was in excess.
4.4.3.4.7	This is an excess (graha).
4.4.3.4.8	He thus places the excess in the excess.
4.4.3.4.9	Therefore he takes it in the Dronakalaša.
4.4.3.5.1	He takes it without the Puroruk.
4.4.3.6.3	For he takes him with the Rk and the Sama.
4.4.3.7.1	Then he pours out the oblations, saying, "The oblations of the tawny ones, together with Soma, for Indra."
4.4.3.7.2	What is measured and what is not measured here, that he now consumes all.
4.4.3.8.1	The pourer calls out to him.
4.4.3.8.2	The pourers are indeed redundant.
4.4.3.8.3	For he does not call out to anyone else.
4.4.3.8.4	This is an extra Graha.
4.4.3.8.5	He places it in the extra (cup) because it is extra.
4.4.3.8.6	Therefore the Unnetr calls (the Hotri).
4.4.3.9.1	Having placed it on the head, he calls.
4.4.3.9.2	For this is the head of it.
4.4.3.9.3	Then he says, "Do thou recite for the Dhānāsomas."
4.4.3.9.4	Having called (the Hotri), he says, "Send forth the Dhānāsoman priests who have started."
4.4.3.9.5	He offers at the Vasat-call and at the Anuvṣat-call.
4.4.3.9.6	Then they take up the Dhānās for eating.
4.4.3.10.1	Some, saying that the Vasat-caller's share is the Dronakalaśa, take it away from the Hotṛ.
4.4.3.10.2	One should not do so.
4.4.3.10.3	The other shares are like the Ācamas.
4.4.3.10.4	This is the extra one.
4.4.3.10.5	Therefore, all of them should eat from it.
4.4.3.10.6	Therefore, they desire to eat from the pot.
4.4.3.11.1	They should not eat with their hands.
4.4.3.11.2	These are indeed animals.
4.4.3.11.3	"Do not let us destroy the animals,"
4.4.3.11.4	they eat with their breath, saying, "The food for horses, the food for cows."
4.4.3.11.5	These are indeed cattle.
4.4.3.11.6	Therefore he says, "Your share is the horse, your share is the cow."
4.4.3.11.7	"For him, for the one who is praised and praised, for the one praised and praised."
4.4.3.11.8	For the praises are the Yajus verses, and the praises are the Stoma.
4.4.3.11.9	"For the one praised and praiseworthy."
4.4.3.11.10	For the praiseworthy are the Uktha verses.
4.4.3.11.11	"For him who is invoked, I eat the share of the invoked."
4.4.3.11.12	For the invited one eats the invited one.
4.4.3.12.1	They should not scatter them into the fire, lest they offer oblations of leftovers into the fire.
4.4.3.12.2	They pour them into the northern Veda.
4.4.3.12.3	Thus they do not go outside the sacrifice.
4.4.3.13.1	Then they mix the full vessels together, which some call "the waters and Soma".
4.4.3.13.2	Just as a yoked (ox) draws, so do those who perform the priestly duties.
4.4.3.13.3	For a yoked (animal) either breaks or is torn apart.
4.4.3.13.4	Water is peace, water is the remedy.
4.4.3.13.5	Whatever they break or tear apart here, they pacify with water, they join with water.
4.4.3.13.6	Therefore they pour water into full vessels.
4.4.3.15.4	They touch it with nectar.
4.4.3.15.5	And they perform this rite in the Self.
4.4.3.15.6	Therefore they touch the mouths.
4.4.4.1.1	He offers nine Samitsya-yajus-offerings.
4.4.4.1.2	When he offers nine Samitsyajus- offerings,
4.4.4.1.3	nine are the Stotriya-verses in the Bahispavamana.
4.4.4.1.4	This Viraj is deficient on both sides for the purpose of reproduction.
4.4.4.1.5	From this reproduction deficient on both sides, Prajapati created beings, both upward and downward.
4.4.4.1.6	In the same way, he creates beings from this reproduction deficient on two sides, both upward and also downward.
4.4.4.2.1	The Hina-sound is the tenth of the Stotriyas, and the Svāhā-sound is the eleventh of them.
4.4.4.2.2	Thus this Viraj becomes deficient by ten.
4.4.4.3.1	Now as to why they are called Samitsya-Jausas.
4.4.4.3.2	All those deities to whom this sacrifice is offered, are all present at it.
4.4.4.5.1	Then he offers three more oblations.
4.4.4.5.2	The deities to whom the sacrifice is offered, come near, thinking, "They are offering to us."
4.4.4.5.3	He releases them in the proper manner, following their footsteps.
4.4.4.6.1	Then he offers three more final oblations.
4.4.4.6.2	This is the sacrifice which he has generated.
4.4.4.6.3	Having generated it, he establishes it in the place where it is established.
4.4.4.6.4	Therefore he offers the Samitsya-yajus.
4.4.4.7.1	He offers with the verse, "O Indra, do thou lead us with thy mind, with thy cows."
4.4.4.7.2	"With mind" - he thus nourishes the one who is exhausted by mind.
4.4.4.7.3	"With cows" - he thus nurishes the one who has been exhausted by cows.
4.4.4.7.4	He unites with the sages, with Maghavan, with welfare, with Brahman, whatever is done by the gods.
4.4.4.7.5	"Brahman" - he thus nourishes the one who is spreading with Brahman.
4.4.4.7.6	"To the good minds of the gods, to the gods who are worthy of sacrifice, svāhā."
4.4.4.8.1	"With splendour, with milk, with bodies."
4.4.4.8.2	"With splendor" - he thus nurtures the one who is expanding with splendor.
4.4.4.8.3	"With milk" -
4.4.4.8.4	The sap is the milk.
4.4.4.8.5	He makes it grow by mixing it with milk.
4.4.4.8.6	We have come with the mind of peace. May Tvashtri, the bountiful, arrange the wealth. May he anoint the body that has been injured."
4.4.4.8.7	He thus restores it to a firm condition.
4.4.4.9.1	Dhātar, Rati, Savitar, Prajāpati, the lord of treasures, the god Agni, Tvashtri, Vishnu, may they bestow prosperity on the sacrificer, Svāhā.
4.4.4.9.2	He thus again nourishes the one who is dwindling when he says, "May they bestow prosperity on sacrificer, Svāhà."
4.4.4.10.1	May the gods have made your seats auspicious, those who have come here to enjoy this libation.
4.4.4.10.2	He says this, 'May the gods have made for you auspicious seats, those who have approached here to enjoy this offering.'
4.4.4.10.3	'Bearing, carrying the oblations,' thus he releases the deities.
4.4.4.10.4	'May those who are your bearers come to you.
4.4.4.10.5	"May those who are carrying (the oblations) come to thee, who have the means of carrying (them)." So he says.
4.4.4.10.6	"Therefore he says: 'The bearers, the carriers, may the Vasus bestow on us the oblations and the treasures, svāhā!'
4.4.4.11.1	'O god, thou hast brought the gods, O god, thou hast sent them to their own place in the fire.'
4.4.4.11.2	He says to Agni: 'Bring the gods, bring the gods.'
4.4.4.11.3	He thereby says, "Take them to those gods whom you have invoked; go to wherever they have their abode."
4.4.4.11.4	"Those who have eaten and drunk,"
4.4.4.11.5	For those who have eaten and have drunk are the animals and the sacrificial cake.
4.4.4.11.6	"Those who drank,"
4.4.4.11.7	For those that have drunk are the Soma-juice.
4.4.4.11.8	Therefore he says, "Those who eat and drink are all gods. They have stood in the heat. Svāhā!"
4.4.4.11.9	He thus releases the deities.
4.4.4.12.1	"We have chosen you, O Agni, as the Hotṛ at this sacrifice. May we prosper. May we prosper through you, O most prosperous one. Knowing, come to the sacrifice, O wise one. Svāhā!"
4.4.4.12.2	He releases Agni by means of this (verse).
4.4.4.12.3	He releases Agni.
4.4.4.13.1	"The gods who know the way."
4.4.4.13.2	For the gods do know the way.
4.4.4.13.3	"They know the way." He says this.
4.4.4.13.4	"They have known the sacrifice."
4.4.4.13.5	"They have gone the way."
4.4.4.13.6	He releases it in accordance with the way.
4.4.4.13.7	O lord of mind, this divine sacrifice, svāhā to Vāta and Dhā.
4.4.4.13.8	This indeed is the sacrifice, which blows here.
4.4.4.13.9	Having thus collected this sacrifice, he establishes it in this sacrifice.
4.4.4.13.10	He unites the sacrifice with the sacrifice.
4.4.4.13.11	Therefore he says, "Svāhā to the wind."
4.4.4.14.1	"Go to the sacrifice, go to the lord of sacrifice, go to your own place, svāhā."
4.4.4.14.2	This indeed is the established sacrifice, he establishes it in its own place.
4.4.4.14.3	"This is your sacrifice, O Lord of sacrifice, with the recitation of the Sūkta, with all heroes, do you accept it, svāhā."
4.4.4.14.4	This indeed is the established, sacrifice, with the reciting of the Sūktas, with all heroes; he establishes it in the sacrificer at the end.
4.4.5.1.1	He then enters the Avabhṛtha.
4.4.5.1.2	When he enters the Avabhṛtha (rite),
4.4.5.1.3	the juice which was his, is generated from the oblations.
4.4.5.1.4	Then this body, in which there is no juice,
4.4.5.1.5	is not his.
4.4.5.1.6	They bring him water.
4.4.5.1.7	Water is juice.
4.4.5.1.8	He places this juice in it.
4.4.5.1.9	He unites him with this juice.
4.4.5.1.10	He generates him from that.
4.4.5.1.11	He generates him even when he is born.
4.4.5.1.12	When they bring the water, it is Avabhṛtha.
4.4.5.2.1	Then he offers the Samitsya-yajus.
4.4.5.2.2	The Samitsya-Yajus are indeed the end of the sacrifice.
4.4.5.2.3	Having offered the Samitsya Yajus, he approaches the Cātvāla with what is around it.
4.4.5.2.4	He throws the girdle of the black antelope skin and the wooden sword into the water.
4.4.5.3.1	"He says, "May the earth be mine, may I not be separated from it."
4.4.5.3.2	This is the proper form of the Rgīsa grass, for they bring it down with water.
4.4.5.3.3	This is the right form of it.
4.4.5.3.4	Snakes are like a rope.
4.4.5.3.5	The abodes of snakes are like wells.
4.4.5.3.6	There is a rivalry between men and serpents, as it were. Let it not arise from this.
4.4.5.3.7	Therefore he says, "May the earth be mine, may it not be taken away from me."
4.4.5.4.1	Then he recites, "The king Varuna has made a wide path for the sun to follow."
4.4.5.4.2	"Just as this path of the sun is wide, fearless, and free from danger, so may this path of mine be wide, fearless, free from danger." Thus he says.
4.4.5.5.1	"For the foot to be placed down, for the foot to be lifted up."
4.4.5.5.2	If one's foot is injured, one is still able to walk.
4.4.5.5.3	"The heart-piercing one, the one who speaks."
4.4.5.5.4	Then he releases him from all the heart-disease, from all sin.
4.4.5.6.1	Then he says, "Sing the Sama." Or he says, "Recite the Sama."
4.4.5.6.2	One should say, "Sing."
4.4.5.6.3	For they sing the Sama.
4.4.5.6.4	When he sings the Sama, it is with the thought, "May this body not be outside the sacrifice, may the demons and the Rakshasas not destroy it."
4.4.5.6.5	For the Sama is the destroyer of the demons and the Raksasas.
4.4.5.7.1	He sings in the Agniyesti.
4.4.5.7.2	For Agni is the destroyer of the Raksases.
4.4.5.7.3	He sings in the Atichandas.
4.4.5.7.4	This is all the metres, namely the Atichandas;
4.4.5.7.5	therefore he sings in the Ati- chandas.
4.4.5.8.1	He sings, 'Agni burns, he burns back, the days, the days.'
4.4.5.8.2	Thus he drives away the Raksases and the evil spirits.
4.4.5.9.1	They go out towards the north, with their backs towards the sacrificial post and towards the Agni-dhrā.
4.4.5.9.2	They go to that direction where the waters are.
4.4.5.10.1	He should go to the pool of the flowing waters which is firm.
4.4.5.10.2	These are the waters which are held by Varuna, those which do not flow among the flowing waters.
4.4.5.10.3	Varuna's is the Avabhrtha, for the sake of being free from Varuna.
4.4.5.10.4	If one does not find them, one should recite over whatever water one may come across.
4.4.5.11.1	Reciting over the water, one says, "Salutations to Varuna, the noose of Varuna is bound."
4.4.5.11.2	He thus releases him from all the noose of varuna, from all the varuna.
4.4.5.12.1	Then, having taken up four spoonfuls of clarified butter, he offers the kindling wood with the verse, "Agni has entered the waters, protecting the rain of waters, the non-shining, in each dam. O Agni, I offer the kindling wood. Your tongue has come forth to drink the clarified butter. Svāhā!"
4.4.5.13.1	The gods, indeed, made Agni enter the water, as much as it was, as much as there was, so that the evil spirits and the Rakshas would not rise up from here.
4.4.5.13.2	For Agni is the destroyer of the Rakshas.
4.4.5.13.3	He kindles him with this kindling-wood and this oblation, thinking, "Having kindled him, I shall offer to the gods."
4.4.5.14.1	Then, having taken up the fourfold clarified butter, having announced, he says, "Do you offer the kindling wood."
4.4.5.14.2	He offers four Prayāja offerings without the sacrificial grass.
4.4.5.14.3	Sacrificial grass is offspring.
4.4.5.14.4	The Avabhṛtha rite belongs to Varuna.
4.4.5.14.5	"Let not offspring be seized by Varuna,"
4.4.5.14.6	Therefore he offers four Prayāja-offerings without the sacrificial grass.
4.4.5.15.1-8	Then there is a single-pot cake for Varuna. Whatever juice there was in him, that he generated from the oblations. Then this body. There is no juice in it. The cake is juice. He places this juice in it. He unites him with this juice. He generates him from this.
4.4.5.15.9	He generates it as soon as it is born.
4.4.5.15.10	Therefore the Varuna oblation is a cake on one potsherd.
4.4.5.16.1	Having placed the clarified butter, he offers the cake, saying, "Recite to Varuna."
4.4.5.16.2	Here some offer twice of the flour.
4.4.5.16.3	One should not do so.
4.4.5.16.4	This is indeed the body, not the oblation.
4.4.5.16.5	He offers twice.
4.4.5.16.6	He pours it once.
4.4.5.16.7	He pours out the oblation with the formula.
4.4.5.16.8	Having called out, he says, "Do you recite the yajus for Varuna."
4.4.5.16.9	He offers at the Vasat-utterance.
4.4.5.17.1	Having placed the clarified butter and the cake, he says, “Do you recite the formula for Agni and Varuna.”
4.4.5.17.2	This is for Sviṣṭakṛt.
4.4.5.17.3	If he says, "For Agni," then Varuna would not take Agni.
4.4.5.17.4	If he is to offer twice in the other (fire), then once here.
4.4.5.17.5	If he does not care,
4.4.5.17.6	then he pours twice over the clarified butter from above.
4.4.5.17.7	Having called out, he says, "One should offer to Agni and Varuna."
4.4.5.17.8	He offers at the Vasat-utterance.
4.4.5.18.1	These are indeed six oblations.
4.4.5.18.2	There are six seasons in a year.
4.4.5.18.3	Varuna is the year.
4.4.5.18.4	Therefore there are six oblations.
4.4.5.19.1	This is the path of the Adityas.
4.4.5.19.2	They say these are the Adityas' mantras.
4.4.5.19.3	One should do this only as long as one is under his control.
4.4.5.19.4	If the sacrificer were to tell him to do something else, then he should do it.
4.4.5.19.5	He should offer these four Prāyājas without the sacrificial grass, two Ajyabhāgas, Varuna, Agni-Varuna, and two Anuyājas without the sacrificial grasses.
4.4.5.19.6	That makes ten.
4.4.5.19.7	The Viraj has ten syllables.
4.4.5.19.8	The sacrifice is Viraj.
4.4.5.19.9	Thus he accomplishes the Viraj sacrifice.
4.4.5.20.1	This is the path of the Angirasas.
4.4.5.20.2	Having done either of these, he sprinkles the pot in which there is flour with water, saying, "Your heart is in the sea, in the waters."
4.4.5.20.3	The sea is indeed the waters.
4.4.5.20.4	The waters are indeed the sap.
4.4.5.20.5	He places this sap in it.
4.4.5.20.6	He unites him with this sap.
4.4.5.20.7	He generates him from this.
4.4.5.20.8	He generates it in him as soon as he is born.
4.4.5.20.9	"May the plants enter you, and the water."
4.4.5.20.10	He places both the essence in him, that which is in the plants and that which is in water.
4.4.5.20.11	"We worship you, O Lord of sacrifice, at the invocation and praise of the sacrifice, with 'Svāhā!'
4.4.5.20.12	Whatever is good in the sacrifice, that he places in him.
4.4.5.21.1	Then, having followed him, he stands up, saying, "This is your embryo, O divine waters."
4.4.5.21.2	For this is the embryo of the waters.
4.4.5.21.3	"You hold him well-pleased, well-nourished," thus he gives him over to the waters for protection.
4.4.5.21.4	"This is your world, O divine Soma."
4.4.5.21.5	For the waters are his world. "In that (world) do you rejoice and protect!"
4.4.5.21.6	"May it protect us from all calamities."
4.4.5.22.1	Then he says, "O Avabhrtha, O Nicumpun, O Niceru, O Nicumpuna, I am going to the divine and human created sin."
4.4.5.22.2	For the gods, indeed, have gone away from the sin committed by the gods, with Soma, the king.
4.4.5.22.3	For the men, indeed, have now gone away from the mortal sin committed by the mortals, with the animal-offering and the cake.
4.4.5.22.4	"O god, protect us from all sins."
4.4.5.22.5	He says this: "Protect us from all mortal sins."
4.4.5.23.1	Then, having bathed, they run on each other's backs.
4.4.5.23.2	They put on other clothes and come out.
4.4.5.23.3	Just as a snake sheds its skin, so he is freed from all sin.
4.4.5.23.4	Until he is given to the prince, he is not considered a man.
4.4.5.23.5	By the same way by which they go out, they return.
4.4.5.23.6	Having come back, he places the kindling-wood on the Āhavanīya with the formula, "Thou art the kindling- wood of the gods."
4.4.5.23.7	He kindles the sacrificer with this.
4.4.5.23.8	The sacrificer is kindled in accordance with the kindling-woods of the gods.
7.1.1.1.1	One who is going to make the Garhapatya fire, sweeps it with a Palāśa branch.
7.1.1.1.2	When one makes the Garhapaty fire, it is as if he is sweeping.
7.1.1.1.3	Those who have built the fire, they have settled down here.
7.1.1.1.4	When he builds up the fire, he builds up those who have settled down.
7.1.1.1.5	So that he does not settle down on those who have settled.
7.1.1.2.1	"He has gone, he has gone, he is creeping away."
7.1.1.2.2	He has gone and he has gone and he is creeping away.
7.1.1.2.3	He says this to those who have settled in the belly of the fire.
7.1.1.2.4	Those who are here, the old and the new.
7.1.1.2.5	Those who are here, those who are eternal and those who are recent. This is it.
7.1.1.3.1	Yama gave the end of the earth.
7.1.1.3.2	Yama indeed is the end of this.
7.1.1.3.3	He himself gives him the end of this here.
7.1.1.4.1	The fathers made this world for us.
7.1.1.4.2	Yama is indeed the kshatra.
7.1.1.4.3	The Visas are the fathers.
7.1.1.4.4	For he who, being a Kshatriya, has made peace with the Visas, gives them a place to stay here, that is well-given.
7.1.1.4.5	So also for him, Yama, having made peace with the fathers and the Visas, grants a place to stay in this world.
7.1.1.5.1	He sweeps with a Palasa branch.
7.1.1.5.2	Palasa is indeed Brahman.
7.1.1.5.3	With Brahman he sweeps those who have been settled.
7.1.1.5.4	with a mantra.
7.1.1.5.5	Brahma is indeed the mantra.
7.1.1.5.6	He draws them out with Brahma alone.
7.1.1.5.7	He places them towards the north.
7.1.1.6.1	Then he sows the seeds.
7.1.1.6.2	This world is the Garhapatya.
7.1.1.6.3	The seeds are the animals.
7.1.1.6.4	He places the animals in this world.
7.1.1.6.5	Therefore, these animals are in this world.
7.1.1.7.1	Now, indeed, he scatters the seeds of the Uṣa.
7.1.1.7.2	Prajapati created the creatures.
7.1.1.7.3	He created them with different sheaths.
7.1.1.7.4	They did not recognize each other.
7.1.1.7.5	He desired, "May they recognize each other."
7.1.1.7.6	He made them with the same sheaths.
7.1.1.7.7	He made the Uṣa the sheath of them.
7.1.1.7.8	They recognized each other.
7.1.1.7.9	Even now, those with the same sheathes recognize each other.
7.1.1.7.10	"He who sacrifices is equal to the gods in strength."
7.1.1.7.11	When he scatters the ashes, he becomes equal to the gods.
7.1.1.8.1	"You are the sign."
7.1.1.8.2	Because one recognizes through it.
7.1.1.8.3	"You grant what is desired."
7.1.1.8.4	The ashes are cattle, and what is desired is cattle.
7.1.1.8.5	"May what is desired be yours in me."
7.1.1.8.6	"May your cattle be in me." This is what it means.
7.1.1.8.7	He covers the entire Garhapatya with them.
7.1.1.8.8	The Garhapatya is the womb, the kindling wood is the seed.
7.1.1.8.9	The ashes are the covering.
7.1.1.8.10	He covers all the womb with the covering.
7.1.1.9.1	Then he pours sand.
7.1.1.9.2	This is the ash of Agni Vaisvānara.
7.1.1.9.3	He who is about to offer Agni Vaiśvānara,
7.1.1.9.4	Agni does not burn his own ashes. For non-burning,
7.1.1.10.1	He pours sand.
7.1.1.10.2	Sand is the seed of Agni Vaiśvânara.
7.1.1.10.3	He who is about to make an offering to Agni Vaiśvânarend
7.1.1.10.4	Nothing is produced from the seedless. From this seed, it is produced.
7.1.1.11.1	"You are the ashes of Agni, you are the excrement of Agni."
7.1.1.11.2	The ashes of Agni are exhausted.
7.1.1.11.3	The sand is not exhausted.
7.1.1.11.4	He makes it not exhausted.
7.1.1.11.5	With them he covers the entire Garhapatya.
7.1.1.11.6	The Garhapatya is the womb.
7.1.1.11.7	The seed is sand.
7.1.1.11.8	He places the seed in the womb of all.
7.1.1.12.1	Then he encloses it with the enclosing sticks.
7.1.1.12.2	The enclosing sticks are the womb.
7.1.1.12.3	He encloses the seed that has been sprinkled with the womb.
7.1.1.12.4	Therefore the seed that has sprinkled is enclosed with the womb.
7.1.1.13.1-7	Now, when he encloses him with the enclosing sticks, this world is the Gārhapatya, the enclosing sticks are the waters, he encloses this world with water, he encircles it with the ocean, from all sides the ocean encircles this world from all sides.
7.1.1.13.8	Therefore the ocean flows around this world in a clockwise direction.
7.1.1.13.9	With a trench.
7.1.1.13.10	Therefore the ocean flows around the world with a trench.
7.1.1.14.1	With a mound.
7.1.1.14.2	He indeed builds them up.
7.1.1.14.3	With a surrounding mound.
7.1.1.14.4	He builds them up surrounding.
7.1.1.14.5	Build up the mound upwards.
7.1.1.14.6	He says while placing the mound upwards.
7.1.1.14.7	Therefore the ocean is victorious above it.
7.1.1.14.8	If he were to place it obliquely, then this entire world would be wiped out by the ocean at once.
7.1.1.14.9	He does not press it down.
7.1.1.14.10	For water is not pressed down.
7.1.1.14.11	He does neither recite the Sūdadoha nor the Adhividha.
7.1.1.15.1	The Pariśrita is bones.
7.1.1.15.2	The Sūdadoha is the vital breath.
7.1.1.15.3	There is no vital breath in bones.
7.1.1.15.4	With one Yajus he lays down many bricks.
7.1.1.15.5	For water is one form.
7.1.1.15.6	And because there are many (bricks) in the enclosing stones, for there are many waters.
7.1.1.16.1	The enclosing stones are the womb.
7.1.1.16.2	The sand is the placenta.
7.1.1.16.3	The semen is the gravel.
7.1.1.16.4	The enclosing stone is outside, the sand is inside.
7.1.1.16.5	The external one is the womb, the internal one is the embryo.
7.1.1.16.6	The external ones are sand, the internal ones are gravel.
7.1.1.16.7	The external one is the embryo, the internal one the semen.
7.1.1.16.8	From these he is born when he is born.
7.1.1.16.9	He generates him from these alone.
7.1.1.17.1	Then he cuts it from there.
7.1.1.17.2	Here he makes the deposited semen grow.
7.1.1.17.3	Therefore, the semen deposited in the womb is transformed.
7.1.1.18.1	He places four bricks towards the east, two towards the west, and two towards the north.
7.1.1.18.2	Those which are placed towards the east are the body.
7.1.1.18.3	The reason they are four is that this body is of four kinds.
7.1.1.18.4	Those which come towards the west are the thighs.
7.1.1.18.5	Those which go towards the east are arms.
7.1.1.18.6	Where there is the self, that is the head.
7.1.1.19.1	Here he makes him with wings and tail.
7.1.1.19.2	Whatever form the semen takes in the womb, that it becomes.
7.1.1.19.3	Since he makes him here with wings and tail, therefore he is born here with wings and a tail.
7.1.1.21.3	He places the first brick towards the north, while sitting towards the south, facing the northern half.
7.1.1.21.4	Thus indeed, his Agni becomes built towards himself.
7.1.1.22.1	"This is that Agni in whom Indra placed the Soma, the pressed (Soma)."
7.1.1.22.2	This world is the Garhapatya.
7.1.1.22.3	Water is Soma.
7.1.1.22.4	Indra placed it in this world in water.
7.1.1.22.5	In the belly, indeed, is the (sacrificial) food.
7.1.1.22.6	The belly is the middle.
7.1.1.22.7	The thousand-fold, the strong, the swift, the seven-fold.
7.1.1.22.8	The thousandfold strong is the water.
7.1.1.22.9	Thou art praised, O Jātavedas, with the Soma.
7.1.1.22.10	Thou art being praised, O Jata-veda. This is what is meant.
7.1.1.23.1	O Agni, thy radiance in heaven.
7.1.1.23.2	The sun is his radiance in heaven.
7.1.1.23.3	On the earth.
7.1.1.23.4	This Agni is on the earth.
7.1.1.23.5	In the plants, in the waters, in the sacrifice.
7.1.1.23.6	He says this to that Agni who is in the plants and in the waters.
7.1.1.23.7	With which you have spread the sky.
7.1.1.23.8	That is Vayu. But he is this.
7.1.1.23.9	He is the shining, the ocean, the eye of men.
7.1.1.23.10	The great sun is the ocean, the eye of men. This is it.
7.1.1.24.1	"Agni, the ocean of heaven, has sought the light."
7.1.1.24.2	The waters are his ocean of heaven.
7.1.1.24.3	He covers them with smoke.
7.1.1.24.4	"He says, 'You have spoken to the gods, the leaders.'
7.1.1.24.5	The gods are the leaders."
7.1.1.24.6	They indeed lead all thoughts.
7.1.1.24.7	The waters which are beyond the shining sun and those which are below, they stand.
7.1.1.24.8	This world is called 'shining', where this shines.
7.1.1.24.9	Those which are beyond it and those which are before it, they are called here.
7.1.1.25.1	The fires of the Pūrus.
7.1.1.25.2	The fires belonging to the cattle.
7.1.1.25.3	With those who are in the Prāvaṇa (direction).
7.1.1.25.4	The form of Prāvaṇa.
7.1.1.25.5	This is the final destination of Agni, namely the Garhapatya.
7.1.1.25.6	"May they enjoy the sacrifice, the unerring, the great powers of food."
7.1.1.25.7	"May they, the unerring ones, enjoy the sacrifice, great powers of food," so it is said.
7.1.1.26.1	He places them separately.
7.1.1.26.2	He places those who have different desires in the self.
7.1.1.26.3	He settles them together.
7.1.1.26.4	He makes it one with himself.
7.1.1.26.5	He recites the Sūdadoha verse.
7.1.1.26.6	The Sūdadoha is the vital breath.
7.1.1.26.7	By means of the vital breath he nourishes and unites it.
7.1.1.27.1	Having gone around by the southern side and having sat down in the north, he places the southern one at the front of the two.
7.1.1.27.2	"O Agni, the giver of many gifts, the giver of wealth, the giver of cattle."
7.1.1.27.3	The Ida is the cattle.
7.1.1.27.4	He wishes for the blessing of the animals.
7.1.1.27.5	He makes the offering to the one who is most worthy of being invoked.
7.1.1.27.6	The one who is invoked is the sacrificer.
7.1.1.27.7	"May our son, our offspring, be in the house."
7.1.1.27.8	The offspring is the progeny.
7.1.1.27.9	"May your good will be for us." He wishes for a blessing.
7.1.1.28.1	Then the northern one.
7.1.1.28.2	This is your womb, the seasonal one, from which you have been born shining.
7.1.1.28.3	This is your womb, eternal, from which you were born shining.
7.1.1.28.4	Knowing that, O Agni, you have ascended. Increase our wealth.
7.1.1.28.5	As the Yajus, so the relationship.
7.1.1.29.1	These are his thighs.
7.1.1.29.2-9	He places them separately, settles them separately, and recites the Sūdadoha separately over them. The two thighs are different. There are two of them. The thighs are two. He places them at the back. The thighs lie at the back. They touch each other at the front. The thighs touch each other at their front ends.
7.1.1.30.1	Then, having gone around by the same (right) way, and having sat down towards the south with his face towards the north, he places the northern one of the two (bricks) in front, with the tip towards the east.
7.1.1.30.2	"Thou art the enclosing (brick); with that deity do thou be firm like Angiras."
7.1.1.30.3	Then the southern one.
7.1.1.30.4	"Thou are the enclosing (brick) ; with that deity do you be firm like Angira."
7.1.1.31.1	These are his arms.
7.1.1.31.2	He places them in different ways, settles them in different ways and recites the Sūdadoha verse in different ways.
7.1.1.31.3	These two arms are different.
7.1.1.31.4	They become two.
7.1.1.31.5	These two are arms.
7.1.1.31.6	He places the eastern half.
7.1.1.31.7	The arms are in front.
7.1.1.31.8	They touch each other at the tips.
7.1.1.31.9	Thus these two arms touch each other at their tips.
7.1.1.31.10	He places these two. These two are.
7.1.1.31.11	That is the right-hand direction.
7.1.1.31.12	That is the divine.
7.1.1.32.1	He lays down eight bricks.
7.1.1.32.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
7.1.1.32.3	Agni is Gayatri.
7.1.1.32.4	He builds him up to the extent that Agni is and to the extent that his measure is.
7.1.1.32.5	He settles it five times.
7.1.1.32.6	Agni has five layers.
7.1.1.32.7	The year has five seasons.
7.1.1.32.8	The year is Agni.
7.1.1.32.9	He builds him as big as Agni is, as big as his measure is.
7.1.1.32.10	He lays down eight bricks in five layers.
7.1.1.32.11	That makes thirteen.
7.1.1.32.12	Thirteen months are a year.
7.1.1.32.13	Thirteen are the layers of Agni.
7.1.1.32.14	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, so much does it become.
7.1.1.33.1	Then he lays down the Lokampṛṇā.
7.1.1.33.2	Its upper part is the bond.
7.1.1.33.3	Three are in the east.
7.1.1.33.4	Agni is threefold.
7.1.1.33.5	As much as Agni is and as much as is its measure, so much he thus builds him.
7.1.1.33.6	Ten are in the north.
7.1.1.33.7	Their upper part is the Bond.
7.1.1.33.8	Two at the beginning, then ten, then one.
7.1.1.33.9	Thus they build the altar.
7.1.1.33.10	They come to be thirteen.
7.1.1.33.11	Its relation has been explained.
7.1.1.34.1	They come together to be twenty-one.
7.1.1.34.2	Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun is the twenty-first.
7.1.1.34.3	He establishes that sun in this fire.
7.1.1.35.1	The Parishrita has twenty-one (bricks).
7.1.1.35.2	Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, this Agni, and yonder one, are twenty-one.
7.1.1.35.3	He thus establishes this Agni in yonder sun.
7.1.1.35.4	And in that he lays down these (bricks), he thus establishes them in each other.
7.1.1.35.5	They are established in each other.
7.1.1.35.6	Here he accomplishes these two as the one twenty-one.
7.1.1.35.7	For here these two are both, the Ahavaniya and the Garhapatya.
7.1.1.36.1	Then he pours down the soil.
7.1.1.36.2	On it is the binding.
7.1.1.36.3	He brings it from the boundary of the Chaitral.
7.1.1.36.4	This is Agni, the Chaitral.
7.1.1.36.5	Thus it is indeed the Agniya (Agni-related) rite.
7.1.1.36.6	It should be with a hole.
7.1.1.36.7	Its relation has been stated.
7.1.1.37.1	It is of the size of a vyāma.
7.1.1.37.2	A man is of the size equal to a vyāma
7.1.1.37.3	Man is Prajapati.
7.1.1.37.4	Prajapati is Agni.
7.1.1.37.5	He makes the womb of the size of his own body.
7.1.1.37.6	It is round.
7.1.1.37.7	The womb is round.
7.1.1.37.8	Now this world is the Gārhapatya.
7.1.1.37.9	This world is round.
7.1.1.38.1	Then he puts them down together.
7.1.1.38.2	He thus makes them have the same name.
7.1.1.38.3	"May your minds and your vows be united, O Agni, may you be united with us."
7.1.1.38.4	He thus appeases them for non-injury, so that they may not injure each other.
7.1.1.39.1	He puts them down with four (verses).
7.1.1.39.2	He thus makes them known by those animals which have four feet.
7.1.1.39.3	And animals are food.
7.1.1.39.4	He thus makes it known by food.
7.1.1.40.1	He should not look at it empty, lest he should look at it empty.
7.1.1.40.2	If he looks at it empty, he swallows it.
7.1.1.41.1	Then he pours sand on it.
7.1.1.41.2	Sand is the seed of Agni Vaisvānara.
7.1.1.41.3	He thus pours on it the seed of Agni, in the form of Vaisvānaran.
7.1.1.41.4	It should have a hole.
7.1.1.41.5	The significance of this has been explained.
7.1.1.42.1	Then he releases it, not to be destroyed.
7.1.1.42.2	What is united and not released, that is burned.
7.1.1.42.3	This is the semen that was united.
7.1.1.42.4	This is Agni, he generated him here.
7.1.1.42.5	Then he puts another one.
7.1.1.42.6	The cauldron is a woman.
7.1.1.42.7	Therefore when a woman generates semen first, then she puts another one.
7.1.1.43.1	"The earth is like a mother to her son, the man."
7.1.1.43.2	"The earth is like the mother to her son."
7.1.1.43.3	"The Agni is like the cattle."
7.1.1.43.4	"He placed Agni in his own abode, in the pot."
7.1.1.43.5	"He put Agni in his own home, in the pot," is what is meant.
7.1.1.43.6	"May Prajapati, the creator of all, released by all the gods and the seasons, let it go."
7.1.1.43.7	The Visve Devas are the seasons.
7.1.1.43.8	Prajapati, the creator of all, releases her, knowing her, with the Visve Devas and the seasons.
7.1.1.43.9	He places her north of the fire at a distance of an arm's length.
7.1.1.43.10	Its relation has been stated.
7.1.1.44.1	Now he brings milk to it.
7.1.1.44.2	This is the semen that is deposited.
7.1.1.44.3	Now he deposits milk.
7.1.1.44.4	The cauldron is a woman.
7.1.1.44.5	Therefore, when a woman conceives semen, then she conceives milk.
7.1.1.44.6	The lower ones are sand, the upper one is milk.
7.1.1.44.7	For the lower one is semen, the upper one milk.
7.1.1.44.8	He brings it in the middle so that it would be placed on the head of a man.
7.1.2.1.1	Prajapati created beings.
7.1.2.1.2	Having created beings, he went to the end of all the races and became exhausted.
7.1.2.1.3	Therefore, from that relaxed (body), Prāṇa emerged in the middle.
7.1.2.1.4	Then from that (body), Vīrya emerged.
7.1.2.1.5	When that (Vīrya) emerged, it became a body.
7.1.2.1.6	From that body, food flowed.
7.1.2.1.7	What was the eye, from that food flowed.
7.1.2.1.8	There was no support here then.
7.1.2.2.1	Those gods said: There is no other support here.
7.1.2.2.2	We shall perform the funeral rites of this father, Prajapati, over you.
7.1.2.2.3	That alone will be our support."
7.1.2.3.1	They said to Agni, "There is no other support here than you.
7.1.2.3.2	We shall perform the funeral rite of this father, the Prajapati, on you.
7.1.2.3.3	That will be our support.
7.1.2.3.4	What will happen to me then?"
7.1.2.4.1-6	They said, "This is food, this is Prajapati." "We shall give this food through your mouth." "This food will not be yours through your mouth." Thus it was. Therefore the gods eat food through Agni's mouth. For whatever deity one offers, one offers in Agni.
7.1.2.4.7	For the gods made food with Agni as their mouth.
7.1.2.5.1	The breath that went out from the middle of him is this very wind that blows.
7.1.2.5.2	And what went out from him as strength is that very sun.
7.1.2.5.3	And what flowed out from him as food is the food that there is in a year.
7.1.2.6.1	The gods put him into the fire.
7.1.2.6.2	That Agni ascended him when he was put in, and that very breath which had gone out from him in the middle, that very thing came back to him and they put it into him.
7.1.2.6.3	And that vigour which went out from him, that they put into him.
7.1.2.6.4	Then what flowed from him, they placed in him.
7.1.2.6.5	Having prepared all that completely, they placed it upwards.
7.1.2.6.6	That which they placed upwards, these are the worlds.
7.1.2.7.1	This world alone is his support.
7.1.2.7.2	Then the Agni in this world is his mouth-breath.
7.1.2.7.3	Then his atmosphere is the Self.
7.1.2.7.4	Now that wind which is in the atmosphere, and that breath which is in the body, that is his (head).
7.1.2.7.5	The sky is his head.
7.1.2.7.6	The sun and moon are his eyes.
7.1.2.7.7	The eye which is closed is the moon.
7.1.2.7.8	Therefore it is more closed.
7.1.2.7.9	Food flowed from it.
7.1.2.8.1	That is the very foundation which the gods established.
7.1.2.8.2	This very same is the foundation even today.
7.1.2.8.3	This very same will be in the future.
7.1.2.9.1	He who is Prajapati, who is falling down, is this very Agni who is being piled up.
7.1.2.9.2	That which this (earth) is empty and lying down, before the expulsion (of the seed), as indeed Prajapati lay down empty when the vital breath had departed, when the vigour had departed, when food had flowed away, that is its form.
7.1.2.10.1	He puts it into the fire.
7.1.2.10.2	Just as the gods then covered him, so he who ascends Agni when she is covered, that very life-breath which had gone out from him in the middle, that he obtains and places in him.
7.1.2.10.3	And when he takes up the golden (Agni) and carries it, that very strength which had gone out of him, that he places in him.
7.1.2.11.5	Because he has come forth from them, therefore he places all this in him.
7.1.2.11.6	In whom this is done, one should not do it for him. This should not be placed in him.
7.1.2.11.7	The teacher Vamakakshayana said, "One should not be a teacher for less than a year. One should not see one's father, Prajapati, being cut off."
7.1.2.11.8	Having completed the entire year, he raises it upwards, as the gods raised it before.
7.1.2.12.1	His Garhapatya is indeed this world.
7.1.2.12.2	Now the fire on the Gārhapatya is the same as the fire in this world.
7.1.2.12.3	Now that which is between the Āhavanīya and the Gārha-patya is the atmosphere.
7.1.2.12.4	Now the fire on the Agnidhriya is the same as Vāyu in the atmosphere.
7.1.2.12.5	The Āhavanīya is the sameas heaven.
7.1.2.12.6	Now the fire on the Ahavaniya is the sun and moon.
7.1.2.12.7	This is his own self.
7.1.2.13.1	His head is the Ahavaniya.
7.1.2.13.2	And the fire on the Ahāvaniya is the breath in the head here. That is his.
7.1.2.13.3	That it has wings and a tail, for the breath in the top of the head here has wings and a Tail.
7.1.2.13.4	The eye is the head.
7.1.2.13.5	The right ear is the right wing.
7.1.2.13.6	The left ear is the left wing.
7.1.2.13.7	The Prāṇa is the middle self.
7.1.2.13.8	Speech is the tail, the support.
7.1.2.13.9	For when the Prāṇas have eaten food through speech, they stand firm. Therefore speech is the tail, support.
7.1.2.14.1	Now that which is between the Āhavanīya and the Garhapatya, that is the self.
7.1.2.14.2	Now the fire in the Agnidhra chamber is the same as the breath within the body.
7.1.2.14.3	The Garhapatya is his support.
7.1.2.14.4	Now the fire in the Garhapatya chamber is the same breath which is in the mouth.
7.1.2.15.1	Some indeed build it with three layers, saying, "These three are the breaths in the mouth."
7.1.2.15.2	One should not do so.
7.1.2.15.3	They make it too much.
7.1.2.15.4	Those who perform the Ekavimsa, Anushtup, and Brihatisampada.
7.1.2.15.5	This is indeed one form, the womb itself.
7.1.2.15.6	The offspring itself are these downward-moving breaths.
7.1.2.15.7	What one does with urine and feces, that is born again.
7.1.2.16.1	Now, indeed, the twenty-one bricks are the nine formulas.
7.1.2.16.2	That is thirty.
7.1.2.16.3	The laying down and the Sūdadohas.
7.1.2.16.4	That is the thirty-two.
7.1.2.16.5	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
7.1.2.16.6	That is indeed the Anushtubh.
7.1.2.17.1	The Pariṣrita has twenty-one.
7.1.2.17.2	The Yajus has twenty-two.
7.1.2.17.3	The Yajus for Vyudūhana, the Yajus for Uṣa, the Yajuses for sand, and the Yajus of excrement.
7.1.2.17.4	He puts down with four (verses).
7.1.2.17.5	He releases with the fifth.
7.1.2.17.6	Then with three (verses), this is the Anushtubh of thirty-two syllables.
7.1.2.17.7	This is the Anushtup.
7.1.2.18.1	Now these two Yajuses:
7.1.2.18.2	This is indeed the Anushtubha.
7.1.2.18.3	Speech is the Anushtubh.
7.1.2.18.4	That which is this pair of forms of speech, divine and human, loud and soft, those are these two.
7.1.2.19.1	These three Anushtubh verses are indeed the Garhapatya.
7.1.2.19.2	That which they accomplish here with these three Anushtubhs, then indeed all the worlds are here.
7.1.2.19.3	Then they carry the Āhavanīya fire to the other end of the thirty-two-syllable Anushtubh verse.
7.1.2.19.4	That Āhavanīya is heaven, that is the head.
7.1.2.19.5	Then another remains here.
7.1.2.19.6	That is the Garhapatya.
7.1.2.19.7	That is stability.
7.1.2.19.8	That is this world.
7.1.2.20.1	Now, those two verses are the two (verses) between the Āhavanīya and the Garhapatya. That is the atmosphere. That is the Self.
7.1.2.20.2	That they are two, therefore this is the most subtle (verse) between the Āhavaniya and the Garhapati.
7.1.2.20.3	Therefore, of these worlds, the atmosphere is the most subtle.
7.1.2.21.1	This is the Anushtubh verse divided into three parts.
7.1.2.21.2	This Agni, having become Prāṇa, moves along with it.
7.1.2.21.3	The Agni in the Āhavanīya is Prāṇa, that is the Sun.
7.1.2.21.4	The Agni that is in the Agnidhriya is Vyāna, that is this Wind.
7.1.2.21.5	The wind that blows here and the fire in the Gārhapatya, that is the Udanas, and that is the fire in this world.
7.1.2.21.6	Thus indeed, he makes all speech, all breath, and all self pure.
7.1.2.22.1	This is indeed the Brihatī.
7.1.2.22.2	Those who are two and thirty,
7.1.2.22.3	that is indeed thirty-two.
7.1.2.22.4	Now these two verses.
7.1.2.22.5	And that is thirty-four.
7.1.2.22.6	Agni himself is thirty-five.
7.1.2.22.7	The verse does not go beyond a syllable, not from two.
7.1.2.22.8	It is a two-syllabled verse.
7.1.2.22.9	That is thirty-six.
7.1.2.22.10	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
7.1.2.22.11	He indeed attains the Brihatī when he builds up.
7.1.2.22.12	Just as the semen is deposited in the womb, so is the child born.
7.1.2.22.13	In that he makes this Brihatī here, therefore this one, having accumulated, approaches the Brihatī.
7.1.2.23.1	They say, "This world is the Garhapatya, the sky is the Dhishnya, heaven is the Ahavaniya. The world of the sky is not separated from this world. Then why does one perform the Garhapatyaga and then the Ahavaniya and then the Dhishnyas?"
7.1.2.23.2	Indeed, these two worlds were together in the beginning.
7.1.2.23.3	The space between them became the atmosphere.
7.1.2.23.4	It was called 'Eeksam' (the seen).
7.1.2.23.5	Then it became 'Purantaram' (within the city).
7.1.2.23.6	Therefore, it is called 'Antariksha' (atmosphere).
7.1.2.23.7	When one builds the Garhapatya and then the Ahavaniya, it is because these two worlds were created first.
7.1.2.23.8	Then having returned, he pours down the Dhishnya-grasses, for the sake of continuity of the rite.
7.1.2.23.9	And also the middle is sanctified when the two ends are being sanctified.
7.2.1.1.1	Now then they carry the Nirrti-grasses.
7.2.1.1.2	The gods, having piled up the Garhapatya, ascended it.
7.2.1.1.3	This world is the Garhapaty.
7.2.1.1.4	Having sanctified this world, they ascended it.
7.2.1.1.5	They saw that darkness which is not seen.
7.2.1.2.1	They said, "Let us know how we can remove this darkness and sin."
7.2.1.2.2	They said, “Let us think.”
7.2.1.2.3	They said, indeed, “Let us desire to think.”
7.2.1.2.4	They desired, “Let us know how to remove this darkness and evil.”
7.2.1.4.2	This is the sin and evil that has been removed by the gods.
7.2.1.4.3	"What he does, he does saying, "What the gods did, I do."
7.2.1.4.4	And what sin and evil there is, he removes it with these (verses).
7.2.1.4.5	And because he removes sin and evil with these (verses), therefore they are called Nirrti.
7.2.1.5.1	The reason why they carry these (bricks) belonging to the Nirrti is this.
7.2.1.5.2	When Prajapati was scattered, the gods collected him together, and deposited his seed in the form of semen in the womb of the cauldron.
7.2.1.5.3	The cauldron is the womb.
7.2.1.5.4	Therefore they established him in the year, in this world.
7.2.1.5.5	This world is the Gārhapatya.
7.2.1.5.6	In it they generated him.
7.2.1.5.7	Whatever sin, whatever phlegm, whatever membrane, whatever placenta there was, they destroyed it with these.
7.2.1.5.8	And because they destroyed sin and misfortune with these, therefore these are the Nirrti deities.
7.2.1.6.1	In the same way the sacrificer pours his own self in the form of semen into the womb of the pot.
7.2.1.6.2	The pot is the womb.
7.2.1.6.3	Therefore, he performs this consecration in the course of a year. He consecrates him to this world.
7.2.1.6.4	This world is the Gārhapatya.
7.2.1.6.5	He generates him in that.
7.2.1.6.6	He removes his sin, phlegm, the covering, and the placenta with these (verses).
7.2.1.6.7	Since he removes evil, misfortune, by means of these, therefore they are called Nirrti.
7.2.1.7.1	They are of the size of a foot.
7.2.1.7.2	He makes evil, misfortune, inferior.
7.2.1.7.3	They are without characteristics.
7.2.1.7.4	What does not exist is without characteristics.
7.2.1.7.5	He makes the evil, misfortune, non-existent.
7.2.1.7.6	They become cooked with chaff.
7.2.1.7.7	The chaff belongs to the south.
7.2.1.7.8	He performs that southern rite with the southern (kindling wood).
7.2.1.7.9	They are black.
7.2.1.7.10	For that was black, darkness.
7.2.1.7.11	And black is indeed Nirriti.
7.2.1.8.1	With them they go to that direction.
7.2.1.8.2	This is the southern direction.
7.2.1.8.3	He places Nirriti in the south-west direction.
7.2.1.8.4	He should place it where there is a pit or a hole made by himself or by an enemy.
7.2.1.8.5	Where her plants wither or do not grow, Nirriti takes hold of it.
7.2.1.8.6	He places Nirriti on the south-west part of the earth.
7.2.1.8.7	Having placed them in the opposite direction, he places them in the directions.
7.2.1.9.1	"He desires one who does not offer sacrifices and does not worship."
7.2.1.9.2	One who does not offer sacrifice and does not worship, him Nirriti (the goddess of death) approaches.
7.2.1.9.3	"He says, "Of the thief," and "Of the robber."
7.2.1.9.4	"He says "Of the thief" and "Of a robber."
7.2.1.9.5	"Then, as a thief, having fled, so flee."
7.2.1.9.6	"May she go to another than us."
7.2.1.9.7	"This means, 'May she go to one who does not know the truth.'"
7.2.1.9.8	"Salutations to thee, O goddess, Nirriti, be."
7.2.1.9.9	He strikes her with salutations.
7.2.1.10.1	"Salutations unto thee, O Nirriti, of sharp lustre."
7.2.1.10.2	Nirriti is of sharp lustre.
7.2.1.10.3	She is worshipped by this (verse).
7.2.1.10.4	"This is the bond of iron, the crooked one."
7.2.1.10.5	Nirriti binds him with the bond of iron with which she binds him.
7.2.1.10.6	"Thou art united with Yama and Yamya."
7.2.1.10.7	Yama is Agni, Yamya is this (earth).
7.2.1.10.8	By these two this whole (universe) is held.
7.2.1.10.9	"You know these two."
7.2.1.10.10	"You raise him up in the highest heaven."
7.2.1.10.11	The heaven is the sky.
7.2.1.10.12	"It means, 'You raise the sacrificer up in the heaven.'"
7.2.1.11.1	"To the one who has your terrible (power), I offer."
7.2.1.11.2	Terrible is Nirriti.
7.2.1.11.3	He offers to her what is hers when he performs a rite dedicated to her.
7.2.1.11.4	For the release of these bonds.
7.2.1.11.5	By which bonds one is bound.
7.2.1.11.6	You whom people call the earth.
7.2.1.11.7	This is the earth.
7.2.1.11.8	He who is, is in her.
7.2.1.11.9	I announce to you Nirriti, from all sides.
7.2.1.11.10	I announce Nirriti to you from all sides. This is what it means.
7.2.1.11.11	This is Nirriti.
7.2.1.12.5	The foundation is the laying down.
7.2.1.12.6	"So that he does not establish sin."
7.2.1.12.7	He does not recite the Sūdadoha.
7.2.1.12.8	Sūdadoha is the breath.
7.2.1.12.9	"So as not to join sin with the breath."
7.2.1.13.1	Some place them on the other side of the fire.
7.2.1.13.2	Sin is Nirriti.
7.2.1.13.3	"So one does not follow sin, Nirriti."
7.2.1.13.4	One should not do so.
7.2.1.13.5	He should place it facing away.
7.2.1.13.6	He thus drives away evil, misfortune, facing away.
7.2.1.14.1	One places three bricks.
7.2.1.14.2	Agni is threefold.
7.2.1.14.3	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, by so much he thus drives away evil and misfortune.
7.2.1.15.1	Then he places the stool, the noose, the golden noose, and the two Indras in the eastern half.
7.2.1.15.2	Nirriti is the noose.
7.2.1.15.3	One is released from the noose of Nirriti.
7.2.1.15.4	"The noose that the goddess Nirriti bound around your neck, I loosen it."
7.2.1.15.5	One who does not know this is not released.
7.2.1.15.6	"I loosen it from the middle of your life."
7.2.1.15.7	Agni is life.
7.2.1.15.8	This is its middle.
7.2.1.15.9	And the Garhapatya is made of wood, while the Ahavaniya is not.
7.2.1.15.10	Therefore, if a young man builds a fire, or if an old man, it is not from the middle of his life.
7.2.1.15.11	He says this.
7.2.1.15.12	Food is the father.
7.2.1.15.13	Then he says, "Take this food that has been released." This is what he says.
7.2.1.15.14	With Tristubh verses.
7.2.1.15.15	The Tristubh is the thunderbolt.
7.2.1.15.16	With the thunderbolt he indeed strikes away evil, ill-luck.
7.2.1.16.1	There are three bricks, a stool, a noose, a golden noose, two Indras.
7.2.1.16.2	That makes eight.
7.2.1.16.3	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
7.2.1.16.4	Agni is Gayatri.
7.2.1.16.5	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, by so much he strikes away evil, misfortune.
7.2.1.17.1	Then he carries it away without touching water.
7.2.1.17.2	Water is the thunderbolt.
7.2.1.17.3	He thus removes evil, misfortune, by means of the thunderbolt.
7.2.1.17.4	They rise up with the formula, "Salutations to Bhuti, who has done this."
7.2.1.17.5	The gods first performed the rite for Bhuti.
7.2.1.17.6	They paid homage to her.
7.2.1.17.7	One performs this rite for Bhuti.
7.2.1.17.8	She pays homage to her.
7.2.1.17.9	They come without waiting.
7.2.1.17.10	They leave the evil, the Niriti, behind without waiting.
7.2.1.18.1	Having returned, he attends Agni.
7.2.1.18.2	He does this in an irregular manner, for when he goes to this direction in the Agni-sāmitī, he does it in an irregular manner.
7.2.1.18.3	He appeases him for non-injury.
7.2.1.19.1	He who approaches it.
7.2.1.19.2	This world is the Gārhapatya.
7.2.1.19.3	The Gārhapaty is indeed a support.
7.2.1.19.4	This is indeed a support,
7.2.1.19.5	and when one goes in this direction, it is as if one goes on a path.
7.2.1.19.6	When one approaches it, one returns to this support.
7.2.1.19.7	One stands on this support.
7.2.1.20.1	The dwelling place, the meeting place of the Vasus.
7.2.1.20.2	This world is indeed the dwelling place, the place of meeting of the Vasus
7.2.1.20.3	He sees all forms with the Shachis.
7.2.1.20.4	He sees all the forms with the Shachīs, so it is said.
7.2.1.20.5	Like a god, Savitar, Indra, the upholder of truth, did not stand in the battle of the paths.
7.2.1.20.6	The binding is as in the Yajus.
7.2.2.1.1	Then he performs the Pravargya rite.
7.2.2.1.2	He releases speech with the Havishkrit (mantra).
7.2.2.1.3	Having released speech, he carries the Stambayajus.
7.2.2.1.4	Having carried the Stambayjcus, having encircled with the eastern enclosing sticks, having written (the names of the deities), he says, "Take three times."
7.2.2.1.5	The Agnidhra takes it three times.
7.2.2.2.1	Having returned, he proceeds with the Pravargya.
7.2.2.2.2	Having proceeded with the Pravargva, he yokes the chariot.
7.2.2.4.4	They yoke the ploughs and spread out the yokes separately.
7.2.2.4.5	"The wise ones, for the sake of the gods, make the sacrifice."
7.2.2.4.6	The sacrifice is indeed the good.
7.2.2.4.7	"The good ones, for the gods, make a sacrifice." This is what it means.
7.2.2.5.1	"Yoke the ploughs and make the yokes."
7.2.2.5.2	They do yoke the ploughs.
7.2.2.5.3	They make the yokes.
7.2.2.5.4	"Sow the seed in the prepared field."
7.2.2.5.5	This is the seed-bed for the seed, when it is sown in the furrow.
7.2.2.5.6	Just as if one were to sow seed in a place not fit for it, so is it when one sows in a place not tilled.
7.2.2.5.7	"The song and the praise have become one,"
7.2.2.5.8	Song is speech,
7.2.2.5.9	Praise is food.
7.2.2.5.10	"May the giver of food come here,"
7.2.2.5.11	When the food is cooked, they serve it with spoons.
7.2.2.5.12	He yokes it with two (verses), the Gāyatrī and the Tristubh.
7.2.2.5.13	Its relation has been explained.
7.2.2.6.1	He first yokes the right one, then the left one.
7.2.2.6.2	Thus in the case of the gods; otherwise in the case of men.
7.2.2.6.3	It becomes six-fold, twelve-fold, or twenty-four-fold.
7.2.2.6.4	The year is indeed the accomplishment.
7.2.2.7.1	Then he ploughs it.
7.2.2.7.2	Agriculture is indeed food.
7.2.2.7.3	The gods, while preparing this (earth), placed food in front of it.
7.2.2.7.4	In the same way, he, while preparing this, places food in front of this.
7.2.2.8.1	He ploughs himself alone, not the wings and tail.
7.2.2.9.2	May the ploughmen plough the fields, may the merchants drive the carts.
7.2.2.9.3	"May the merchants drive the merchants' carts."
7.2.2.9.4	"What is prosperous is 'shunam.'
7.2.2.9.5	He prospers her indeed."
7.2.2.10.1	"Then with the right half (of the verse) he binds the southern direction with ghee and honey: 'May the southern direction be bound with ghee and honey.'
7.2.2.10.2	As the text, so the meaning."
7.2.2.10.3	The Maruts, approved by all the gods, have said this.
7.2.2.10.4	The gods and the Maruts are the lords of the year.
7.2.2.10.5	"She who is full of strength, swelling with milk, "
7.2.2.10.6	Milk is indeed sap.
7.2.2.10.7	"She who is full with sap, with food, swelling, " is what is meant.
7.2.2.10.8	"Protect us with cold, with milk, " is what it means.
7.2.2.10.9	"O Sita, turn to us with your juice." This is what it means.
7.2.2.11.1	And with the second half, "The plow, the eastern one, the plow, the western one."
7.2.2.11.2	"The plow, the one with wealth." This is what is meant.
7.2.2.11.3	"The plow with good furrows, the one with Soma."
7.2.2.11.4	Soma is food.
7.2.2.11.5	He pours out the cow, the sheep, the goat, the mare, the female donkey, the cart, the vehicle.
7.2.2.11.6	He offers all this with the verse, "May the wind blow for us."
7.2.2.12.1	Then with the first half, "Do thou milk the cow for Mitra, Varuna, Indra, the Asvins, and Pusan, for offspring and plants."
7.2.2.12.2	Agriculture is dedicated to all gods.
7.2.2.12.3	"Do thou milk all desires for these deities."
7.2.2.12.4	"In the beginning, he ploughs; then, he ploughs." Then, he ploughs. Then, he plough
7.2.2.12.5	It is turned to the right.
7.2.2.12.6	It is divine.
7.2.2.13.1	He ploughs with four furrows according to the Yajus.
7.2.2.13.2	Whatever food there is in the four directions, he places it here.
7.2.2.13.3	It is done according to the Yajur.
7.2.2.13.4	Indeed, that is the Yajur, and these directions are indeed the Yajur.
7.2.2.14.1	Then he ploughs the soil.
7.2.2.14.2	He puts in it the food that is in the year.
7.2.2.14.3	Silently.
7.2.2.14.4	What is silent is undefined.
7.2.2.14.5	All is undefined.
7.2.2.14.6	He puts all food in it.
7.2.2.14.7	He ploughs first, then, then, then.
7.2.2.14.8	That is the right-hand direction.
7.2.2.14.9	That is the divine direction.
7.2.2.15.1	He ploughs three furrows, three furrows.
7.2.2.15.2	Agni is threefold.
7.2.2.15.3	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, so much he puts food in him.
7.2.2.16.1	He ploughes twelve furrows silently.
7.2.2.16.2	Twelve months are a year.
7.2.2.16.3	The year is Agni.
7.2.2.16.4	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, so much food he puts in him.
7.2.2.17.1	They become sixteen altogether.
7.2.2.17.2	Prajapati is sixteen-fold.
7.2.2.17.3	Prajapatih is Agni.
7.2.2.17.4	He puts food in him according to his own measure.
7.2.2.17.5	Whatever food is according to one's own measure, that sustains one and does not harm.
7.2.2.19.1	He ploughs with four Sitas (i.e. furrows) according to the Yajus.
7.2.2.19.2	He puts these four well-known breaths in the head.
7.2.2.19.3	It is according to the Yajur.
7.2.2.19.4	Indeed, that is the Yajur, and that is the head, these breaths.
7.2.2.20.1	He ploughs himself.
7.2.2.20.2	He places in it the very same breaths that are within the self.
7.2.2.20.3	Silently.
7.2.2.20.4	For who knows how many breaths there are within the self?
7.2.2.21.1	Then he releases them, having taken them, for the purpose for which he yokes them.
7.2.2.21.2	"Release yourselves, O blameless ones!"
7.2.2.21.3	They are indeed blameless in the divine world.
7.2.2.21.4	"Going to the gods."
7.2.2.21.5	For it is by these that one performs the rite.
7.2.2.21.6	"We have gone to the other side of darkness."
7.2.2.21.7	Darkness is indeed hunger.
7.2.2.21.8	"We went to the other side for hunger."
7.2.2.21.9	"Light is the waters."
7.2.2.21.10	He who attains the gods and the sacrifice attains light.
7.2.2.21.11	Then he releases them towards the north and east.
7.2.2.21.12	The significance of this has been explained.
7.2.2.21.13	He gives them to the Adhvaryu.
7.2.2.21.14	For he makes them with them.
7.2.2.21.15	But he should give them at the time of the Dakṣiṇās.
7.2.3.1.1	Then he places a bunch of Darbha grass.
7.2.3.1.2	The gods placed the form of the plants here.
7.2.3.1.3	In the same way, the sacrificer places the plants.
7.2.3.2.1	When he places a bunch (of Darbha grass),
7.2.3.2.2	this is born, this is produced.
7.2.3.2.3	He is born from all food.
7.2.3.2.4	Both of these are food, namely, darbha grass.
7.2.3.2.5	For these are both water and plants.
7.2.3.2.6	The waters that were frightened by Vritra, and which were scattered on the bow, became darbha grass. They were scattered on the sky.
7.2.3.2.7	Because they were scattered on the heaven, they are darbha grass.
7.2.3.2.8	These are the pure, sacred waters that have flowed over the demons, namely the darbha grass.
7.2.3.2.9	And because they are darbha grass, they are herbs.
7.2.3.2.10	He thus pleases him with both kinds of food.
7.2.3.3.1	The Sītasamara.
7.2.3.3.2	The Sitasamara is speech.
7.2.3.3.3	The Sītās are the vital airs.
7.2.3.3.4	This is their agreement.
7.2.3.3.5	Food is deposited in speech from the vital airs.
7.2.3.3.6	In the middle, in the middle, he places this food.
7.2.3.3.7	Silently.
7.2.3.3.8	That which is silent is undefined.
7.2.3.3.9	All is undefined.
7.2.3.3.10	With all he places this food in it.
7.2.3.4.1	Then he offers it.
7.2.3.4.2	This is born when it is piled up.
7.2.3.4.3	It is born for all food.
7.2.3.4.4	This is the essence of all this, namely, ghee, of water and of plants.
7.2.3.4.5	This is the essence of plants.
7.2.3.4.6	He thus delights him with the essence of all that is here.
7.2.3.4.7	As great as the essence is, so great is the Self.
7.2.3.4.8	He thus pleases him with the essence.
7.2.3.4.9	As great is the essence, so great is this Self.
7.2.3.4.10	He pleases him with all this.
7.2.3.4.11	with five handfuls.
7.2.3.4.12	The fire has five layers.
7.2.3.4.13	The year has five seasons.
7.2.3.4.14	The year is Agni.
7.2.3.4.15	He thus satisfies him with as much food as Agni is and as much as his measure is.
7.2.3.5.1	And when he offers to him, 
7.2.3.5.2	This is the place where the Rishis, the vital airs, first united Agni. They made this his portion in front.
7.2.3.5.3	Therefore, portions are in front.
7.2.3.5.4	When he offers the oblation, he pleases those vital airs, the Rishis who made this portion in front, with ghee taken five times.
7.2.3.5.5	His relation has been stated.
7.2.3.6.1	He offers it with the formula, "To him who is Agni, to him who is Soma, to him who has become Indra, to him who will be Pūṣan, to him who shall be Varuna, I offer this oblation."
7.2.3.6.2	Those forms which he is going to deposit in this Agni, those Stotras, those Stomas, those Prsthas, those metres, to them he makes this portion in front.
7.2.3.6.3	He thus pleases them.
7.2.3.6.4	With ghee taken five times.
7.2.3.6.5	His relation has been told.
7.2.3.7.1	He offers it to him as a special offering.
7.2.3.7.2	The gods were afraid, saying, "This rite is long.
7.2.3.7.3	If the Rakshas and the evil spirits do not kill him here."
7.2.3.7.4	They saw this rite's completion before it.
7.2.3.7.5	They established everything here, they fixed it here.
7.2.3.7.6	and in the same way he establishes him here in all this, and builds him here.
7.2.3.8.1	"The verse, "The year is with us," is the building (of the altar).
7.2.3.8.2	" "The verse, "With the Ajas," is the filling (of the altar)."
7.2.3.8.3	"The verse "The dawn is with us, " is the building ( of the altar).
7.2.3.8.4	" "The verse, 'With the red ones,' is the filling ( of the altar)."
7.2.3.8.5	The verse, "Together with the Ashvins," is the Building (of the altar)
7.2.3.8.6	" "The verses, "With the Dandas," is the Filling (of the altar ).
7.2.3.8.7	" "The verses, 'The sun is with us,' is the Building ( of the altar ).
7.2.3.8.8	"Etasena" is the ashes.
7.2.3.8.9	"Sajuvaishvanara" is the kindling wood.
7.2.3.8.10	"Idaya" is the ashes again.
7.2.3.8.11	"Ghritena" is the kind ling wood.
7.2.3.8.12	"Sva" is the ashes once more.
7.2.3.8.13	"He" is the kind ing wood.
7.2.3.9.1	These are the thirteen Vyahrtis.
7.2.3.9.2	The year has thirteen months.
7.2.3.9.3	There are thirteen kinds of Agni's ashes.
7.2.3.9.4	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, so much he thus builds him.
7.2.3.9.5	He offers with ghee.
7.2.3.9.6	This is Agni, namely ghee.
7.2.3.9.7	He thus builds Agni.
7.2.3.9.8	With fivefold (ghee).
7.2.3.9.9	Agni is fivefold.
7.2.3.9.10	The year has five seasons.
7.2.3.9.11	The year is Agni.
7.2.3.9.12	Whatever is the extent of Agni, whatever is his measure, he builds him to that extent.
7.2.3.9.13	He offers while holding it upwards.
7.2.3.9.14	He builds Agni upwards with the building materials.
7.2.4.1.1	Then he carries the water-bowls.
7.2.4.1.2	The gods said this: "Let us reflect."
7.2.4.1.3	They said, "We desire to build."
7.2.4.1.4	And they, reflecting, saw the rain as the oblation.
7.2.4.1.5	They placed it in this (fire).
7.2.4.1.6	In the same way he places it in this (oblation).
7.2.4.2.1	The cups are of water.
7.2.4.2.2	Water is rain.
7.2.4.2.3	He thus places rain in this (oblution).
7.2.4.2.4	With a cup of Udumbara wood.
7.2.4.2.5	Its significance is explained.
7.2.4.2.6	With four corners.
7.2.4.2.7	There are four directions.
7.2.4.2.8	He thus places rain from all directions in it.
7.2.4.3.1	He pours three pitchers of water.
7.2.4.3.2	Agni is threefold.
7.2.4.3.3	He thus puts rain in it to the extent of Agni's size and measure.
7.2.4.4.1	He pours twelve pitchers of water in the field.
7.2.4.4.2	Twelve months are a year.
7.2.4.4.3	The year is Agni.
7.2.4.4.4	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with that much he places rain in him.
7.2.4.5.1	He places it in the ploughed (land).
7.2.4.5.2	Therefore it rains on the ploughed (field).
7.2.4.5.3	If he were to place it only in the ploughed field, it would rain on the ploughed field and not on the unploughed.
7.2.4.5.4	Now if he were to pour it out only on the unploughed (land), he would cause rain only on the un-ploughed (land).
7.2.4.5.5	He pours it out on both the ploughed and the unploughed.
7.2.4.5.6	Therefore he causes rain on both the ploughed and the unploughed (land).
7.2.4.6.1	Three times he pours it out on the ploughed and unploughed (lands).
7.2.4.6.2	Agni is threefold.
7.2.4.6.3	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, so much rain he places in him.
7.2.4.7.1	When he carries the water-bowls,
7.2.4.7.2	the gods, when they were about to restore him, placed water in front of him.
7.2.4.7.3	In the same way this one, when he is about to restore him places water in front of it.
7.2.4.8.1	He carries three water-bowls.
7.2.4.8.2	Agni is threefold.
7.2.4.8.3	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, so much water he puts in him.
7.2.4.9.1	He puts twelve water-cups in the ploughed (field).
7.2.4.9.2	Twelve months are a year.
7.2.4.9.3	The year is Agni.
7.2.4.9.4	As much as Agni is as much as is its measure, so much he puts in him water.
7.2.4.10.1	He puts them in the ploughed field.
7.2.4.10.2-6	He puts water in the vital airs. If he were to put it in the ploughed (field) only, then water would be in the vital airs and not in the other body. If he puts it in the unploughed (field) alone, then water would only be in the body and not in the vital airs.
7.2.4.11.1	He places three (bricks) in the ploughed and unploughed (parts of the altar).
7.2.4.11.2	Agni is threefold.
7.2.4.11.3	He places water in it as much as Agni is and as much as is his measure.
7.2.4.12.1	He places fifteen water-cups.
7.2.4.12.2	The thunderbolt is fifteenfold.
7.2.4.12.3	By this very fifteenfold thunderbolt he removes all evil.
7.2.4.13.1	Then he sows all the herbs.
7.2.4.13.2	The gods said, "Let us think."
7.2.4.13.3	They said, "Let's think about the altar."
7.2.4.13.4	Thinking, they saw food as the altar.
7.2.4.13.5	They placed it in him.
7.2.4.13.6	In the same way, he places this in him.
7.2.4.14.1	It is all herbs.
7.2.4.14.2	All that is food is all herbs. He places all that in it.
7.2.4.14.3	One should take out one of them.
7.2.4.14.4	One should not eat it as long as one lives.
7.2.4.14.5	With a fig-wood bowl.
7.2.4.14.6	Its relation is stated.
7.2.4.14.7	With four corners.
7.2.4.14.8	There are four directions.
7.2.4.14.9	He thus places food from all directions in it.
7.2.4.14.10	He sows with Anushtubh verses.
7.2.4.14.11	Anushtubh is speech.
7.2.4.14.12	Food is obtained from speech.
7.2.4.15.1	He sows three times with three verses.
7.2.4.15.2	Agni is threefold.
7.2.4.15.3	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, so much of food he puts in him.
7.2.4.16.1	He sows on the ploughed field with twelve verses.
7.2.4.16.2	Twelve months are a year.
7.2.4.16.3	The year is Agni.
7.2.4.16.4	As much as Agni is as much as is its measure, so much food he puts in it.
7.2.4.17.1	He sows in the ploughed field.
7.2.4.17.2	Therefore, food is cooked in the cultivated (land).
7.2.4.17.3	If he were to sow only in the cultivated (field), food would be cooked only in the cultivated field and not in the uncultivated (field).
7.2.4.17.4	Or if he were to sow in the uncultivaed (field) only, food would be cooked in the uncultivted (field) and not in the cultivated (one).
7.2.4.17.5	He sows in both the cultivated and uncultivated (fields).
7.2.4.17.6	Therefore, food is cooked both in the cultivated and uncultvated (fields).
7.2.4.18.1	He sows in the three furrows, both ploughed and unploughed.
7.2.4.18.2	Agni is threefold.
7.2.4.18.3	He puts this much of food in him as Agni is and as is his measure.
7.2.4.19.1	In that he sows all herbs,
7.2.4.19.2	the gods, when they were going to restore him, first healed him with all herbs.
7.2.4.19.3	and in the same way he now heals him with all the medicine, beginning from the front.
7.2.4.20.1	All the medicine is used.
7.2.4.20.2	All this is medicine, namely, all the medicine.
7.2.4.20.3	He heals him with all this medicine.
7.2.4.21.1	He offers with three verses each.
7.2.4.21.2	Agni is threefold.
7.2.4.23.2	He heals the vital airs.
7.2.4.23.3	If he were to sow only in the ploughed (field), he would heal the vital airs and not the other self.
7.2.4.23.4	If he would sow only in the unploughed (field), then he would heal the self and not the vital airs. 
7.2.4.23.5	When he sows in both the ploughed and unploughed (fields), then he heals both the vital airs and the self.
7.2.4.24.1	He sows in three furrows, both ploughed and unploughed.
7.2.4.24.2	Agni is threefold.
7.2.4.24.3	He heals him with as much as Agni is and as much as his measure is.
7.2.4.25.1	He carries five fifteen-fold water-cups.
7.2.4.25.2	He sows with fifteen verses.
7.2.4.25.3	That makes thirty.
7.2.4.25.4	The Viraj has thirty syllables.
7.2.4.25.5	Viraj has made the entire food.
7.2.4.25.6	He places all this entire food in it.
7.2.4.26.1	"The plants that were born first, for three years before the gods."
7.2.4.26.2	The gods are the seasons.
7.2.4.26.3	They are born three times before them: in spring, in the rainy season, and in autumn.
7.2.4.26.4	"I am the tawny-colored one among the tawny-colored ones."
7.2.4.26.5	Soma is the tawny one.
7.2.4.26.6	The plants are Soma-like.
7.2.4.26.7	Man is the plant.
7.2.4.26.8	"A hundred abodes."
7.2.4.26.9	"What is here, a hundred years, a hundred worths, a hundred veers, these are his hundred abodes." "
7.2.4.26.10	"And seven."
7.2.4.26.11	He says these are the seven heads, the vital airs.
7.2.4.27.1	"A thousand and a hundred abodes of yours, O Amba."
7.2.4.27.2	These are the hundred and thousandfold diseases.
7.2.4.27.3	"You all, the hundred-fold, have made this medicine for me."
7.2.4.27.4	"This is the one who is being healed by the physicians."
7.2.4.28.1	These are the single explanations.
7.2.4.28.2	One should heal him just as one would heal him. One should protect him.
7.2.4.28.3	They are Anushtubh verses.
7.2.4.28.4	Speech is Anushtubh.
7.2.4.28.5	Speech is the remedy for all.
7.2.4.28.6	He heals him with the remedy of all.
7.2.4.29.1	Now, then, of those that are prescribed and those that are not prescribed.
7.2.4.29.2	He yokes two oxen with a formula, the others silently.
7.2.4.29.3	He ploughs four furrows with a formula, others silently.
7.2.4.29.4	Silently he places the darbha-bunch.
7.2.4.29.5	He offers with a formula.
7.2.4.29.6	He carries the cups of water silently.
7.2.4.29.7	He offers with a formula.
7.2.4.30.1	This Agni is Prajapati.
7.2.4.30.2	Prajapati is both the known and the unknown, the limited and the unlimited.
7.2.4.30.3	When he does it with a formula, he makes up for him what is known and limited.
7.2.4.30.4	Now when he does it silently, then whatever form of his is not mentioned, unlimited, that he makes it by that.
7.2.4.30.5	He indeed makes this entire, complete Prajapati, he who knowing thus does thus.
7.2.4.30.6	The external forms are mentioned, the internal ones are not mentioned.
7.2.4.30.7	This Agni is indeed an animal.
7.2.4.30.8	Therefore the external forms of the animal are described, the internal ones are not described.
7.3.1.1.1	The Garhapatya is the mind, the Ahavaniya is the non-mind.
7.3.1.1.2	Then he buys the king.
7.3.1.1.3	This world is the Garhapatya, heaven is the Ahavaniya.
7.3.1.1.4	Now this wind that blows, that is Soma. He places these two worlds between them.
7.3.1.1.5	Therefore this wind blows between these two worlds.
7.3.1.2.1	When the Garhapatya is spread out and the Ahavaniya is not spread out, then he buys the Soma.
7.3.1.2.2	The Self is Agni.
7.3.1.2.3	The breath is Soma.
7.3.1.2.4	He places the Self in the middle of that Prāṇa.
7.3.1.2.5	Therefore this Self is in the middle of Prāṇa. .
7.3.1.3.1	When the Garhapatya is kindled and the Āhavanīya is not kindled, then he buys the king.
7.3.1.3.2	The Self is Agni.
7.3.1.3.3	The juice is Soma.
7.3.1.3.4	He joins the Self with the juice.
7.3.1.3.5	Therefore this self is joined with the juice only within.
7.3.1.4.1	Having bought the king, he then offers the sacrificial food to him as a guest.
7.3.1.4.2	He releases speech at the end of the sacrificial food.
7.3.1.4.3	He thus separates the Adhvara rite and the Agni rite, for the uniformity of the rite, saying, "This rite is uniform."
7.3.1.5.1	In that he separates,
7.3.1.5.2	Agni is the Self,
7.3.1.5.3	the Adhvara is the breath,
7.3.1.5.4	He places the Self in the middle of that Prāṇa.
7.3.1.5.5	Therefore this Self is in the middle of the Prāṇa. .
7.3.1.6.1	When he arranges (the bricks) in a crosswise manner,
7.3.1.6.2	the Self is Agni,
7.3.1.6.3	the Adhvara is the Rasa.
7.3.1.6.4	He joins the Self with the Rasa.
7.3.1.6.5	Therefore this self is joined with the Rasa in the middle.
7.3.1.6.6	Then he comes to half of the Ahavaniya.
7.3.1.7.1	Then they take it up with the Palasha branch at both places, saying, "We take it up at both places."
7.3.1.7.2	One should not do so.
7.3.1.7.3	One is indeed settled by the Garhapatya.
7.3.1.7.4	One rises up by the Ahavaniya.
7.3.1.7.5	Therefore one should not do so thus.
7.3.1.8.1	Then one puts the oṣadhis on the Garhapaty alone, not on the Ahavaniya;
7.3.1.8.2	This world is the Garhapatyam;
7.3.1.9.7	It is indeed in both places that it is offered, therefore, it is offered from the semen.
7.3.1.10.1	He offers them with two different mantras.
7.3.1.10.2	The Garhapatya is the world of men.
7.3.1.10.3	The Ahavanīya is the world gods.
7.3.1.10.4	The divine and the human are indeed different.
7.3.1.10.5	He offers on the Ahavanīya with a long mantra and on the Garhapatya with a short mantra.
7.3.1.10.6	The life of gods is long.
7.3.1.10.7	The human life span is decreasing.
7.3.1.10.8	He pours sand on the Garhapatya from the eastern side.
7.3.1.10.9	Sand is semen. From this semen, the offspring are born.
7.3.1.11.1	They say, "The womb is the enclosing sticks, the semen is the sand. And the enclosing sticks are before the Garhapatya, and he pours the sand on the Garhapaty. How does his semen become poured on and enclosed?"
7.3.1.11.2	The womb is the sand.
7.3.1.11.3	Now, when he pours the seeds of the Uṣa plant, then his semen is enclosed by this womb.
7.3.1.11.4	Then he recites over the fire-wood placed around the fire.
7.3.1.11.5	Its relation has been explained.
7.3.1.11.6	Then he pours sand.
7.3.1.11.7	Sand is semen.
7.3.1.11.8	This is the womb of these two, the semen is deposited in it and is held.
7.3.1.12.1	Then he touches the Ahavaniya with the Apānavati verses, not the Garhapatya.
7.3.1.12.2	This world is the Garhapaty.
7.3.1.12.3	The heaven is the Ahavaniya.
7.3.1.12.4	The sacrificer is born in this world, he should be born in the heaven.
7.3.1.12.5	Now, when he touches the Ahavaniya with the two Apānavati verses, but not the Garhapatya, then he generates him in the world of heaven.
7.3.1.13.1	Then he lays down the Lokeshta bricks.
7.3.1.13.2	These indeed are the worlds, this is Agni.
7.3.1.13.3	The Lokeshta bricks are the directions.
7.3.1.13.4	He places the directions in these worlds.
7.3.1.13.5	Therefore these directions are here in these worlds.
7.3.1.14.1	He brings in the fire from outside.
7.3.1.14.2	The directions which are in these worlds are obtained by him.
7.3.1.14.3	And those directions which are beyond these worlds, he places them in this (fire).
7.3.1.15.1	Outside the altar.
7.3.1.15.2	This is the altar.
7.3.1.15.3	The directions, which are in this (world), are obtained by him;
7.3.1.15.4	And those directions, which are beyond this (world), he places them in it.
7.3.1.16.1	The reason why he lays down the bricks of the people is this.
7.3.1.16.2	When Prajapati was scattered, his sap flowed into all directions.
7.3.1.16.3	Where the gods collected him, there they put that sap into him with these bricks of the people.
7.3.1.16.4	In the same way he puts it into him here.
7.3.1.17.1	He brings the fire from outside.
7.3.1.17.2	The essence of this world is obtained by him.
7.3.1.17.3	And that essence which has passed beyond these worlds, he places it in this (world).
7.3.1.18.1	Outside the altar.
7.3.1.18.2	This (earth) is the altar.
7.3.1.18.3	The essence of this (earth) is obtained by him who is on it.
7.3.1.18.4	And that which has passed beyond this (earth), he places it in it.
7.3.1.19.1	He takes it with the wooden sword.
7.3.1.19.2	The wooden sword is indeed a thunderbolt.
7.3.1.19.3	The thunderbolt is indeed energy.
7.3.1.19.4	This is the means of obtaining.
7.3.1.19.5	One obtains the means of obtaining by means of energy.
7.3.1.20.1	He takes it from the front, saying, "May the generator of the earth not injure me."
7.3.1.20.2	Prajapati is indeed the generator of the Earth.
7.3.1.20.3	This means, "May Prajapati not injure me."
7.3.1.20.4	Or, he who created heaven and earth with true dharma.
7.3.1.20.5	This is what it means: "He who created heaven and true dharma."
7.3.1.20.6	And who created the waters and the moon first?
7.3.1.20.7	The waters are the humans and the moon.
7.3.1.20.8	This means: "He created the humans first."
7.3.1.20.9	To which god shall we offer oblations?
7.3.1.20.10	Prajapati is the "who."
7.3.1.21.2	As the Yajus, so the Bandhu.
7.3.1.21.3	"Agni, the eager one, has ascended your Vapa."
7.3.1.21.4	Whatever is in her, that is her Vapa.
7.3.1.21.5	Agni, the keen one, ascends it.
7.3.1.21.6	Having brought it, he places it between the joints of the wings on his body.
7.3.1.21.7	He places it here, in this (part of the altar), that which flowed out as juice in the southern direction.
7.3.1.21.8	And he thus establishes the southern direction in him.
7.3.1.22.1	Then behind (the fire) he says, "That which is bright, which is bright, that which is pure, which is pure, that which is fit for sacrifice, which is fit for sacrifi
7.3.1.22.2	This is Agni.
7.3.1.22.3	He says that to her, and says, "Thou carriest it to the gods."
7.3.1.22.4	"This is for the god of the sacrifice, we offer it." This is what is said.
7.3.1.22.5	Having brought it, he places it between the tail and the body.
7.3.1.22.6	He places in it that juice which flowed towards the west.
7.3.1.22.7	And he places in it the western direction.
7.3.1.22.8	He should not bring it from the front, lest he should bring the juice from the path of the sacrifice.
7.3.1.22.9	He brings it from here.
7.3.1.23.1	Then from the north, "I take the strength and nourishment from here."
7.3.1.23.2	It means, "I take strength and nourishment from this."
7.3.1.23.3	"The womb of truth."
7.3.1.23.4	Truth is indeed truth.
7.3.1.23.5	It means, "The womb of truth."
7.3.1.23.6	"The stream of the buffalo."
7.3.1.23.7	Agni is the male goat.
7.3.1.23.8	For he, having been born, has pervaded everything.
7.3.1.23.9	"May it enter me among the cows, among the bodies."
7.3.1.23.10	The body is the self.
7.3.1.23.11	"May (Agni) enter me among the cattle and among the self." This is what is meant.
7.3.1.23.12	"I abandon the seat of the unassailable one." He destroys the sand.
7.3.1.23.13	That very same (earth) which is the earth, the earth, the same he places in this direction.
7.3.1.23.14	Therefore in this direction the creatures are most hungry.
7.3.1.23.15	Having brought it, he places it between the joints of the wings on himself.
7.3.1.23.16	That juice which flowed in the northern direction, that he places in this.
7.3.1.24.10	He recites various benedictions.
7.3.1.24.11	The directions are various.
7.3.1.24.12	He places them while standing.
7.3.1.24.13	The directions indeed are standing.
7.3.1.24.14	And he who stands is more vigorous.
7.3.1.25.1	These bricks are indeed mantric.
7.3.1.25.2	He places these on the body itself, not on the wings and tail.
7.3.1.25.3	For mantric bricks are indeed placed on the body itself and not on the wings or tail.
7.3.1.26.1	They say, how are these cooked, boiled and offered?
7.3.1.26.2	They are indeed the essence.
7.3.1.26.3	The essence is self-boiled.
7.3.1.26.4	And whatever one approaches this Agni Vaiśvānara, that becomes cooked, boiled and is offered.
7.3.1.27.1	Then he pours on the northern altar.
7.3.1.27.2	This is the altar.
7.3.1.27.3	The northern altar is the sky.
7.3.1.27.4	The bricks of the quarters are the Lokamantras.
7.3.1.27.5	In that he places the bricks of the quarters between the Vedi and the Uttaravedi, he places the quarters between these two worlds.
7.3.1.27.6	Therefore the quarters are between these two worlds
7.3.1.27.7	He makes it a yojana in length or forty steps, whichever he wishes.
7.3.1.27.8	Then he spreads sand.
7.3.1.27.9	Its relation is explained.
7.3.1.28.1	He pours down the two northern sacrificial-posts.
7.3.1.28.2	The northern sacrificial-post is the womb.
7.3.1.28.3	He pours down the seed in the womb.
7.3.1.28.4	What seed is poured down in the womb, that becomes generative.
7.3.1.28.5	He covers the whole of himself with them.
7.3.1.28.6	He places the seed in the whole of himself.
7.3.1.28.7	Therefore seed is produced from the whole of the body.
7.3.1.29.1	"O Agni, may thy fame be ours."
7.3.1.29.2	His smoke is his fame, his radiance is his age.
7.3.1.29.3	For he makes him heard in the other world.
7.3.1.29.4	"The great shining Arcis, the luminous ones."
7.3.1.29.5	"The great, shining Arcis, those who have much light."
7.3.1.29.6	"The bright sun, with strength, the praiseworthy strength."
7.3.1.29.7	Strength is the same as power.
7.3.1.30.4	"Thou art kindled with the unextinguished light, O Sun." This is what it means.
7.3.1.30.5	"The son, wandering with his mother, comes to rest."
7.3.1.30.6	For this son, wandering with its mother, comes to a resting place.
7.3.1.30.7	"Thou fillest both the heavens and the earth."
7.3.1.30.8	These are the heaven and earth.
7.3.1.30.9	He fills them both with smoke, this one, and with rain, that one.
7.3.1.31.1	O Jātavedas, the giver of strength, with good praises.
7.3.1.31.2	O Jātavedasa, the giver of wealth, with good praises, so it is.
7.3.1.31.3	Sing with the praises that are beneficial.
7.3.1.31.4	Shine with the praises that bring benefit, so it is said.
7.3.1.31.5	You have been entrusted with the wealth by the gods, with much wealth.
7.3.1.31.6	"You have arranged the many-streamed rays." This is what it means.
7.3.1.31.7	"The variegated ones, born of the good," this is what it means
7.3.1.31.8	Just as the Yajus, so is the meaning.
7.3.1.32.1	"O Agni, shining, spread with the creatures." This is what is meant.
7.3.1.32.2	Humans are creatures.
7.3.1.32.3	"Shining, O Agni, spread with humans." This is what the meaning is.
7.3.1.32.4	"For us, O immortal, for wealth."
7.3.1.32.5	He bestows on us immortal wealth.
7.3.1.32.6	"He shines with the splendor of his form."
7.3.1.32.7	For he shines with the splendor, with the form of his body.
7.3.1.32.8	"He fills the eternal sacrifice."
7.3.1.32.9	He fills the eternal rite.
7.3.1.33.1	"The creator of the sacrifice, the wise one."
7.3.1.33.2	The sacrifice is the rite.
7.3.1.33.3	"The creator of the sacrifice, the Pracetas." This is what it means.
7.3.1.33.4	"The great wealth that is being destroyed."
7.3.1.33.5	"The great destruction of wealth." This is what is meant.
7.3.1.33.6	"The wealth of the good, the great, the auspicious."
7.3.1.33.7	"The wealth, the great, auspicious, of the good." This is what the verse means.
7.3.1.33.8	"You bestow the wealth of the good."
7.3.1.34.10	The divine Agni, the most excellent, we have heard with our ears. The men in the two ages (say), 'We call the divine Agni, the best, with our words.'
7.3.1.34.11	This is the meaning: 'We call the god Agni, the best with our words.' This is the meaning.
7.3.1.35.1	This Agni Vaisvānara is indeed this (verse) of six verses.
7.3.1.35.2	These sand-grains are placed for the beginning.
7.3.1.35.3	He pours the semen in the form of Agni Vaiśvānara into him.
7.3.1.35.4	With the six-verse (hymn).
7.3.1.35.5	The year has six seasons.
7.3.1.35.6	The year is Vaiśvānaran.
7.3.1.36.1	They say, "What is the form of the semen of those (stones) called sand?"
7.3.1.36.2	One should say, "White."
7.3.1.36.3	For semen is white.
7.3.1.36.4	And also, "Spotted."
7.3.1.36.5	For the semen is like a drop.
7.3.1.37.1	They say, "How can the dry sand become the moist form of semen when the semen is moist and the sand is dry?"
7.3.1.37.2	The Chhandas are indeed the essence.
7.3.1.37.3	The essence is moist.
7.3.1.37.4	When he offers them with the Chhandas, then indeed they become the moist form.
7.3.1.38.1	They say, how are these (days) related to the day and night?
7.3.1.38.2	There are two days and nights, the bright and the dark.
7.3.1.38.3	There are two kinds of grass, the white and the black.
7.3.1.38.4	Thus these (days) are related to the day-and-night.
7.3.1.39.1	They say, how are they related to the days and nights, being complete, not deficient or excessive?
7.3.1.39.2	The days and nights are endless.
7.3.1.39.3	The sand is endless.
7.3.1.39.4	Thus, indeed, these days and nights are completed, not deficient, not in excess, and are deposited.
7.3.1.39.5	Now, why is it called the ocean-like metre?
7.3.1.39.6	The ocean is endless.
7.3.1.39.7	The sands are endless.
7.3.1.39.8	That is the ocean-like meter.
7.3.1.40.1	They say, how are these (bricks) offered separately with different formulas?
7.3.1.40.2	The mind is the formula.
7.3.1.40.3	This mind, the formula, pervades all the sand.
7.3.1.40.4	Thus indeed, these (bricks) are offered separately with different formulae.
7.3.1.41.1	They say, how are they offered with all the metres?
7.3.1.41.2	Whatever he pours down with this six-verse (hymn),
7.3.1.41.3	as many syllables as there are in the seven metres, so many syllables are there in this six-verse hymn.
7.3.1.41.4	Thus indeed, they are endowed with all the metres.
7.3.1.42.1	Whatever sand he pours down,
7.3.1.42.2	this Agni is Prajapati.
7.3.1.42.3	All this is Brahman, Prajapati.
7.3.1.42.4	That which is the sand when the Brahman is burnt down,
7.3.1.42.5	and that which is not burnt down, that is this Agni which is being piled up.
7.3.1.42.6	When he pours down the sand, he restores to it what of the Brahman was burnt down.
7.3.1.42.7	He pours down the sand which is innumerable and unlimited.
7.3.1.42.8	Who knows how much of that Brahman is destroyed?
7.3.1.42.9	He indeed makes this entire Prajapati complete who, knowing thus, scatters sand.
7.3.1.43.1	They say, "What is the number of these innumerable?"
7.3.1.43.2	One should say, "Two."
7.3.1.43.3	For there are two kinds of sand: white and black.
7.3.1.43.4	One should say "Twenty-seven hundred."
7.3.1.43.5	For so many are the days and nights in a year.
7.3.1.43.6	Or else, two hundred and fifty.
7.3.1.43.7	For so many are the syllables in this six-versed (hymn).
7.3.1.43.8	Or else, twenty-five.
7.3.1.43.9	For twenty-five is the seed.
7.3.1.44.1	These are the bricks with Yajus.
7.3.1.44.2	He places them on himself, not on the wings and tail.
7.3.1.44.3	The bricks are laid down on the body itself, not on the wings and tail.
7.3.1.44.4	He does not settle them lest he should settle the seed and procreation.
7.3.1.45.1	Then he touches them with the verses containing the word 'apya' (increase).
7.3.1.45.2	He thus makes the seed which has been sprinkled increase.
7.3.1.45.3	Therefore the seed sprinkled in the womb increases.
7.3.1.45.4	With the verses containing the words 'somi' (Soma).
7.3.1.45.5	Soma is indeed the breath.
7.3.1.45.6	He places the breath in the semen.
7.3.1.45.7	Therefore, semen, when deposited, comes into existence with the breath.
7.3.1.45.8	If it were to come into existence without the breath, it would perish.
7.3.1.45.9	This indeed is the Sūdadoha here.
7.3.1.45.10	The breath is indeed the Soma, the Sūdadohas.
7.3.1.46.1	"Grow, may thy strength be united from all sides, O Soma."
7.3.1.46.2	The semen is indeed strength.
7.3.1.46.3	"May you grow, may you be united with all. Soma, your seed." This is what it means.
7.3.1.46.4	"May you be united with the strength of food."
7.3.1.46.5	Strength is food.
7.3.1.46.6	"May we be united with the food." This is what is meant.
7.3.1.46.7	"May your juices unite, may your strengths unite."
7.3.1.46.8	Juices are sap.
7.3.1.46.9	Strengths are food.
7.3.1.46.10	"Let your juices unite, let your foods unite." This is what this means.
7.3.1.46.11	"United with the strength of the Vrishni, the conqueror."
7.3.1.46.12	"The semen is united with sin." This is what it means.
7.3.1.46.13	"Growing, for immortality, in Soma." This is what is meant.
7.3.1.46.14	He places immortality in the progeny.
7.3.1.46.15	Therefore progeny is immortal.
7.3.1.46.16	"Place the best of the ears in heaven."
7.3.1.46.17	The moon is his best ear in heaven.
7.3.1.46.18	For he makes him heard in the other world.
7.3.1.46.19	He makes it grow with two (verses), namely, the Gāyatrī and the Tristubh.
7.3.1.46.20	Its relation has been explained.
7.3.1.47.1	Now, indeed, this is the prosperity itself.
7.3.1.47.2	He places four bricks of the Loka-class.
7.3.1.47.3	He pours down with a verse consisting of six syllables.
7.3.1.47.4	He makes it grow with (two) two (verses).
7.3.1.47.5	That makes twelve.
7.3.1.47.6	Twelve months are a year.
7.3.1.47.7	The year is Agni.
7.3.1.47.8	Whatever is the extent of Agni, whatever is his measure, so much does it become.
7.3.2.1.1	Having touched with the two verses beginning with "O Agni, do thou come to us," one proceeds with Atithyena.
7.3.2.1.2	Having proceeded with Atithyena, one proceeds with Pravargya and Upasad.
7.3.2.1.3	Having proceeded by Pravargya and Upanad, one then completes the Citi on the skin.
7.3.2.1.4	That is because the skin is the form. For the attainment of forms.
7.3.2.1.5	from the hair.
7.3.2.1.6	Hair is the form of forms, for the attainment of forms.
7.3.2.1.7	In the red one.
7.3.2.1.8	In the reddish one, all forms, for the attainmnet of all forms.
7.3.2.1.9	In a bull.
7.3.2.1.10	This is Agni, for the attainment Agni-forms.
7.3.2.1.11	In the one facing east.
7.3.2.1.12	That is divine.
7.3.2.2.1	Then, having placed it in front of the Garhapatya, he spreads it on the Uttaravedi with the skin of a black antelope, with the hair pointing towards the north and the neck towards the east.
7.3.2.2.2	They make this layer even.
7.3.2.2.3	Then he sprinkles it.
7.3.2.2.4	When he sprinkles it, he makes it pure and fit for sacrifice.
7.3.2.2.5	With ghee.
7.3.2.2.6	For that is pure and fit for the sacrifice.
7.3.2.2.7	And also for non-crossing.
7.3.2.2.8	For they do not sprinkle any other oblation than ghee.
7.3.2.2.9	Silently.
7.3.2.2.10	That which is silent is undefined.
7.3.2.2.11	All is undefined.
7.3.2.2.12	He makes it pure and fit by all.
7.3.2.2.13	And also for non-obstruction.
7.3.2.2.14	For they do not sprinkle silently any other oblation.
7.3.2.3.1-9	Whatever he sprinkles, it is indeed the oblation. He pours it over. Whatever oblation is sprinkled and poured over, it is agreeable and fit for sacrifice. With ghee. For with ghee they pour over the oblation. Silently. For silently they pour over the offering. With darbha-blades. For they are pure and fit for sacrifice.
7.3.2.3.10	with the foremost (bricks).
7.3.2.3.11	For the foremost is the god of gods.
7.3.2.4.1	They say, "When he sprinkles the first layer of bricks, how is this entire Agni sprinkled? How is it carried on the skin? How is it led by a horse?"
7.3.2.4.2	When he sprinkles the bricks of all the layers, then indeed this entire fire becomes sprinkled. When the skin is taken out, then the horse is taken out.
7.3.2.4.3	They raise this layer.
7.3.2.5.1	Then he says, "Recite the formula when the fires are being taken out."
7.3.2.5.2	The gods were about to perform this sacrifice when the Rākṣasas, the fiends, attacked them, saying, "Ye shall not perform, ye shall not perform this sacrifice."
7.3.2.5.3	They made these fires and these bricks into thunderbolts with sharp edges and struck them.
7.3.2.5.4	They destroyed them with them.
7.3.2.5.5	Having covered them, they performed this sacrifice in a place free from fear and danger.
7.3.2.6.1	This is what is done now, because the gods did it. Those demons were destroyed by the gods.
7.3.2.6.2	When one does this, one says, "I am doing what the gods did."
7.3.2.7.3	Now, as to why they say, "When being carried away."
7.3.2.7.4	For he carries away.
7.3.2.8.1	Some recite thus: "The fires are the excreta, with the Pravaṇas, in unison."
7.3.2.8.2	It is the form of the Pravaṇa.
7.3.2.8.3	One should not do so.
7.3.2.8.4	One should recite the Agniya Gāyatrī verses, as one wishes.
7.3.2.8.5	"Thy mind, O calf, has been attracted to thee; those Angiras, Agni, in thy dear abodes."
7.3.2.9.1	The Agniya verses are recited; they are of the form of Agni for the attainment of Agni. They are of the form Kaamavati for the attainment of desires. They are of Gāyatrī metre.
7.3.2.9.2	Agni is of Gāyatrī metre.
7.3.2.9.3	Agneya verses are recited. As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with that much he pours down the semen of Agni.
7.3.2.9.4	Three.
7.3.2.9.5	Agni is threefold.
7.3.2.9.6	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with that he sprinkles him, having become semen.
7.3.2.9.7	They become seven, together with the three repetitions.
7.3.2.9.8	Agni has seven layers.
7.3.2.9.9	The year has seven seasons.
7.3.2.9.10	Agni (is) the year.
7.3.2.9.11	As much as Agni, as much as his measure, so much is that.
7.3.2.9.12	He recites in a low voice.
7.3.2.9.13	The sacrifice is semen here.
7.3.2.9.14	Semen is indeed deposited in a low voice,
7.3.2.9.15	Following behind, he recites.
7.3.2.9.16	He thus goes following the sacrifice with the metres from behind.
7.3.2.10.1	Then they lead a white horse in front.
7.3.2.10.2	The gods were afraid of this, thinking, "May the Rakshas and the Asuras not destroy us here."
7.3.2.10.3	They saw this thunderbolt, namely, the sun.
7.3.2.10.4	This is the horse, namely, the Sun.
7.3.2.10.5	With this thunderbolt they drove away the Rakshas, the Asuras, in front, and attained safety, freedom from fear, and freedom from destruction.
7.3.2.10.6	In the same way, the sacrificer, with this thunderbolt, having removed the Rakshas and the Asuras from the front, attains safety and prosperity.
7.3.2.10.7	They approach the fire.
7.3.2.10.8	They place the covering of the tail on the right side.
7.3.2.10.9	They make the horse enter on the north.
7.3.2.11.1	They lead it towards the east between the northern half of the fire and the enclosing sticks.
7.3.2.11.2	It removes evil from the eastern direction.
7.3.2.11.3	That to the south.
7.3.2.11.4	It removes evil from the southern direction.
7.3.2.11.5	That towards the west.
7.3.2.11.6	It removes the evil from the western direction.
7.3.2.11.7	That upwards.
7.3.2.11.8	It removes from the northern direction.
7.3.2.11.9	He releases it towards the north, towards the east, to ward off the Rākṣasas, the fiends, from all directions.
7.3.2.11.10	Its relation has been explained.
7.3.2.12.1	He makes it smell this layer while moving towards the west.
7.3.2.12.2	This horse is indeed the sun.
7.3.2.12.3	These are all beings, these bricks.
7.3.2.12.4	When he makes him smell it, he smells all these creatures.
7.3.2.12.5	Therefore he thinks, "I am all of that," by the power of Prajapati.
7.3.2.12.6	When he makes him smell the one who is going away, he smells all those creatures who are going away.
7.3.2.13.1	When he smells it,
7.3.2.13.2	This is the horse, that is the sun.
7.3.2.13.3	These are the worlds, these are the naturally-perforated stones.
7.3.2.13.4	When he makes him smell (the stones), then he unites these worlds with the sun in the thread.
7.3.2.13.5	What is that thread, that is the bond above.
7.3.2.14.1	What he makes him smell,
7.3.2.14.2	Agni departed from the gods.
7.3.2.14.3	He entered the waters.
7.3.2.14.4	The gods said to Prajapati, "You search for him."
7.3.2.14.5	He will appear to you as your own father."
7.3.2.14.6	The horse, having become white, searched for him.
7.3.2.14.7	He found him on a lotus leaf, flowing out from the waters.
7.3.2.14.8	He looked at him.
7.3.2.14.9	He rose up to him.
7.3.2.14.10	Therefore the horse is white, like a well-tamed face.
7.3.2.14.11	And indeed, the Durasas are very sensitive.
7.3.2.14.12	He thought, "He is indeed like a ritual."
7.3.2.14.13	He said to him, "I give you a boon."
7.3.2.15.1	He said, "Whoever finds you in this form, may he find you."
7.3.2.15.2	He who seeks him in this form, indeed finds him.
7.3.2.15.3	Having known him, one should make him.
7.3.2.16.1	He should be white.
7.3.2.16.2	For that is the form of him who shines.
7.3.2.16.3	If one does not find a white one, it may be a non-white one.
7.3.2.16.4	It should be a horse.
7.3.2.16.5	If one cannot find a horse, it may be an ox.
7.3.2.16.6	The ox is indeed Agni.
7.3.2.16.7	Agni is the remover of all sins.
7.3.2.17.1	Now, then, about the mounting of the fire.
7.3.2.17.2	Some mount it facing east or west.
7.3.2.17.3	One should not do so.
7.3.2.17.4	The fire is an animal.
7.3.2.17.5	He who mounts the animal facing east or west, kills it with the two horns.
7.3.2.17.6	Then he mounts him from the rear, facing east, with his feet.
7.3.2.17.7	He should mount him as if he were himself.
7.3.2.17.8	He who mounts an animal with himself (i.e. as if he were mounting himself) succeeds and does not injure.
7.3.2.17.9	They mount any animal from the north.
7.3.2.17.10	They mount him from the north itself.
7.3.2.17.11	Having mounted the fire, having performed the rite pertaining to the northern altar, he takes Agni into himself.
7.3.2.17.12	Having taken Agni into himself, he sings the truth as the Sama.
7.3.2.17.13	He places the lotus leaf.
7.3.2.17.14	From that.
7.3.2.18.1	Then in the evening they lead the horse around.
7.3.2.18.2	The gods were afraid, thinking, "What if the Raksases and demons do not kill him here?"
7.3.2.18.3	Therefore they made this thunderbolt his protector, namely the sun.
7.3.2.18.4	This very sun is this horse.
7.3.2.18.5	In the same way, he makes this thunderbolt his protector.
7.3.2.19.1	He leads him around the setting sun.
7.3.2.19.2	This is his direct protector by day.
7.3.2.19.3	The demons are active at night.
7.3.2.19.4	By night, he makes this very thunderbolt his protector.
7.3.2.19.5-12	He turns it around in all directions. He makes this thunderbolt his protector in all directions. He turns it three times. He makes it his protector in all three directions. Then he releases it towards the east. Its binding is explained. Then it is again untied. Its binding above is explained.
7.4.1.1.1	One who is about to perform the Agnihotra should take up the fire in himself.
7.4.1.1.2	He generates it from himself.
7.4.1.1.3	One becomes like the one from whom one is born.
7.4.1.1.4	If one were to build the fire without taking it in oneself, one would generate a human being from a human being, a mortal from a mortal, one with unremoved sins from one with unremoved sin.
7.4.1.1.5	Now when he takes Agni in himself and builds it, he generates Agni from Agni, the immortal from the immortal, the sinless from the sinless.
7.4.1.2.1	He takes it with the verse, "I take Agni in myself first."
7.4.1.2.2	He takes Agni in himself first.
7.4.1.2.3	For prosperity, for good offspring, for good strength.
7.4.1.2.4	He takes all blessings into himself.
7.4.1.2.5	"May the deities be with me."
7.4.1.2.6	He takes all the gods into himself.
7.4.1.2.7	Whatever he is going to generate for himself, he takes all that into himself.
7.4.1.2.8	He, standing, takes up the fire in himself and then sitting down, builds it.
7.4.1.2.9	The fire is indeed an animal.
7.4.1.2.10	Therefore, standing, an animal gives birth to the embryo and then sitting down gives birth.
7.4.1.3.1	Then he sings the truth-sāman.
7.4.1.3.2	The gods said, "Let us make this his truth-face."
7.4.1.3.3	We shall be truthful.
7.4.1.3.4	He will follow our truth.
7.4.1.3.5	Our desire will be true, whatever we desire, we will do."
7.4.1.4.1	They sang this truth-chant in front.
7.4.1.4.2	It made his mouth true.
7.4.1.4.3	They became true.
7.4.1.4.4	Truth followed them.
7.4.1.4.5	Their desire became true, whatever they desired, they did.
7.4.1.5.1	In the same way, the sacrificer, when he sings the truth-chanting Saman in front, makes his mouth truthful.
7.4.1.5.2	He becomes truthful.
7.4.1.5.3	Truth follows him. His desire becomes true, whatever desire he performs this for.
7.4.1.6.1	And that truth is indeed the waters.
7.4.1.6.2	For the waters are indeed truth.
7.4.1.6.3	Therefore, they say that the form of truth is that by which the waters flow.
7.4.1.6.4	They made water the foremost of all that.
7.4.1.6.5	Therefore, when the waters flow, then this entire universe comes into being, whatever it is.
7.4.1.7.1	Then he places the lotus leaf.
7.4.1.7.2	The lotus leaf is the womb.
7.4.1.7.3	He places the womb.
7.4.1.8.1	The reason why he places the lotus-leaf is
7.4.1.8.2	that the lotus is water.
7.4.1.8.3	And this is its leaf.
7.4.1.8.4	Just as this lotus-leaf is placed in the water, so is this (earth) placed in the water.
7.4.1.8.5	This is the womb of Agni,
7.4.1.8.6	for this is Agni.
7.4.1.8.7	For all Agni is built on this.
7.4.1.8.8	He places it on this (earth).
7.4.1.8.9	He places it close to the truth.
7.4.1.8.10	He establishes this on truth.
7.4.1.8.11	Therefore this is established on truth.
7.4.1.8.12	This alone is truth.
7.4.1.8.13	This is the most stable of these worlds.
7.4.1.9.1	"He says, "Thou art the back of the waters, the womb of Agni."
7.4.1.9.2	This is the back of the water.
7.4.1.9.3	This is the womb of Agni.
7.4.1.9.4	"He is spreading out, encompassing the ocean."
7.4.1.9.5	The ocean is spreading out, surrounding this (earth).
7.4.1.9.6	"He is growing, great and wide like a lotus."
7.4.1.9.7	He is growing, greater and wider like a lotus.
7.4.1.9.8	"Spread out with the measure of heaven, with greatness." He anoints in accordance with the text.
7.4.1.9.9	This is the sun, this is Agni.
7.4.1.9.10	No other than this one deserves to be the highest in heaven.
7.4.1.9.11	He says this, 'May heaven protect him.'
7.4.1.9.12	The Suddha-ti (brick) is placed.
7.4.1.9.13	For the Suddha-ti is the sovereignty of waters.
7.4.1.9.14	Having placed it, he recites the Suda-dohana verse.
7.4.1.9.15	Its relation has been explained.
7.4.1.10.1	Then he places the golden (brick).
7.4.1.10.2	This golden (brick) is the sun.
7.4.1.10.3	For he shines over all these creatures.
7.4.1.10.4	They call him Rocha, the Shining One, indirectly.
7.4.1.10.5	For the gods desire to know indirectly.
7.4.1.10.6	He thereby places that very Aditya.
7.4.1.10.7	It is made of gold, circular, with twenty-one openings.
7.4.1.10.8	Its relation has been explained.
7.4.1.10.9	He places the opening below.
7.4.1.10.10	The rays of this (sun) are unobstructed.
7.4.1.10.11	The rays of this (Sun) are on the left side.
7.4.1.11.1	He places the lotus-leaf on it.
7.4.1.11.2	The lotus-leaf is the womb.
7.4.1.11.3	He thus establishes him in the womb.
7.4.1.12.1	In that he places the lotus- leaf,
7.4.1.12.2	the lotus-leaf is indeed a support.
7.4.1.12.3	This (earth) is the lotus-leaf.
7.4.1.12.4	This indeed is the support.
7.4.1.12.5	Or he who is far away, though not established in it, is indeed established.
7.4.1.12.6	He is established in it by means of rays.
7.4.1.12.7	He establishes him in this very establishment.
7.4.1.13.1	Now, why he places the lotus leaf.
7.4.1.13.2	Indra, having killed Vritra, entered the waters, thinking, "There is no thirst."
7.4.1.13.3	She said, "I am afraid. Make a city for me."
7.4.1.13.4	The water that was the essence of the waters, they brought up above.
7.4.1.13.5	They made a city for him.
7.4.1.13.6	Because they made a city for it, it is Pūṣkara.
7.4.1.13.7	That is why they call it Pūṣkara, indirectly.
7.4.1.13.8	The gods desire indirectly.
7.4.1.13.9	When he places the lotus leaf, he establishes him in that very place where the waters brought him his sap and made a city for him.
7.4.1.14.1	"Brahma, the unborn, the first, in front."
7.4.1.14.2	The sun is indeed Brahma.
7.4.1.14.3	It is born every day in front.
7.4.1.14.4	"It shines forth from the boundary, the bright one, from the darkness."
7.4.1.14.5	The middle is the boundary.
7.4.1.14.6	These worlds are well-shining.
7.4.1.14.7	That sun is Vena.
7.4.1.14.8	For when he was born, he was born without a penis, hence Vena.
7.4.1.14.9	He rises, separating them from the boundary and the middle.
7.4.1.14.10	His dwelling is like the banks.
7.4.1.14.11	His dwelling are like the directions.
7.4.1.14.12	For he dwells on them.
7.4.1.14.13	And the source of the existent and the non-existent.
7.4.1.14.14	These indeed are the worlds, the source of the existing and the non-existing.
7.4.1.14.15	For what exists and what does not exist is born from these worlds.
7.4.1.14.16	He lays down the Tristubh verses.
7.4.1.14.17	For this is the Tristubh.
7.4.1.14.18	Having settled, he recites the Sūdadohas together.
7.4.1.14.19	Its relation has been explained.
7.4.1.16.2	From the relaxed body of Prajapati, a beautiful form emerged from the middle.
7.4.1.16.3	The gods placed him in that longing form.
7.4.1.16.4	Where the gods assembled him, they placed this beautiful form in his middle.
7.4.1.16.5	The Gods enjoyed in that form.
7.4.1.16.6	Now, because the gods delighted in this beautiful body of his, therefore it is delightful.
7.4.1.16.7	And that which is delightful, that they call gold, indirectly.
7.4.1.16.8	For the gods desire indirectly.
7.4.1.16.9	And so he places this beautiful body of him in the middle.
7.4.1.16.10	And in it the gods delight.
7.4.1.16.11	The breath is his beautiful body.
7.4.1.16.12	He places this breath in the middle of him.
7.4.1.17.1	He places the golden one.
7.4.1.17.2	This is the golden one. This is the golden one, the sun.
7.4.1.17.3	And the man in this circle, that is he. He places him here.
7.4.1.18.1	He places him with the face upwards.
7.4.1.18.2	The gods said this: "If we were to place them below, everything would be burnt.
7.4.1.18.3	If we were to put them above, they would burn only above.
7.4.1.18.4	If we put them together, then this light would be between them.
7.4.1.18.5	But they would injure each other."
7.4.1.18.6	They placed the other one facing downwards.
7.4.1.18.7	This one shines downwards with rays, the golden one; this one upwards, the man.
7.4.1.18.8	He places it facing east.
7.4.1.18.9	For this Agni is indeed built facing east.
7.4.1.19.1	"He says, "The golden embryo came forth first."
7.4.1.19.2	For this indeed is the golden embryo that came forth first.
7.4.1.19.3	The one who was born is the lord of all that exists.
7.4.1.19.4	For he was the one who was born as the lord of all this that exists.
7.4.1.19.5	He supported the earth and the sky.
7.4.1.19.6	For he indeed supported heaven and earth.
7.4.1.19.7	To which god shall we offer oblations?
7.4.1.19.8	Prajapati is the one.
7.4.1.19.9	To him we offer oblations. This is it.
7.4.1.20.1	And the drops spread over the earth and heaven.
7.4.1.20.2	The sun is the drops.
7.4.1.20.3	It spreads over heaven and earth. This means 'over this one' (i.e. heaven) and 'over that one' (i,e. earth).
7.4.1.20.4	The one who follows this womb and the one who was before.
7.4.1.20.5	This means 'this world' and 'that world'.
7.4.1.20.6	And also what is being sown now and what was sown before.
7.4.1.20.7	"He moves in the same womb."
7.4.1.20.8	For he indeed moves in the same kind of womb.
7.4.1.20.9	"He offers the drop, following the seven Hotrs."
7.4.1.20.10	The sun is the drop.
7.4.1.20.11	The directions are the seven Hotrs.
7.4.1.20.12	He thus establishes that sun in the directions.
7.4.1.21.1	He places it with two (verses),
7.4.1.21.2	because the Sacrificer has two feet.
7.4.1.21.3	The sacrificer is Agni.
7.4.1.21.4	He places him in this way, as much as Agni is, as much as is his measure.
7.4.1.21.5	With three Tristubh verses.
7.4.1.21.6	For this (Agni) is connected with the Tristubh metre.
7.4.1.21.7	Having settled (the bricks), he recites the Sūdadoha formula.
7.4.1.21.8	Its relation has been explained.
7.4.1.22.1	Then he sings the Saman.
7.4.1.22.2	The gods, having placed this man, saw him as he is, like this dry piece of wood.
7.4.1.23.1	They said, "Let us know how to put power in this man."
7.4.1.23.2	They said, “Let us think.”
7.4.1.23.3	They said, indeed, “Let us desire the Cit.”
7.4.1.24.9	Having placed it, one should not go beyond it, lest the fire should burn him.
7.4.1.25.1	Then one worships with the names of serpents:
7.4.1.25.2	These worlds are serpents.
7.4.1.25.3	They all move with this entire (world), whatever it is.
7.4.1.25.4	The fire is indeed the Self of all the gods.
7.4.1.25.5	Those gods, having taken this self, were afraid. They thought, "If these worlds do not move with this self, then..."
7.4.1.26.1	They saw these names of serpents.
7.4.1.26.2	They approached them.
7.4.1.26.3	With them they established these worlds.
7.4.1.26.4	With them, they bent down.
7.4.1.26.5	Because they bent down, they are called serpents.
7.4.1.26.6	In the same way, when the sacrificer worships with the Serpent-names, he establishes these worlds for him, he bends these worlds.
7.4.1.26.7	Thus indeed, these (worlds) do not move away from him with this (worship).
7.4.1.27.1	When he worships with the serpent-names,
7.4.1.27.2	These worlds are serpents.
7.4.1.27.3	Whatever moves, it moves in these worlds.
7.4.1.27.4	When he worships with the names of serpents, he thereby appeases all that is hostile in these worlds, that which is in the sky, that which is on the earth, and that which is in heaven.
7.4.1.28.1	"Salutation to the serpents, whatever they are, who are on the earth, in the sky, and in heaven."
7.4.1.28.2	He thus pays homage to the serpents in these three worlds.
7.4.1.29.1	The arrows of the Yatudhanas.
7.4.1.29.2	Some bite, sent by the Yatudhan.
7.4.1.29.3	Those who are in the trees and those who lie in the holes, to them the serpents, salutations.
7.4.1.29.4	To those serpents who are in the plants and those who lie down in the holes, he offers salutations.
7.4.1.30.1	Those who are in the waters, those who are in the light of heaven, those who are on the rays of the sun, whose assembly is in the waters, to them, to the serpents, salutations.
7.4.1.30.2	Wherever they are, he pays homage to them here.
7.4.1.30.3	"Salutations, salutations."
7.4.1.30.4	Sacrifice is salutations.
7.4.1.30.5	He pays homage to them with this homage of sacrifice.
7.4.1.30.6	Therefore one should not say, "It is not for the sacrifice." One should say, "It belongs to the sacrifice."
7.4.1.30.7	As one would say, "It belonged to the sacrifice," so it is.
7.4.1.31.1	One approaches with three (verses).
7.4.1.31.2	These are the three worlds.
7.4.1.31.3	And Agni is threefold.
7.4.1.31.4	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, by so much he establishes him in these worlds.
7.4.1.31.5	And thus it is that he appeases all this by just that much.
7.4.1.31.6	Standing, he offers the Upatiṣṭha.
7.4.1.31.7	The worlds indeed stand as if standing.
7.4.1.31.8	And standing, one is indeed more vigorous.
7.4.1.32.1	Then, having sat down, he offers with ghee taken five times.
7.4.1.32.2	Its relation has been explained.
7.4.1.32.3	All around, moving.
7.4.1.32.4	He thus propitiates him with food from all directions.
7.4.1.33.1	And why he offers the oblation,
7.4.1.33.2	The gods, having placed themselves in this (earth), were afraid of this (earth). They thought, 'How can we protect ourselves from the Rakshas and the Asuras?'
7.4.1.33.3	They saw these Rakshas-destroying oblations: 'Make the covering, the earth, firm.'
7.4.1.34.2	The ladle is made of vajra-stone.
7.4.1.34.3	He thus repels the Rākṣasas with the vajra.
7.4.1.34.4	With five handfuls.
7.4.1.34.5	The fire has five layers.
7.4.1.34.6	The year has five seasons.
7.4.1.34.7	The year is Agni.
7.4.1.34.8	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with so much he thus repels the Rakshas and the evil spirits.
7.4.1.34.9	With the Agniya verses.
7.4.1.34.10	Agni is the light-bringer, the destroyer of demons.
7.4.1.34.11	He thus drives away the demons and fiends by means of Agni.
7.4.1.34.12	With Tristubh verses.
7.4.1.34.13	The Tristubh is the thunderbolt.
7.4.1.34.14	He thus strikes the demons and fiens with the thunderbolt.
7.4.1.34.15	It moves around on all sides.
7.4.1.34.16	He thus removes the demons and fients from all directions.
7.4.1.35.1	Then, having sat down to the east of the fire, then to the north, then to the south, then to the west, then having gone around to the south, he sits down to the north.
7.4.1.35.2	That is the right-hand direction.
7.4.1.35.3	That is indeed the direction of the gods.
7.4.1.35.4	Then, having not gone around, he sits down in the west, facing the east.
7.4.1.35.5	Thus his rite is performed in the east.
7.4.1.36.1	Then he places the ladles.
7.4.1.37.2	The gods were afraid of this, thinking, "May the Rakshas and demons not destroy our sacrifice from the south."
7.4.1.37.3	They saw this tree, the destroyer of Rakshas, the Karasmarya.
7.4.1.37.4	With this tree they drove away the Rakshas from the south and performed this sacrifice in safety and without fear.
7.4.1.37.5	In the same way, the sacrificer, with this tree, repels the Rākṣasas and the fiends from the south, and performs this sacrifice in a place free from danger and fiends.
7.4.1.37.6	It is filled with ghee.
7.4.1.37.7	Ghee is the thunderbolt.
7.4.1.37.8	He thus repels the Rākshasas and the fiends with the thunderbolt from the south.
7.4.1.38.1	Then he places the Udumbara tree on the north.
7.4.1.38.2	The Udumbara is the sap of strength.
7.4.1.39.5	Then Indra, having taken his strength, went away to the north.
7.4.1.39.6	He became the Udumbara tree.
7.4.1.40.1	He said to them, "Come to me, give it back to me by which you went away from me."
7.4.1.40.2	"Give us all food."
7.4.1.40.3	"You two should come to me, becoming my arms."
7.4.1.40.4	"So be it."
7.4.1.40.5	He gave them all food.
7.4.1.41.2	Whatever Agni took away from him in the form of heat, he draws it back to him. He restores it to him.
7.4.1.41.3	"The head of Agni is the peak of heaven."
7.4.1.41.4	This is indeed Agni.
7.4.1.41.5	With the Gayatri verse.
7.4.1.41.6	Agni is Gayatri.
7.4.1.41.7	He places it with as much extent as Agni has and as much as his measure.
7.4.1.41.8	It is filled with ghee.
7.4.1.41.9	Ghee is Agni's.
7.4.1.41.10	He thus propitiates him with his own share and his own juice.
7.4.1.42.1	Then he places the Udumbara (wood) towards the north with the verse, "I place it by Indra's strength."
7.4.1.42.2	Whatever strength Indra took away and went northwards, that he now restores to him.
7.4.1.42.3	"Leaders of the world and the path of sacrifice,"
7.4.1.42.4	This indeed is Indra.
7.4.1.42.5	She is Agni's, for Agni is her rite.
7.4.1.42.6	That it is a Tristubh verse, for Indra is of the Tristubh metre.
7.4.1.42.7	Indra and Agni are Agni.
7.4.1.42.8	As great as Agni is, as far as his measure extends, by so much he places her.
7.4.1.42.9	Indra Agni are all the gods.
7.4.1.42.10	Agni is of all the gods.
7.4.1.42.11	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, by so much he places her.
7.4.1.42.12	It becomes filled with curds.
7.4.1.42.13	Curd is indeed Indra's.
7.4.1.42.14	He thus pleases him with his own share, with his own juice.
7.4.1.43.1	These two are Indra and Agni, his arms.
7.4.1.43.2	They approach him with brilliance and vigour.
7.4.1.43.3	He now places the two bricks in the heart of the man, having drawn them on the place where he touches the heart.
7.4.1.43.4	This is indeed the world of these two.
7.4.1.44.1	Some place them transversely, saying, "These two arms are transverse."
7.4.1.44.2	One should not do so.
7.4.1.44.3	One should place them facing east.
7.4.1.44.4	For this Agni is indeed built facing east.
7.4.1.44.5	And thus the arms are more vigorous.
7.4.1.44.6	He places them in different places, settles them in different places and recites the Sūdadoha verse in different places.
7.4.1.44.7	These two arms are different.
7.4.1.45.1	They say, one should not make the arms of this person.
7.4.1.45.2	These two are his arms, namely these two ladles.
7.4.1.45.3	So that they do not exceed.
7.4.1.45.4	One should make them.
7.4.1.45.5	These two indeed are his arms, following these two ladles,
7.4.1.45.6	and these two are the wings.
7.4.1.45.7	Now, when he is about to place the forms in this fire, he places the Stomas, the Prsthas, and the Chandas. This is the refinement of these two, the growth of these two.
7.4.1.45.8	Therefore one should do this for this man.
7.4.2.1.1	He places the Svayamatrina.
7.4.2.1.2	This is the Svayamatrīna.
7.4.2.1.3	He places it on this (earth) only.
7.4.2.1.4	He places it close to the man.
7.4.2.1.5	The Svayambhu-brick is food.
7.4.2.1.6	This (earth) is the Svayambhu.
7.4.2.1.7	This is food.
7.4.2.1.8	For in this all food is cooked.
7.4.2.1.9	He places food close to him.
7.4.2.1.10	The northern one.
7.4.2.1.11	He places it in the north, because that is the direction of the gods.
7.4.2.2.1	Now, why he places the Svayamatrîna bricks.
7.4.2.2.2	The Svayamatrînâ is the breath.
7.4.2.2.3	For the breath indeed protects one from oneself.
7.4.2.2.4	He places the breath.
7.4.2.2.5	He places it without any intervening space from the man.
7.4.2.2.6	The Svayamâtrîna is the breath.
7.4.2.2.7	This is the self-sprouting one.
7.4.2.2.8	This is indeed the vital breath.
7.4.2.2.9	Whatever is living, all that it supports.
7.4.2.2.10	He places this vital breath in him without interruption.
7.4.2.2.11	The northern one.
7.4.2.2.12	He places the vital breath in him on the northern side.
7.4.2.3.1	And as to why he places the self-sprout, 
7.4.2.3.2	The gods, having taken Prajapati, who had fallen apart, departed.
7.4.2.3.3	When they had departed, he settled down on the foundation.
7.4.2.4.1	He who was that Prajapati who fell apart, he is indeed this Agni who is being built.
7.4.2.4.2	And that foundation, that is the first naturally grown (grass).
7.4.2.4.3	Now, when he places it here, he places it in what is his own self.
7.4.2.4.4	Therefore he places it here.
7.4.2.5.1	He places it for Prajapati.
7.4.2.5.2	For Prajapati himself placed it in his own self. He placed it in his self.
7.4.2.5.3	"It is firm."
7.4.2.5.4	It is stable.
7.4.2.5.5	"It has been established."
7.4.2.5.6	"The firm one."
7.4.2.5.7	The firm one is indeed the foundation.
7.4.2.5.8	"Covered with the work of all."
7.4.2.5.9	Prajapati is indeed the work of all.
7.4.2.5.10	That is what it means.
7.4.2.5.11	"May the ocean not kill you, may the Suparna not."
7.4.2.5.12	The ocean is indeed gold.
7.4.2.5.13	The Suparna is a man.
7.4.2.5.14	That is to say, may those two not kill you.
7.4.2.5.15	"May you cover the earth without being harmed."
7.4.2.5.16	As the Yajus, so the Bandhu.
7.4.2.6.1	"May Prajapati place thee."
7.4.2.6.2	For Prajapati saw this first layer.
7.4.2.6.3	"On the back of the waters, on the sea, here."
7.4.2.6.4	For this is the back of the water.
7.4.2.6.5	This is the sea here.
7.4.2.6.6	"The spreading, the extending."
7.4.2.6.7	For this (layer) is spreading and extending.
7.4.2.6.8	"Thou art the Earth."
7.4.2.6.9	"Thou art the Earth and the Earth."
7.4.2.7.1	Thou art the Earth.
7.4.2.7.2	For this is the Earth.
7.4.2.7.3	Thou art the Ground.
7.4.2.7.4	For this (is) the Ground.
7.4.2.7.5	Thou art Aditi.
7.4.2.7.6	This is Aditi.
7.4.2.7.7	For this gives everything here.
7.4.2.7.8	The supporter of all.
7.4.2.7.9	For everything here is supported by this.
7.4.2.7.10	The supporter (of) the universe.
7.4.2.8.4-11	For the establishment and for the conduct. These worlds are self-spread. These worlds, the establishment and the conduct. May Agni protect you. This means: May Agni guard you. With the great one, may there be welfare. This means with the great one, there be welfare. With the great one, let there be welfare. May there be welfare. This means: May there be welfare.
7.4.2.8.12	"What is the most auspicious, that is yours." This is what is said.
7.4.2.8.13	Having settled down, he recites the Sūdadoha-sāman.
7.4.2.8.14	Its relation has been explained.
7.4.2.8.15	Then he sings the Sāman.
7.4.2.8.16	The relation above it is
7.4.2.9.1	They say, "How does this person become self-spread and not spread by others?"
7.4.2.9.2	Food is self-spread.
7.4.2.9.3	Breath is self-spread.
7.4.2.9.4	The man is not dependent on food and breath.
7.4.2.10.1	Then the Dūrvā brick.
7.4.2.10.2	He places it.
7.4.2.10.3	The Dūrvā bricks are animals.
7.4.2.10.4	He places them as animals.
7.4.2.10.5	Those animals with which Agni came here without being obstructed, they are these.
7.4.2.10.6	He places those very ones.
7.4.2.10.7	He places it close to the Svayambhu-brick.
7.4.2.10.8	This (earth) is the Svayambhū-brick.
7.4.2.10.9	He thus places the animals close to it.
7.4.2.10.10	The northern one.
7.4.2.10.11	He thus puts the animals on the northern side.
7.4.2.11.1	The reason why he places the Dūrvā-brick
7.4.2.11.2	The hairs of Prajapati, when they fell off, became these plants.
7.4.2.11.3	Then the breath went out from him in the middle.
7.4.2.11.4	When it had gone out, he became weak.
7.4.2.12.1	He said, "This very one has cheated me."
7.4.2.12.2	Because he said, "He cheated me," therefore it is called Dhūrva.
7.4.2.12.3	The Dhurva is called the Dhurva, because it is hidden.
7.4.2.12.4	The gods desire what is hidden.
7.4.2.12.5	This is the Kshatra.
7.4.2.12.6	For this is the life-breath, the sap.
7.4.2.12.7	Other plants are the hairs.
7.4.2.12.8	When he lays down this (brick), he lays down all plants.
7.4.2.13.1	When the gods collected him together, they placed this life-breath, this sap, in the middle of him.
7.4.2.13.2	and in the same way he places this in it.
7.4.2.13.3	He places it close to the Svayambhuva grass.
7.4.2.13.4	This is the Svayambhūva grass.
7.4.2.13.5	He places the plants close to it.
7.4.2.13.6	The northern one.
7.4.2.13.7	He places plants north of it.
7.4.2.13.8	It should be with roots and tips for completeness.
7.4.2.14.3	"Thus do thou, O Goddess, with a thousand and a hundred, extend us."
7.4.2.14.4	As the Yajus, so the Bandhu.
7.4.2.15.1	"With a hundred thou extendest, with a thousand thou growest."
7.4.2.15.2	For with a hundred she extends.
7.4.2.15.3	With a thousand she grows.
7.4.2.15.4	"Of her, O Goddess, we offer oblations."
7.4.2.15.5	As the yajus, so is the bandhu.
7.4.2.15.6	He places it with two verses.
7.4.2.15.7	Its relation has been explained.
7.4.2.15.8	Having settled it, he recites the Sūdadohas-verse.
7.4.2.15.9	Its relation is explained.
7.4.2.16.1	Then he places the Dviyajus brick.
7.4.2.16.2	Indra and Agni desired to go to heaven.
7.4.2.16.3	They saw this brick called Dviyajūs.
7.4.2.16.4	They placed it here.
7.4.2.16.5	Having placed it in the place of that (goddess) Pratiṣṭhā, he went to the heavenly world.
7.4.2.16.6	In the same way the sacrificer, when he places the two-sacrificial-form, thinks, 'By that form and having performed that rite, Indra and Agni went to the heavenly worlds, by that form and having done that rite, I go to the heavenly worlds.'
7.4.2.16.7	That is why it is called two-sacrificial, for two deities saw it.
7.4.2.16.8	Now, why he places the two-sacrificing (bricks) is
7.4.2.16.9	The sacrificer is the two-sacrificer.
7.4.2.17.1	They say, "If he is the sacrificer, and if he is the golden man, then what is his form?"
7.4.2.17.2	His divine self is that, his human self is this.
7.4.2.17.3	And because he is golden, that is his immortal form, the form of the gods.
7.4.2.17.4	The gold is immortal.
7.4.2.17.5	Now when this (gold) is made of clay, it is his human form.
7.4.2.18.1	If he were to place it on that (gold), he would not have destroyed this (clay). The sacrificer would soon depart from this world.
7.4.2.18.2	When he destroys this (clay), he destroys his human form.
7.4.2.20.1	They say, how are these two selves of him connected by the breath, without interruption?
7.4.2.20.2	Breath indeed is the self-binding.
7.4.2.20.3	Breath is the Dūrvā brick.
7.4.2.20.4	The sacrificer is the two-sacrificer.
7.4.2.20.5	When he places the Dūrvâ brick without interruption to the self-binding, he connects and unites the breath with the breath.
7.4.2.20.6	Now, when he places the two Yajus-verses for the Dūrvā-bricks, it is the breath that is the Dūrvâ-brick.
7.4.2.20.7	The sacrificer is the two Yajuses.
7.4.2.20.8	Thus indeed, his two selves are connected with the breath and are not cut off.
7.4.2.21.1	"Those thy rays, O Agni, in the sun, those thy rays, O gods, in the sun."
7.4.2.21.2	"Rays, rays."
7.4.2.21.3	Immortality is indeed the ray.
7.4.2.22.3	For these two worlds are the seed-sower.
7.4.2.22.4	From here he sows seed upwards, in the form of smoke.
7.4.2.22.5	There is rain from there.
7.4.2.22.6	That rain comes from there.
7.4.2.22.7	And here between them are born.
7.4.2.22.8	Therefore these two worlds are seed-sowers.
7.4.2.23.1	The Viraj holds the light.
7.4.2.23.2	This world is the Viraj.
7.4.2.23.3	He holds this Agni as light.
7.4.2.23.4	"The lord of the world holds the light."
7.4.2.23.5	This world is the lord of the world.
7.4.2.23.6	He holds the light of this sun.
7.4.2.23.7	" Viraj, the lord of the two worlds, places the two worlds separately.
7.4.2.23.8	" The two worlds are separate.
7.4.2.23.9	He settles them together.
7.4.2.23.10	He makes them one.
7.4.2.23.11	Therefore the ends of the two worlds meet.
7.4.2.24.1	In that he places the semen-seed,
7.4.2.24.2	the semen-seed is the eggs.
7.4.2.24.3	For he who has eggs indeed does seed.
7.4.2.24.4	Virāj held the light.
7.4.2.24.5	Svāraj held the light. Thus it is said.
7.4.2.24.6	Virāj and Svāraj held the two eggs.
7.4.2.24.7	They hold this light.
7.4.2.24.8	He places the two eggs in the fire, the semen and Prajapati.
7.4.2.24.9	The two offerings are the two eggs.
7.4.2.24.10	He places them together.
7.4.2.24.11	He makes them equal.
7.4.2.24.12	Therefore they are of equal relationship.
7.4.2.24.13	He places these two eggs in the two Yajus formulas, without interruption.
7.4.2.24.14	The two Yajus are the sacrificer.
7.4.2.24.15	He places those two eggs in the sacrificer, without interruption.
7.4.2.25.1	Then he lays down the Viśva-jyotis (brick).
7.4.2.25.2	Agni is the first Viśva-jyotls.
7.4.2.25.3	For Agni is the all-shining light in this world.
7.4.2.25.4	He thus lays down Agni.
7.4.2.25.5	He lays it down without intervening space between the Retah-sics.
7.4.2.25.6	These two worlds are the Retah-sic.
7.4.2.25.7	He thus places Agni without intervening space between these two worlds.
7.4.2.26.7	He places the generation of the offspring within the eggs.
7.4.2.26.8	He places it within.
7.4.2.26.9	For within the eggs the offspring are generated.
7.4.2.27.1	May Prajapati place thee.
7.4.2.27.2	For Prajapati saw this first layer.
7.4.2.27.3	On the back of the earth, shining.
7.4.2.27.4	For this Agni, the luminous one, is on the back of the earth.
7.4.2.28.1	"For all the breaths, for the out-breath, for the through-breath."
7.4.2.28.2	The All-Luminous is indeed the breath.
7.4.2.28.3	This breath is for all of him.
7.4.2.28.4	"May he give all the light."
7.4.2.28.5	This means, "May he give all light."
7.4.2.28.6	"Agni is your lord."
7.4.2.28.7	He makes Agni the overlord of it.
7.4.2.28.8	Having settled it, he recites the Sūdadohas verse.
7.4.2.28.9	Its relation has been explained.
7.4.2.29.1	Then he lays down the Rtavya bricks.
7.4.2.29.2	The Rtavya bricks are the seasons.
7.4.2.29.3	He thus lays down the seasons.
7.4.2.29.4	Madhu and Mādhava are the spring seasons.
7.4.2.29.5	These are their names.
7.4.2.29.6	He places them with their names.
7.4.2.29.7	There are two bricks.
7.4.2.29.8	For two months are a season.
7.4.2.29.9	He lays them down once.
7.4.2.29.10	He makes it one season.
7.4.2.30.1	Now when he places these here, this Agni is the year.
7.4.2.30.2	These worlds are the year.
7.4.2.30.3	Of that, this world is the first layer,
7.4.2.30.4	This is his world, the spring season.
7.4.2.30.5	What he puts here, that he puts back into him.
7.4.2.30.6	Therefore he puts them here.
7.4.2.31.1	And why he puts them here,
7.4.2.31.2	This Agni is Prajapati.
7.4.2.31.3	The year is Prajapati.
7.4.2.31.4	His establishment is the first layer.
7.4.2.31.5	His establishment is the spring season.
7.4.2.31.6	What he puts here, that he puts back in him.
7.4.2.31.7	Therefore he puts them here.
7.4.2.31.8	He puts them in the Viśva-jyotiṣa (layer) without interruption.
7.4.2.31.9	Viśva-jyotih is offspring.
7.4.2.31.10	The offspring of the gods are not separated from them. He places the offspring in the seasons.
7.4.2.31.11	Therefore offspring follow the seasons.
7.4.2.31.12	For it is in the seasons that they see the embryo and the born.
7.4.2.32.1	Then he places the Ashadha (brick).
7.4.2.32.2	This is Ashadha.
7.4.2.32.3	He places her here.
7.4.2.32.4	He places it in the eastern half.
7.4.2.32.5	The first one was created.
7.4.2.33.1	She is called Ashadha. The gods and the Asuras, both of whom were born from Prajapati, competed.
7.4.2.33.2	The gods saw this brick called Ashadha,
7.4.2.33.3	and they placed it here.
7.4.2.33.4	Having placed it, they overcame the Asuras, their enemies, their rivals, from all this.
7.4.2.33.5	Because he could not bear it, therefore it is Ashadha.
7.4.2.33.6	In the same way, the sacrificer, having placed this (brick), overcomes his hateful enemy from all this (world).
7.4.2.34.1	When he places the Ashadha brick,
7.4.2.34.2	the Ashadha is speech.
7.4.2.34.3	By means of speech, the gods overcame their enemies, their hateful foes, from all this (universe).
7.4.2.34.4	In the same way, the sacrificer, by means of speech, overcomes his hateful enemy from all sides.
7.4.2.34.5	The gods then placed speech.
7.4.2.34.6	In the same way, this sacrificer places speech.
7.4.2.35.1	This is the one who bears the left.
7.4.2.35.2	The left is the vital airs.
7.4.2.35.3	Whatever is vital, all that it bears.
7.4.2.35.4	Therefore it is the one who carries the left.
7.4.2.36.5	He should not place them in front with another brick having a Yajus formula.
7.4.2.36.6	"So that he does not place the vital airs in this layer."
7.4.2.37.1	When he places five bricks in front,
7.4.2.37.2	water is food.
7.4.2.37.3	The vital airs are not covered by food.
7.4.2.37.4	He places it without covering it with the Rtuviya bricks.
7.4.2.37.5	He establishes speech in the seasons.
7.4.2.37.6	This speech is established in the seasons and speaks.
7.4.2.38.1	They say, "Why does he place the speech of all beings, the light of all beings, between the seasons?"
7.4.2.38.2	The seasons are the year.
7.4.2.38.3	He places speech between the seasons for the sake of beings.
7.4.2.38.4	Therefore beings speak at the time of the year.
7.4.2.39.1	"Thou art the Ashadha, the conqueror."
7.4.2.39.2	For the gods conquered the Asuras with this (verse).
7.4.2.39.3	"Conquer the enemies, conquer the battle-field,"
7.4.2.39.4	(thus) according to the text.
7.4.2.39.5	"Thou art the thousand-fold strength, do thou strengthen me."
7.4.2.39.6	The thousand is all.
7.4.2.39.7	"Thou are the strength of all, do thou strengthen thou me."
7.4.2.39.8	Having placed (the pot), he recites the Sūdadohas (verses).
7.4.2.39.9	His relation has been stated.
7.4.2.40.1	They say, why are the bricks which are to be placed in the fire, placed in the fire?
7.4.2.40.2	One should say, there are two wombs.
7.4.2.40.3	One womb is of the gods, another is of men.
7.4.2.40.4	The gods are born from the east.
7.4.2.40.5	Men are born from the west.
7.4.2.40.6	Now, in that he lays down these (bricks) towards the east, he thereby generates the Sacrificer from the womb of the gods.
7.5.1.1.1	He lays down the tortoise.
7.5.1.1.2	The tortoise is indeed the sap.
7.5.1.1.3	He thus lays down the sap.
7.5.1.1.4	That sap which flowed away from the waters in which these worlds were dissolved, that is this tortoise.
7.5.1.1.5	He thus places it here.
7.5.1.1.6	The Self is as much as the juice.
7.5.1.1.7	This very world is that.
7.5.1.2.1	The lower half of the skull is this world.
7.5.1.2.2	It appears to be established.
7.5.1.2.3	For this world appears to be established
7.5.1.2.4	And the upper half is the sky.
7.5.1.2.5	It appears as if it has a closed end.
7.5.1.2.6	For the sky appears to have a closed end.
7.5.1.2.7	Then what is in between is the atmosphere.
7.5.1.2.8	This is indeed these worlds.
7.5.1.2.9	He places these worlds.
7.5.1.3.1	It he anoints with curds, honey and ghee.
7.5.1.3.2	Curds is indeed the form of this world, ghee of the atmosphere, honey of the other world.
7.5.1.3.3	He thus makes it prosper with its own form.
7.5.1.3.4	Now, indeed, curd is the juice of this world, ghee of the atmosphere, and honey of yonder world.
7.5.1.3.5	He thus nourishes him with his own juice.
7.5.1.4.1	"Honey, O Wind, to the truthful one."
7.5.1.4.2	The deity to which a verse is addressed, and the deity to which a yajus is addressed, is the same. The verse is the deity, and the yajus is the deity.
7.5.1.4.3	This is indeed honey, this is indeed the three-versed.
7.5.1.4.4	Honey is indeed the essence.
7.5.1.4.5	He thus places the essence in it.
7.5.1.4.6	With three Gāyatrī verses.
7.5.1.4.7	Its relation has been explained.
7.5.1.5.1	That which is called Kūrma, having assumed that form, Prajapati created beings.
7.5.1.5.2	What he created, he made.
7.5.1.5.3	Because he made it, it is Kūrma.
7.5.1.5.4	Kasyap is Kūrma.
7.5.1.5.5	Therefore they say, "All creatures are of Kaśyapa."
7.5.1.6.1	That tortoise is the same as the sun.
7.5.1.6.2	He places this sun.
7.5.1.6.3	He puts it in front, facing east.
7.5.1.6.4	He places that sun in front, facing towards the east.
7.5.1.6.5	Therefore that sun is placed in front, facing the east.
7.5.1.6.6-11	To the right, for Ashadha. The bull is the tortoise, the female is Ashadha. The bull lies down to the right of the female. At the distance of a span. For at the distance of a spaṇ the bull lies down to a female. This is the queen of all bricks, namely Ashadha.
7.5.1.6.12	This is the southernmost of all the bricks.
7.5.1.7.1	In that he lays down the tortoise,
7.5.1.7.2	the tortoise is the breath.
7.5.1.7.3	For the breath creates all these creatures.
7.5.1.7.4	He lays down the breath.
7.5.1.7.5	He lays it down facing east.
7.5.1.7.6	He places the breath facing east.
7.5.1.7.7	Therefore, the Prāṇa is placed in front.
7.5.1.7.8	The person is turned towards it.
7.5.1.7.9	He places that Prāṇa in the sacrificer.
7.5.1.7.10	On the right side, for Aṣāḍhā.
7.5.1.7.11	Prāṇa is the tortoise, and Aṣāḍha is speech.
7.5.1.7.12	Prāņa is the bull of speech, Prāṇa is the pair.
7.5.1.8.1	It sinks into the depth of water.
7.5.1.8.2	This is the most profound of all waters, where he shines.
7.5.1.8.3	"May the sun not burn you, may Agni Vaisvānara not burn you."
7.5.1.8.4	"May the Sun not harm you, may Agni Vaiśvānara not harm you." This is what it means.
7.5.1.8.5	"Look upon the unbroken leaves of the creatures."
7.5.1.8.6	These are all the creatures, these are the bricks.
7.5.1.8.7	"May they be without misfortune, without distress, may you look upon them."
7.5.1.8.8	"May the heavenly rain follow you."
7.5.1.8.9	It means, "May the heavenly rain fall upon you."
7.5.1.9.1	He then stretches him, saying, "He has entered the three oceans, the heavenly ones."
7.5.1.9.2	These are the three oceans, namely, the heavenly worlds.
7.5.1.9.3	He follows them in the form of a tortoise.
7.5.1.9.4	"The lord of waters, the bull of bricks."
7.5.1.9.5	For he is indeed the lord of waters, and the bull of bricks.
7.5.1.9.6	"Dressed in excrement, the world of the righteous."
7.5.1.9.7	Excrement indeed is cattle.
7.5.1.9.8	"Dresses in cattle, the world of righteousness."
7.5.1.9.9	"Go there where the ancestors have gone before."
7.5.1.9.10	Go there where these (gods) have performed their former rites."
7.5.1.10.1	"The great heaven and earth are not."
7.5.1.10.2	"The heaven and earth are great."
7.5.1.10.3	"They have mixed this sacrifice."
7.5.1.10.4	"They protect this sacrifice."
7.5.1.10.5	They have helped us with burdens.
7.5.1.10.6	"May they bear us with their burdens." This is what it means.
7.5.1.10.7	He places the Dyava-pṛthivya bricks on the top.
7.5.1.10.8	For the tortoise is the Dyava-Pṛthivya.
7.5.1.11.1	He places them with three (bricks).
7.5.1.11.2	These are the three worlds.
7.5.1.11.3	And Agni is threefold.
7.5.1.11.4	He places him with as much as Agni is, as much as is his measure.
7.5.1.11.5	He anoints with three (kinds of) butter.
7.5.1.11.6	That makes six.
7.5.1.11.7	Its relation has been explained.
7.5.1.11.8	Avakas are below, Avakas are above.
7.5.1.11.9	Avakas indeed are water.
7.5.1.11.10	He thus places him in the middle of water.
7.5.1.11.11	Having settled (the Avakas), he recites the Sūdadohas-formula.
7.5.1.11.12	Its relation is explained.
7.5.1.12.1	Then he places the mortar and pestle.
7.5.1.12.2	Viṣṇu desired, "May I be the giver of food."
7.5.1.12.3	He saw these bricks in the form of a mortar and pestle.
7.5.1.12.4	He placed them.
7.5.1.12.5	By placing them, he became the giver of food.
7.5.1.12.6	In the same way, the sacrificer places the mortar and pestle, thinking, "By performing that act in that form, Viṣṇu became the giver of nourishment. By performing that act in the same form, may I become the giver of nourishment."
7.5.1.12.7	All this is food, namely the mortar and pestle.
7.5.1.12.8	For it is by means of the mortar and pestles that food is made.
7.5.1.12.9	It is by means of mortar and pestle that food is ground.
7.5.1.13.1	He places them on the Vala of the semen-seed.
7.5.1.13.2	The semen-seed are the backbones.
7.5.1.13.3	The backbones are the middle.
7.5.1.13.4	He places this food in the middle of him.
7.5.1.13.5	On the northern side.
7.5.1.14.5	What is more, it destroys.
7.5.1.14.6	What is less, that does not protect.
7.5.1.15.1	They are of Udumbara wood.
7.5.1.15.2	Udumbara is energy and sap.
7.5.1.15.3	He thus places energy and sap in it.
7.5.1.15.4	And moreover, all these are trees, namely the Udumbara.
7.5.1.15.5	When he places them, he places all trees.
7.5.1.15.6	By the means of the seed-sowing.
7.5.1.15.7-14	These two are the seed-sowers. He places the trees on them. Therefore, there are trees on them. The four-cornered (altar) is for the four directions. There are four directions. He places trees in all directions. Therefore, trees are in all directions. The middle is enclosed for the shape of a mortar.
7.5.1.16.1	The reason why the pestle and mortar are placed (in the fire) is this.
7.5.1.16.2	From the relaxed Prajapati, the vital air moved towards the middle.
7.5.1.16.3	He caught it with food.
7.5.1.16.4	Therefore the vital air is caught with food.
7.5.1.16.5	For he who eats food, breathes.
7.5.1.17.1	When the vital air was caught, food moved from it.
7.5.1.17.2	He grasped it with Prāṇa.
7.5.1.17.3	Therefore, food is grasped with Prāṇa
7.5.1.17.4	He who breathes eats food.
7.5.1.18.1	From these two grasped ones, energy began to move.
7.5.1.18.2	He grasped it with both of them.
7.5.1.18.3	Therefore, energy is grasped with both of them.
7.5.1.20.2	Having taken them one from the other, he gave them to himself.
7.5.1.20.3	All the gods approached this food as it was being offered.
7.5.1.20.4	For all this is sustained by food.
7.5.1.21.1	This verse was uttered about it: "That indeed became the vital breath."
7.5.1.21.2	That indeed became the breath.
7.5.1.21.3	Having become great, Prajapati.
7.5.1.21.4-11	For it was a great thing that these gods did when they approached him. "Bhuja, Bhujisha, Vitti." The breath is Bhuja. Food is Bhujisha. All this is Vitti. When he breathed the breath, he became the Puris. The Self is the Puris. When he breathed the breath into the Puris, he became the gods.
7.5.1.21.12	Now, when Prajapati breathed, therefore Prajapati is the breath.
7.5.1.21.13	That which is the breath, that is the Gayatri.
7.5.1.21.14	That which was the food, that is Vishnu, the deity.
7.5.1.21.15	That which the arg, that is the Udumbara.
7.5.1.22.1	He said, "This indeed has freed me from all sin."
7.5.1.22.2	What he said, "You have raised me up," therefore it is the Udumbara.
7.5.1.22.3	They call the Udumbara tree the Udumbara, indirectly.
7.5.1.22.4	The gods desire the indirect.
7.5.1.22.5	"You have made me large," he said.
7.5.1.22.6	Therefore it is the Urukara.
7.5.1.22.7	They call a pestle the Urukara, indirectly.
7.5.1.22.8	Gods desire the indirect.
7.5.1.24.1	Where the gods placed him together, there they placed all this in his middle, the breath, food, and energy.
7.5.1.24.2	In the same way, he places this in him.
7.5.1.24.3	By the flow of semen and blood.
7.5.1.24.4	The back is the flow of semen.
7.5.1.24.5	The middle is the back.
7.5.1.24.6	In the middle, he places all this in him.
7.5.1.25.1	"He sees the deeds of Vishnu."
7.5.1.25.2	The deeds of Vishnu are indeed strength.
7.5.1.25.3	This means "he sees the strengths."
7.5.1.25.4	"He sees the vows from which."
7.5.1.25.5	The vow is indeed food.
7.5.1.25.6	This means, "he made the food visible."
7.5.1.25.7	"He is the friend of Indra, the yoke."
7.5.1.25.8	For he is indeed the yoke-friend of Indra.
7.5.1.25.9	He places the two-deity bricks.
7.5.1.25.10	There are two pestles and mortars.
7.5.1.25.11	He places them down together.
7.5.1.25.12	He makes them equal.
7.5.1.25.13	For this food is equal.
7.5.1.25.14	Having placed them down, he says to the Sudha and Doha, "Give!"
7.5.1.25.15	Its relation has been explained.
7.5.1.26.1	Then he places down the cauldron.
7.5.1.26.2	The cauldron is the womb.
7.5.1.26.3	He places down the womb.
7.5.1.26.4	It is placed down on the pestle.
7.5.1.26.5	The sky is the mortar.
7.5.1.26.6	Whatever is above it is the sky.
7.5.1.26.7	The sky is the middle.
7.5.1.26.8	He places the womb in the middle.
7.5.1.26.9	Therefore the womb of all beings is in the middle, even of the trees.
7.5.1.27.1	What is the reason for placing the mortar?
7.5.1.27.2	That which was Prajapati who fell down, that is the mortar.
7.5.1.27.3	These worlds are the cauldrons.
7.5.1.27.4	These worlds are Prajapati.
7.5.1.27.5	He places it on the mortar.
7.5.1.27.6	He thus establishes him in this entire (world), in the breath, in food, in energy.
7.5.1.27.7	And thus he places him in this entire world, not hidden.
7.5.1.28.1	Then having ground the Upashaya, and having made a pan for the Lokabhaga, he places it in front of the pan.
7.5.1.28.2	This indeed is his world.
7.5.1.28.3	Thus indeed it becomes uninterrupted for him.
7.5.1.29.1	They say, how does this become cooked and baked for him?
7.5.1.29.2	By the very Yajus-formulated (mantra).
7.5.1.29.3	Now, whatever food one offers to the fire Agni Vaiśvānara, it becomes cooked, prepared, and ready from that itself.
7.5.1.30.1	"You are firm, the firm one."
7.5.1.30.2	Its relation has been explained.
7.5.1.30.3	"He was born here first from these sources, the knower of beings."
7.5.1.30.4	For it was from these sources that the knower of the beings was born first.
7.5.1.30.5	May he carry the oblation to the gods, knowing, with the Gayatri, the Tristubh and the Anustubh.
7.5.1.30.6	He carries the oblation to these gods with these metres, knowing.
7.5.1.31.1	"May you delight in food, in wealth, in strength, in splendour, in offspring."
7.5.1.31.2	"May you be pleased with all this."
7.5.1.31.3	"You are the overlord, you are the self-lord."
7.5.1.31.4	And he is the emperor and the sovereign.
7.5.1.31.5	And these two are the Sarasvatis, the two rivers.
7.5.1.31.6	Mind indeed is Sarasvat.
7.5.1.31.7	Speech is Sarasvati.
7.5.1.31.8	These two are the Sarasvati rivers.
7.5.1.31.9	They have brought you here. That is what it means.
7.5.1.31.10	He places them with two (verses).
7.5.1.31.11	The significance of this has been explained.
7.5.1.31.12	And this is indeed a twofold form, namely clay and water.
7.5.1.31.13	Having placed it, he recites the Sūda and Doha verses.
7.5.1.31.14	His relationship has been explained.
7.5.1.32.1	Then he offers it with the formula, "To the one who is born, to the one who is unborn, to the one whose birth is not known, to the one born from the womb, to the one without a womb, to the unborn, to the unborn one, to the one with a womb, to Agni, to the one in the womb, to Agni."
7.5.1.32.2	This is the semen that was previously deposited in her, the sand.
7.5.1.32.3	He makes it grow.
7.5.1.32.4	Therefore, semen deposited in the womb grows.
7.5.1.32.5	He offers with clarified butter, with the ladle, with the word "svāhā", with two verses addressed to Agni, in the Gāyatrī metre.
7.5.1.32.6	Its relation has been stated.
7.5.1.33.1	"O Agni, do thou yoke those who are thine, do thou yoke the invoked gods."
7.5.1.33.2	With the verses containing the word "yuktavatī".
7.5.1.33.3	Herein he unites the semen in the womb.
7.5.1.33.4	Therefore semen united in the womb does not come out.
7.5.1.34.1	If he is to be paid for a year, then he should offer the oblation.
7.5.1.34.2	The entire year is what is to be paid.
7.5.1.34.3	The entire oblation is what is to offered.
7.5.1.34.4	If he is not to be paid for the year, then he may stand near.
7.5.1.34.5	What is not to be given for the year is not the entire year.
7.5.1.34.6	What is stood near is not the entire oblation.
7.5.1.34.7	One should offer the oblations.
7.5.1.35.1	This Agni is the animal.
7.5.1.35.2	He is completely and entirely made here.
7.5.1.35.3	His lower breath is the naturally-perforated, the two Yajus are the hips, the two semen-dripping are the flanks, the all-light is the neck, the truth-knowing is the throat, the Ashada is the head, the tortoise is the head.
7.5.1.35.4	The breaths that are in the tortoise, the breaths that are in its head, those are these.
7.5.1.37.3	Therefore this sun moves over these worlds.
7.5.1.38.1	The cauldron is the belly.
7.5.1.38.2	The mortar is the womb.
7.5.1.38.3	The upper cauldron is placed below the mortar.
7.5.1.38.4	For the belly is above, the womb below.
7.5.1.38.5	The pestle is the penis.
7.5.1.38.6	It is made round.
7.5.1.38.7	For the penis is round.
7.5.1.38.8-13	He places it on the right side. For the male approaches the female from the right side. The food of the animal which has been sanctified is the Dūrvā-bricks. Of this one, the northern half is more raised. The animal is Agni. Therefore, the northern side of the well-fed animal is more raised.
7.5.2.3.3	Now those five fires are the five layers.
7.5.2.3.4	And those five layers are these worlds.
7.5.2.3.5	And those worlds are the cauldron.
7.5.2.3.6	And when he puts the heads of the animals in the cauldron, he thus joins those fires with those heads.
7.5.2.4.1	He puts them down in front, facing west.
7.5.2.4.2	Now when Prajapati wanted to take these animals, they tried to escape.
7.5.2.4.3	He caught them in the vital airs.
7.5.2.4.4	Having caught them in the vitals, he placed them in front of himself, facing west.
7.5.2.5.1	This is what the gods did.
7.5.2.5.2	Now these animals do not escape from him.
7.5.2.5.3	"What the gods did, that I do."
7.5.2.5.4	And verily, having thus taken them in the vital airs, he places them in front, facing west, in the self.
7.5.2.6.1	And why he places the heads of the animals,
7.5.2.6.2	Prajapati was here at first, alone.
7.5.2.6.3	He desired: "May I create food, may I beget offspring."
7.5.2.6.4	He created the animals from the vital airs, the man from the mind, the horse from the eye, the cow from the breath, the sheep from the ear, and the goat from speech.
7.5.2.6.5	Because he created them from the vital airs he is called 'the vital airs are the animals'.
7.5.2.6.6	The mind is the first of the vital airs.
7.5.2.6.7	Now, because he created the man from the mind, therefore they say, "The man is the most vigorous of animals."
7.5.2.6.8	The mind is all the vital airs.
7.5.2.6.9	For all the vital airs are established in the mind.
7.5.2.6.10	Now, because he created a man from the mind. Therefore they say, "Man is all animals."
7.5.2.6.11	For all these are of the man.
7.5.2.7.1	Having created this food, he placed it in front of himself.
7.5.2.7.2	Therefore, whoever creates food places it in front of oneself.
7.5.2.7.3	That is in the pot.
7.5.2.7.4	The pot is the belly.
7.5.2.7.5	He places that food in the belly.
7.5.2.8.1	Then he places the pieces of gold on them.
7.5.2.8.2	Gold is indeed life.
7.5.2.8.3	Or else, when these animals are being killed, the vital airs depart from them.
7.5.2.8.4	When he puts the pieces of gold on them, he puts the vital airs into them.
7.5.2.9.1	He puts seven (pieces).
7.5.2.9.2	There are seven vital airs in the head.
7.5.2.9.3	He puts them into him.
7.5.2.9.4	If there are five animals, he should put seven pieces on each of the five.
7.5.2.9.5	He places five animals.
7.5.2.9.6	Seven are the breaths in each animal.
7.5.2.9.7	He places all the breaths in them.
7.5.2.10.1	Some, even if there is only one animal, place five and then seven by seven.
7.5.2.10.2	He places five animals. 
7.5.2.10.3	Seven are the breath in each animal.
7.5.2.10.4	"Let me give life to all of them."
7.5.2.10.5	One should not do so.
7.5.2.10.6	In this animal, the form of all animals is present.
7.5.2.10.7	When one places it in this animal, one gives life to all of these.
7.5.2.11.1	One places it first in the mouth, saying, "The rivers flow properly like the Dhenas."
7.5.2.11.2	Dhenas are food.
7.5.2.11.3	This is indeed the right mouth to pour into.
7.5.2.11.4	"It is purified by the inner heart and mind."
7.5.2.11.5	"The food is purified by the true inner heart and mind, by the one who is upright."
7.5.2.11.6	"I see the stream of ghee."
7.5.2.11.7	"He says this to the oblations that he is about to offer in this fire."
7.5.2.11.8	"The golden palm tree in the middle of the fire."
7.5.2.11.9	He who is this golden man, to him this is said.
7.5.2.12.1	"To the Rk here."
7.5.2.12.2	The breath is the Rk.
7.5.2.12.3	For by the breath one worships.
7.5.2.12.4	"To radiance here."
7.5.2.12.5	The radiance is the breath.
7.5.2.12.6	For by breath one shines.
7.5.2.12.7	And for the breath this whole shines.
7.5.2.12.8	"To light here."
7.5.2.12.9	"To the light here."
7.5.2.12.10	The eyes are luminous and shining.
7.5.2.12.11	This is the strength of the world, the universe, of Agni Vaiśvānara.
7.5.2.12.12	Agni is luminous with light, shining with splendor.
7.5.2.12.13	With the two verses beginning with "Viśvavati."
7.5.2.12.14	For the ear is universal.
7.5.2.13.1	Then he takes up the human head.
7.5.2.13.2	He thus makes it grow.
7.5.2.13.3	"He says, "Thou art the giver of a thousand, for a thousand to thee."
7.5.2.13.4	A thousand means everything.
7.5.2.13.5	Thou art the giver to everything.
7.5.2.13.6	This means, 'For everything to thee.'
7.5.2.14.1	He places them thus: first the man, then the man, having obtained the man by means of his strength, he places him in the middle, and the other animals around.
7.5.2.16.2	In this direction he places these two animals.
7.5.2.16.3	Therefore in this direction these two animals are the most numerous.
7.5.2.17.1	He places the man on the milk.
7.5.2.17.2	Milk is cattle.
7.5.2.17.3	He thus establishes the sacrificer among the cattle.
7.5.2.17.4	"He places him with the milk, the embryo, the sun."
7.5.2.17.5	The man is indeed the embryo of the sun.
7.5.2.17.6	Having mixed it with milk, one should recite this:
7.5.2.17.7	"The thousand-fold image of the universe, the form of the thousand."
7.5.2.17.8	The thousand-fold form is indeed the man.
7.5.2.17.9	For the thousand belongs to the man.
7.5.2.17.10	"Protect me with your radiance, do not harm me."
7.5.2.17.11	This means, "Surround me with your radiance and do not harm me with it."
7.5.2.17.12	"Make me live for a hundred years, while I am being worshipped."
7.5.2.18.7	The horse is born in the waters.
7.5.2.18.8	"The golden child of the rivers, the one who is in the mountain, the one who has the mountain as his abode."
7.5.2.18.9	The mountain is the mountain.
7.5.2.18.10	The waters have the mountain as their abode.
7.5.2.18.11	"O Agni, do not injure me in the highest heaven."
7.5.2.18.12	These worlds are the highest heaven.
7.5.2.18.13	"Do not injure him in these worlds." This is what is meant.
7.5.2.19.1	Then to the right, the cow, the ever-flowing, the red, the moon.
7.5.2.19.2	Soma is the moon.
7.5.2.19.3	That cow is indeed the ever-flowing Soma.
7.5.2.19.4	The bull.
7.5.2.19.5	This means the husband.
7.5.2.19.6	I praise Agni, the ancient-minded, with salutations.
7.5.2.19.7	The cow is indeed connected with Agni.
7.5.2.19.8	The ancient-minded.
7.5.2.19.9	For they carry Agni forward.
7.5.2.19.10	They attend to him as he goes forward.
7.5.2.19.11	He is fashioned by the seasons in the form of the joints.
7.5.2.19.12	When he is built, he is fashioned by the joints in the form of seasons.
7.5.2.19.13	"Do not injure the cow, Aditi, Viraj."
7.5.2.19.14	The cow is Viraj.
7.5.2.19.15	Viraj is food.
7.5.2.19.16	The cow is food.
7.5.2.20.1	Then (he recites) the verse, "Varuni and Tvashtri's Varuni, Varuna's navel."
7.5.2.20.2	Varuni and Tvastri are the same as Avi.
7.5.2.20.3	"Avi was born from the highest realm of the sky."
7.5.2.20.4	The highest realm is the ear.
7.5.2.20.5	The highest realm of the ear is the directions.
7.5.2.20.6	"The earth with a thousand (cows), the Asura's illusion."
7.5.2.20.7	The great Sahasri is the illusion of the Asura. This is what it means.
7.5.2.20.8	"O Agni, do not injure in the supreme sky."
7.5.2.20.9	These worlds are the supreme sky.
7.5.2.20.10	"Do not injure him in these worlds." This is what it is said.
7.5.2.21.1	Then on the right side, "O Agni, he who was born from Agni,"
7.5.2.21.2	Agni was born from Agni through grief.
7.5.2.21.3	"He is the one who is on the earth and in heaven."
7.5.2.21.4	What was born from the grief of Prajapati was born from the sorrow of heaven and earth.
7.5.2.21.5	"By whom the Creator created all beings."
7.5.2.21.6	The goat is speech.
7.5.2.21.7	The Creator created all beings by speech.
7.5.2.25.3	Having removed this skull from the head, he places in it the strength that is within the head.
7.5.2.26.1	Then having recited the second half of the verse, he offers the oblation with the word "svāhā".
7.5.2.26.2	Having placed this skull on the head, he puts in it the strength which is above the head.
7.5.2.27.1	The variegated army of the gods has risen up."
7.5.2.27.2	This is the sun, this is the man.
7.5.2.27.3	This is the variegated army of the gods rising up.
7.5.2.27.4	The eye of Mitra, Varuna, and Agni.
7.5.2.27.5	This is indeed the eye of both the gods and men.
7.5.2.27.6	The sky, the earth, and the atmosphere.
7.5.2.27.7	Rising up, he fills these worlds.
7.5.2.27.8	The sun is the Self of the world and of the standing.
7.5.2.27.9	For this is the Self of all this, both that which moves and that which stands.
7.5.2.28.1	Then he attends with the offerings.
7.5.2.28.2	This is where Prajapati pursued these animals, and they, being pursued, lamented.
7.5.2.28.3	He removed their grief and sin with these offerings.
7.5.2.28.4	In the same way, he removes the impurity and sin of these (animals) by means of these offerings.
7.5.2.29.1	Some people, when they place any animal, release its impurity, thinking, "We should not place the impurity and sin."
7.5.2.29.2	They place the impurity and the sin.
7.5.2.29.3	For the northern one releases the purity that the eastern one has let go.
7.5.2.30.1	Some people stand in the opposite direction, saying, "We are releasing the purity upwards."
7.5.2.30.2	They are indeed approaching the sin of purity.
7.5.2.30.3	For this rite leads one upwards.
7.5.2.30.4	They release the purity upwards.
7.5.2.31.1	One should release the fire with the external (fire).
7.5.2.31.2	These are the worlds, this is Agni.
7.5.2.31.3	He places the purity outside these worlds.
7.5.2.31.4	Outside the altar.
7.5.2.31.5	This is the altar.
7.5.2.31.6	He places purity outside it.
7.5.2.31.7	Standing towards the north.
7.5.2.31.8	The animals are in this direction.
7.5.2.31.9	He places that purity in those animals.
7.5.2.32.1	First he lays down the Purusha.
7.5.2.32.2	For he is the first one to be laid down. He says, "Do not injure the two-footed animal."
7.5.2.32.3	For the Purusha is a two-footed animal.
7.5.2.32.4	"Do not injure him" is what he means.
7.5.2.32.5	"May he be worshipped for wisdom, the thousand-eyed one."
7.5.2.32.6	For the thousand-eyed is the golden piece.
7.5.2.32.7	"For wisdom" means "for food."
7.5.2.32.8	"O Agni, accept the animal, the sacrifice, the oblation."
7.5.2.32.9	The animal is the Kimpurusha.
7.5.2.32.10	"Accept the Kimpurusha, O Agni," is what is meant.
7.5.2.32.11	"One who is making the offering, may he sit down on his body."
7.5.2.32.12	The body is the self.
7.5.2.32.13	"One making the offering, do thou purify the self," is what is intended.
7.5.2.32.14	May the curse reach the animal.
7.5.2.32.15	"May the curse reach him whom we hate."
7.5.2.32.16	He places the curse on the one he hates and on the one he loves.
7.5.2.33.1	"Do not injure this horse, the one-hoofed animal."
7.5.2.33.2	The horse is the one-hoorned animal among animals.
7.5.2.33.3	"Do no injury to it." That is what it means.
7.5.2.33.4	"The neighing steed among the steeds."
7.5.2.33.5	This is the cry of the horse, the horse among horses.
7.5.2.33.6	I direct you to the wild bull.
7.5.2.33.7	He directs him to the wild bull,
7.5.2.33.8	while he is building, he sits down on his body.
7.5.2.33.9	While he is building, make yourself pure.
7.5.2.33.10	May the curse reach the one we hate. May the curse reach the person we hate.
7.5.2.34.5	"Pouring out ghee for the people, for Aditi."
7.5.2.34.6	Aditi indeed pours out ghee for the peoples.
7.5.2.34.7	"Do not injure me, O Agni, in the highest heaven."
7.5.2.34.8	These worlds are the highest heaven.
7.5.2.34.9	"Do no injury to him in these worlds," is what is meant.
7.5.2.34.10	"I direct you to the wild gavaya."
7.5.2.34.11	He directs him to the wild gavya.
7.5.2.34.12	"He who is weaving his body, may he sit down."
7.5.2.34.13	"He who is weaving, may he purify himself." This is what it means.
7.5.2.34.14	"May the curse reach the one you hate; may the curse reach the person you hate."
7.5.2.34.15	He places the curse on the one he hates and on the one he dislikes.
7.5.2.35.1	"Then the goat with the wool."
7.5.2.35.2	This means "with a garland of wool."
7.5.2.35.3-8	The navel of Varuna. For the cow is indeed of Varuna.  The skin of animals, of bipeds and quadrupeds. For this is the skin of all animals, of biped and quadrupeds,  The first womb of creatures of Tvashtra. This is the first form which Tvashtra created.
7.5.2.35.9	"O Agni, do not injure me in the highest heaven."
7.5.2.35.10	These worlds are the highest heaven.
7.5.2.35.11	He means to say, "Do not injure him in these worlds."
7.5.2.35.12	"I direct you to the wild camel."
7.5.2.35.13	He directs him to the wild camel.
7.5.2.35.14	"While building, he sits down on his body."
7.5.2.35.15	And by that one, one should purify oneself. This is what it means.
7.5.2.35.16	May the curse reach the camel that we hate, may the curse reach him whom we hate."
7.5.2.35.17	He places the curse on the camel and on the one he hates.
7.5.2.36.1	Then (he says), "The goat was born from Agni out of grief."
7.5.2.36.2	What was born from the grief of Prajapati, that was born from the sorrow of Agni.
7.5.2.36.3	He saw his father in front.
7.5.2.36.4	Prajapati is the father.
7.5.2.36.5	He saw Prajapati in front. That is what it means.
7.5.2.36.6	With that, the gods went to the deity in front.
7.5.2.36.7	The goat is speech.
7.5.2.36.8	The gods went to the divine speech in front with that.
7.5.2.36.9	He goes to the heaven, to the heaven of the gods.
7.5.2.36.10	The heaven is the heaven of the god.
7.5.2.36.11	He goes to the heaven of gods.
7.5.2.36.12	I direct you to the wild deer.
7.5.2.36.13	He directs him to the wild deer,
7.5.2.36.14	He who is building, sits down to his body.
7.5.2.36.15	He who is constructing, may you purify yourself.
7.5.2.36.16	May the curse reach the one we hate. May the curse reach him whom we hate.
7.5.2.36.17	He places the curse on the one he hates and on the one he loves.
7.5.2.37.1	They say, "That which Prajapati removed from these animals was their sin.
7.5.2.37.2	Those who have fallen away from the Veda, who are not learned in the Veda, who do not know the sacrifice,
7.5.2.37.3	a Brāhmaṇa should not eat with them.
7.5.2.37.4	He places them in this direction.
7.5.2.37.5	Therefore in this direction Parjanya does not rain, where they are.
7.5.2.38.1	Having returned, he approaches the fire.
7.5.2.38.2	This is what he does wrongly, when he goes outside the sacrificial enclosure to the fire that has been kindled for the Sāman-chanting.
7.5.2.38.3	Therefore, he makes it known for non-injury.
7.5.2.38.4	With the Agniyesti verse.
7.5.2.38.5	He makes it known to Agni himself.
7.5.2.38.6	With the Gāyatrī metre.
7.5.2.38.7	Agni is Gāyatrī.
7.5.2.38.8	He makes known to him as much as Agni is and as much as is his measure.
7.5.2.38.9	With the Anirukta verse.
7.5.2.38.10	The Anirukta is everything.
7.5.2.38.11	All of them are indeed praising him.
7.5.2.38.12	With the Yavistava.
7.5.2.38.13	This is his beloved abode, that he is the most youthful.
7.5.2.38.14	For when he was born, everything became youthful. Therefore, he is the most youthfull.
7.5.2.39.1	You are the most youthful to the worshipper.
7.5.2.39.2	The worshipper is indeed the one who worships.
7.5.2.39.3	Protect the men.
7.5.2.39.4	Men are indeed men.
7.5.2.39.5	Listen to this song.
7.5.2.39.6	Listen to this praise. This is what it means.
7.5.2.39.7	"Protect the offspring and oneself."
7.5.2.39.8	Offspring means progeny.
7.5.2.39.9	This means, "Protect the progeny and oneself."
7.5.2.40.1	Having ascended the fire with one's back, and having approached the self-born ones, one places the Apasyas.
7.5.2.40.2	These are the waters, namely the Apasyas
7.5.2.40.3	Or else, the waters have emerged from these animals.
7.5.2.40.4	When he places the Apasyā bricks, he places water in these animals.
7.5.2.40.5	He places them without leaving a space between them and the animals.
7.5.2.40.6	He thus places water in the animals without leaving a space.
7.5.2.40.7	He places five five bricks.
7.5.2.40.8	These are the five animals.
7.5.2.40.9	He puts them down all around.
7.5.2.40.10	He thus puts water in them all around.
7.5.2.41.1	Those fifteen are the waters.
7.5.2.41.2	The waters are the thunderbolt.
7.5.2.41.3	The thunderbolt is fifteen.
7.5.2.41.4	Therefore, wherever the waters go, they destroy sin there.
7.5.2.41.5	The thunderbolt indeed destroys the sin of half of that.
7.5.2.41.6	Therefore, one should go to a village without an umbrella when it rains.
7.5.2.41.7	"This thunderbolt has destroyed my sin."
7.5.2.42.1	Now those five extra ones are the Chhandasya bricks.
7.5.2.42.2	The Chhandasya are cattle.
7.5.2.42.3	Cattle are food.
7.5.2.42.4	Food is the flesh of cattle.
7.5.2.42.5	And indeed from these cattle the flesh has gone out.
7.5.2.42.6	And in that he lays down the Chhandas bricks, he places the flesh in these cattle.
7.5.2.42.7	He places the animals without any intervening space.
7.5.2.42.8	He thus places the flesh of the animals without any space between them.
7.5.2.42.9	The Apasya (waters) are within, the Chandyas (waters) are outside.
7.5.2.42.10	For the waters are within, the flesh is outside.
7.5.2.43.1	They say, "These are the waters, these are the flesh, but where is the skin, where are the hairs?"
7.5.2.43.2	The skin of the animal is indeed food.
7.5.2.43.3	The hair is food.
7.5.2.43.4	The animal's skin is that which he places on the fire-pan. The hair is that which is on the fire-pans.
7.5.2.43.5	And the hair is that which are the sheep's hairs on the fire-pans.
7.5.2.43.6	The fire-pan is outside, the animal's heads inside.
7.5.2.43.7	For the hair is outside, the body inside.
7.5.2.43.8	"If with one, if with another," so says Sandilya.
7.5.2.43.9	We all together, all of us, are performing the sacrifice.
7.5.2.44.1	Whatever water he places,
7.5.2.44.2	from the scattered Prajapati the waters flowed.
7.5.2.44.3	They flowed into them.
7.5.2.44.4	Because they flowed, there are twenty.
7.5.2.44.5	They flowed from her fingers.
7.5.2.44.6	The fingers are the end.
7.5.2.44.7	From the end of him the waters flowed.
7.5.2.45.1	He who is this Prajapati, when he was falling down, he is the same Agni who is being piled up here.
7.5.2.45.2	And those waters which flowed from him, they are these waters.
7.5.2.45.3	When he puts these (bricks) here, he puts back in him those waters which flowed away from him.
7.5.2.45.4	Therefore he puts these here.
7.5.2.46.1	"He puts them down with the formula, 'I settle thee in the waters."
7.5.2.52.3	The gods dug out the three Vedas from the ocean of the mind with the sharp spade of speech.
7.5.2.52.4	This verse was uttered: "The gods who dug out the oceans with sharp spades, may the good god know today where they placed the offering."
7.5.2.52.5	The mind is the ocean.
7.5.2.52.6	Speech is the sharp spade.
7.5.2.52.7	The three Vedas are the offering.
7.5.2.52.8	This is the verse that is recited.
7.5.2.52.9	He places it in the mind, saying, "I place you in the mind."
7.5.2.53.1	"I place you in your abode in the body."
7.5.2.53.2	The body is indeed the abode of speech.
7.5.2.53.3	He places her in speech, saying, "In the abode of speech."
7.5.2.54.1	"I am placing you in the abode of water."
7.5.2.54.2	The abode of water is the eye.
7.5.2.54.3	For it is there that all the waters are always consumed.
7.5.2.54.4	He places them in the eye,
7.5.2.55.1	"I place you in the seat of the waters."
7.5.2.55.2	The seat of the waters is the ear.
7.5.2.55.3	He places it in the ear.
7.5.2.55.4	Those waters which have come from these forms, he places them here.
7.5.2.55.5	And he places these forms in it.
7.5.2.56.1	"I place you in your seat."
7.5.2.56.2	The seat is the sky.
7.5.2.56.3	The waters are indeed collected in heaven.
7.5.2.56.4	He places her in heaven.
7.5.2.57.1	"He says, "I place you in the abode of the waters."
7.5.2.57.2	The abode of the waters is indeed the atmosphere.
7.5.2.57.3	He places it in the atmosphere.
7.5.2.58.1	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, "I am placing you in the womb of the waters.",
7.5.2.58.2	The womb of the waters is the ocean.
7.5.2.58.3	He places them in the ocean.
7.5.2.59.1	"He places them in their own place, saying, "I am putting you in the excrement of the waters."
7.5.2.61.1-6	I settle you with the Gayatri metre. I settle you with the Trishtup metre. Isettle you with the Jagati metre. I settles you with the Anushtup metre. I settle you with Paṅkti metre. He settles it with the metres which have come to him from these metres.
7.5.2.62.8	The five fingers of each hand are five.
7.5.2.62.9	He lays them down separately.
7.5.2.62.10	The fingers are separate.
7.5.2.62.11	He lays down each one at a time.
7.5.2.62.12	He makes them uniform.
7.5.2.62.13	Therefore they are connected uniformly.
8.1.1.1.1	He lays the Prāṇabhṛt bricks.
8.1.1.1.2	The Prāṇabhāṛts are the vital airs.
8.1.1.1.3	He lays these vital airs.
8.1.1.1.4	They are laid down in the first layer.
8.1.1.1.5	The first half of Agni is the first layer.
8.1.1.1.6	He places the vital airs in front.
8.1.1.1.7	Therefore, these vital airs are in front.
8.1.1.2.1	He places them in groups of ten.
8.1.1.2.2	There are ten vital airs.
8.1.1.2.3	If one were to do it many times, it would be ten times ten.
8.1.1.2.4	He places in groups of ten three times.
8.1.1.2.5	He places five animals.
8.1.1.2.6	There are ten, ten breaths in each animal.
8.1.1.2.7	He places all the breaths in them.
8.1.1.2.8	He places them without leaving a gap from the animals.
8.1.1.2.9	He places the breaths in the animals without leaving a gap.
8.1.1.2.10	He places (the animals) everywhere.
8.1.1.2.11	He places breaths everywhere in them.
8.1.1.3.1	Now, when he places the Prāṇabhṛt bricks,
8.1.1.3.2	the vital airs of Prajapati, having become deities, escaped from him.
8.1.1.3.3	He said to them, "Come to me."
8.1.1.3.4	"You have escaped from me by that which is mine."
8.1.1.3.5	"Do you create that food by which we may see you and approach you."
8.1.1.3.6	"We shall both create it."
8.1.1.3.7	"So be it."
8.1.1.3.8	Those vital airs and Prajapati created this food, these creatures that sustain the vital airs.
8.1.1.4.1	He places it in front, saying, "This is the front, the Bhuva."
8.1.1.4.2	For Agni is in front, and when he says "front,"
8.1.1.4.3	they raise Agni facing east,
8.1.1.4.4	and they attend him facing east.
8.1.1.4.5	And when he says "Bhuva,"
8.1.1.4.6	Agni is the Bhuva.
8.1.1.4.7	For Agni is all this.
8.1.1.4.8	Indeed, Agni, having become the breath, stood in front.
8.1.1.4.9	He places that very form.
8.1.1.5.1	His form is Prāṇabhāvayana.
8.1.1.5.2	He created the breath from that form of Agni.
8.1.1.5.3	Spring is Prāṇāyana.
8.1.1.5.4	He created breaths in the spring season.
8.1.1.5.5	The Gāyatrī is the spring.
8.1.1.5.6	He created the Gayatri metre from the spring season.
8.1.1.5.7	"The Gayatri metre is the Gayatri."
8.1.1.5.8	He created the Gayatri Saman from the Gayatri metre.
8.1.1.5.9	"The Upamsu is from the Gayatri." (Saman).
8.1.1.5.10	He created the Upamsu Graha from the Gayatri Samana.
8.1.1.5.11	"The Trivrit is from the Upamsu."
8.1.1.5.12	From the Graha called Upamsu, he fashioned the Stoma consisting of three verses.
8.1.1.5.13	"The Rathantara is three-versed."
8.1.1.5.14	From the Stoma consisting three verses, he fashioned the Rathantara as the Prastara.
8.1.1.6.1	"The sage Vasishtha."
8.1.1.6.2	The sage Vasishth is the breath.
8.1.1.6.3	He is called Vasishtha because he is the best.
8.1.1.6.4	Or because he dwells in the best, therefore he is called Vasishth.
8.1.1.6.5	"You have taken it with Prajapati."
8.1.1.6.6	This means "You have created it with Prajapata."
8.1.1.6.7	"I take the breath for the creatures."
8.1.1.6.8	He places the breath in front.
8.1.1.6.9	He places it in different ways.
8.1.1.6.10	Those who have different desires in the breath, he places them there.
8.1.1.6.11	He settles it once.
8.1.1.6.12	He makes that breath one.
8.1.1.6.13	If he were to place it differently, he would injure the breath.
8.1.1.6.14	This is the three-layered brick.
8.1.1.6.15	The placing of the formula, the Sūdadoha, that is the three-layer.
8.1.1.6.16	Agni is three-layered.
8.1.1.6.17	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, having made it that much, he places it.
8.1.1.7.1	Then on the right side:
8.1.1.7.2	"This is the southern (brick), the creator of all."
8.1.1.7.3	This very Wind, the All-maker, is he who blows here.
8.1.1.7.4	For he makes all this.
8.1.1.7.5	And because he calls him Dakṣiṇa, therefore he blows mostly from the south.
8.1.1.7.6	The Wind, having become the mind, stood on the right.
8.1.1.7.7	He places that very form.
8.1.1.8.1	Of it, the mind is the All-maker.
8.1.1.8.2	The mind from that form, from the wind, he fashioned.
8.1.1.8.3	The summer is mental.
8.1.1.8.4	He fashioned the summer season from the mind.
8.1.1.8.5	The Tristubh is the summer.
8.1.1.8.6	He fashioned Tristubh metre from the summer season.
8.1.1.8.7	The Tristup is the Svaram.
8.1.1.8.8	He fashioned Svaram Sama from the Tristup metre.
8.1.1.8.9	From the Svarā-rāma, the Antaryāma.
8.1.1.8.10	From the Svarā-rāmā, he created the Antaryāman Graha.
8.1.1.8.11	From the Antaryāmam, the Pañcadaśa.
8.1.1.8.12	From the Antar-yāma Graha, he created the Pañcadaša Stoma.
8.1.1.8.13	From Pañcadaśam, the Brihat.
8.1.1.8.14	From the Pañcada-śa Stoma, he created the Brihat Prstha.
8.1.1.9.1	Bharadvaja is the sage.
8.1.1.9.2	The mind is the sage Bharadvaja.
8.1.1.9.3	Food is the strength.
8.1.1.9.4	He who sustains the mind sustains food and strength.
8.1.1.9.5	Therefore, the mind is the sage, Bharadvaja,
8.1.1.9.6	"You have been taken by Prajapati."
8.1.1.9.7	"You have created by Prajapati.
8.1.1.9.8	"I take this mind for the sake of offspring."
8.1.1.9.9	He places the mind on the right side.
8.1.1.9.10	He places it in various ways.
8.1.1.9.11	He places in it those various desires which are in the mind.
8.1.1.9.12	He places (the mind) once.
8.1.1.9.13	He makes the mind one.
8.1.1.9.14	If he were to place it in various ways, he would split the mind.
8.1.1.9.15	This is the three-fold brick.
8.1.1.9.16	Its relation has been stated.
8.1.2.1.1	Now the one at the back.
8.1.2.1.2	This one at the back is the all-pervading one.
8.1.2.1.3	This very Aditya is the all-pervading.
8.1.2.1.4	For when he rises, then this whole world becomes all-pervuding.
8.1.2.1.5	And because he says it is behind, therefore they see him going back.
8.1.2.1.6	Having become the eye, Aditya stood behind.
8.1.2.1.7	That is the same form. He places it.
8.1.2.2.1	Its eye is all-pervasiveness.
8.1.2.2.2-9	He created the eye from the sun and the form. The rainy season is the eye. He created the rainy season and the eye. The Jagati is the rainy season. The JagatI is the metre. He created from the rainy season. The Jagati is the metre. The Jagati metre is the Sama. The Jagata is the Sama.
8.1.2.2.10	From the Rk-s, the planet Shukra.
8.1.2.2.11	From the Rk-samans, he fashioned the planet Shukra;
8.1.2.2.12	From Shukra, the seventeenfold.
8.1.2.2.13	From the planet Shukra, he fashioned the seventeenfold Stoma;
8.1.2.2.14	From the seventeenfold, the Vaivarna.
8.1.2.2.15	From the seventeen-fold Stoma, he fashioned the Vaivarna Sāman;
8.1.2.3.1	The sage Jamadagni;
8.1.2.3.2	The sage Jamadagni is the eye.
8.1.2.3.3	Because he sees the world with it and understands it, therefore the sage Jamadagni (is the eye).
8.1.2.3.4	"You have been taken by Prajapati."
8.1.2.3.5	This means "You have been created by Prajapati".
8.1.2.3.6	"I take the eye for the sake of offspring."
8.1.2.3.7	He placed the eye at the back.
8.1.2.3.8	He places them in different ways.
8.1.2.3.9	He places those who have different desires in the eye.
8.1.2.3.10	He places them once.
8.1.2.3.11	He makes the eye one.
8.1.2.3.12	If he were to place them differently, he would cut the eye.
8.1.2.3.13	This is the three-fold brick.
8.1.2.3.14	Its relation has been stated.
8.1.2.4.1	And on the north, this is the northern heaven.
8.1.2.4.2	The northern direction is
8.1.2.4.3	The reason why he says 'from the north' is this.
8.1.2.4.4	For the north is the direction from which all directions are.
8.1.2.4.5	And the reason why he says ‘heaven’ is this.
8.1.2.4.6	The heaven is the direction from all directions.
8.1.2.4.7	The ear, having become the directions, stood in the north.
8.1.2.4.8	He places that very form.
8.1.2.5.1	His ear was golden. The ear emanated from that form the directions.
8.1.2.5.2	He fashioned the autumnal season from the ear.
8.1.2.5.3	He fashioned the Anushtubh metre from the autumnal season.
8.1.2.5.4	He fashioned from the Anushtubb metre the Aidal (Saama).
8.1.2.5.5	He fashioned from Aidal the Manthin Graha.
8.1.2.5.6	The twenty-one-fold is the one from the twenty-one-verse hymn.
8.1.2.5.7	From the twenty-one, the twenty-four-verse hymn. The twenty-four-fold is the twenty-four verse hymn.
8.1.2.6.1	The sage Vishvamitra.
8.1.2.6.2	The ear is the sage Vishvamitra.
8.1.2.6.3	Because he hears from all sides and because he is a friend to all, therefore the Rishi Visvamitra (took up) the ear.
8.1.2.6.4	"You have taken it with the Prajapati-grasp."
8.1.2.6.5	"You have grasped it with the Prajapatis-created."
8.1.2.6.6	"I take the ear for the subjects."
8.1.2.6.7	He places the ear on the northern side.
8.1.2.6.8	He places it with different parts.
8.1.2.6.9	Those who have various desires, he places them in the ear.
8.1.2.6.10	He places it down once.
8.1.2.6.11	He makes it one ear.
8.1.2.6.12	If he were to place it down separately, he would cut off the ear.
8.1.2.6.13	This is the three-layered brick.
8.1.2.6.14	Its relation has been explained.
8.1.2.7.1	Now, this is the one in the middle, and this is the one above.
8.1.2.7.2	The moon is above.
8.1.2.7.3	That he places above it,
8.1.2.7.4	The moon is above.
8.1.2.7.5	Now he says, "What is the mind?"
8.1.2.7.6	Speech is the mind.
8.1.2.7.7	For by speech one thinks of everything here.
8.1.2.7.8	Speech became the moon and stood above.
8.1.2.7.9	He places that very form.
8.1.2.8.1	Speech does not exceed that form. From that form of the moon, he created the moon.
8.1.2.8.2	The winter is to be spoken of. He fashioned the winter season as speech.
8.1.2.8.3	The Pankti is the winter. He fashioned the Pankti metre from the winter season.
8.1.2.8.4	The Panktisamans are the end. He fashioned the Saman of the Pankti metre as the end.
8.1.2.8.5	The end is the Aggrayan. He fashioned the Aggrayan cup from the end of the Saman.
8.1.2.8.6-7	From the Āgrayana (graha) he fashioned the Triṇava and Trayastriṃśa (Stoma). From the Āgrayana graha he fashioned the Tri-nava and Trayastrimsa Stomas. From the Tri-nava, Trayastrimsa and Śākvara-Raivata (Stomas) he fashioned the Prstha.
8.1.2.9.1	The sage is Viśvakarman.
8.1.2.9.2	Speech is the sage Viśvakar-man.
8.1.2.9.3	For by speech this whole (universe) is created.
8.1.2.9.4	Therefore speech is the sage Vi-śvakarman,
8.1.2.9.5	'By you who is taken by Prajapati.'
8.1.2.9.6	This means 'by you who is created by Prajapati'.
8.1.2.9.7	'I take speech for the sake of offspring.'
8.1.2.9.8	He placed speech above.
8.1.2.9.9	He places it in different places.
8.1.2.9.10	Those who have various desires, he places in that (brick).
8.1.2.9.11	He places it once.
8.1.2.9.12	He makes it one speech.
8.1.2.9.13	If he were to place it in various ways, he would split the speech.
8.1.2.9.14	This is the Trivrt brick.
8.1.2.9.15	Its relation has been explained.
8.1.2.10.1	This indeed is that food which the vital airs and Prajapati produced.
8.1.2.10.2	This is indeed the whole sacrifice.
8.1.2.10.3	The sacrifice is the food of the gods.
8.1.2.11.1	He places them in ten rows.
8.1.2.11.2	The Viraj has ten syllables.
8.1.2.11.3	The Viraja is the entire food.
8.1.2.11.4	He thus places the entire food in it.
8.1.2.11.5	He places it on all sides.
8.1.2.11.6	He thus puts the entire food in all directions.
8.1.2.11.7	These are the Virajas, they bear these vital airs.
8.1.2.11.8	Because they sustain the vital airs, they are called Prāṇabhṛts.
8.1.3.1.1	They say, "What are the vital airs? What are the Prāṇabhāts?"
8.1.3.1.2	The vital airs themselves are the Prāṇa-bhṛts, because the limbs sustain the vital airs.
8.1.3.1.3	For the limbs sustain the Prāṇas.
8.1.3.1.4	The Prāṇas themselves are the Prānās.
8.1.3.1.5	Food is the Prāṇabhrt.
8.1.3.1.6	For food sustains the Prāṇās.
8.1.3.2.1	They say, how are these all of Prajapati?
8.1.3.2.2	When he says to all of them, "You have been taken by Prajapati," then these all become of Prajapati.
8.1.3.3.1	They say, when one praises after taking the Grahas, then why does one place the verses and chants before the Grahas?
8.1.3.3.2	The arrangement of the rite is to be sought.
8.1.3.3.3	The Grahas are taken up in the form of the Recitation.
8.1.3.3.4	The Sama is sung in the Rc.
8.1.3.3.5	This is his (Agni's) that he places the Rcs and Sāmans before the Grahas.
8.1.3.3.6	And that which is above the Grahas, namely the Stut and Sastra.
8.1.3.3.7	This is indeed his (Agni) that is above the Graha.
8.1.3.3.8	He places the Stotras and the Prsthas together.
8.1.3.4.1	They say, "When these three are performed together, the Graha, the Stotra and the Sastra, then he places the Graha and the Stotra here, how is the Sastra also placed here?"
8.1.3.4.2	What is the Stotra, that is the Sastra.
8.1.3.4.3	For where he praises, there he also recites.
8.1.3.4.4	Thus, here also, the weapon is applied.
8.1.3.5.1	They say, "Just as a son is like his father, so are the first three (verses). Then why does one move from the Rks and Sāmans?"
8.1.3.5.2	The Sāman is the husband of the Rk.
8.1.3.5.3	If one were to say that even there, it is like a son being like his father,
8.1.3.5.4	As one would say to a son who is present, so one would say to him.
8.1.3.5.5	Therefore, it is transferred from the Rkṣa and Sāman.
8.1.3.5.6	Why does one offer three times?
8.1.3.5.7	He offers to the father, son, and grandson.
8.1.3.5.8	Therefore, one gives only to them.
8.1.3.6.1	Those that are placed in front, they are the breath-bearers.
8.1.3.6.2	Then those (nāḍīs) which are behind, they are the bearers of the eye, they are the carriers of Apāna.
8.1.3.6.3	Then those (nādis) which are on the right side, they are the holders of the mind, they are the breathers of Vyāna.
8.1.3.6.4	Then the ones which are on the left side, they are bearers of the ear, they are the upward breathers of Udāna.
8.1.3.6.5	Then (the nāḍīs) which lie in the middle, they are bearers (of the voice), they are the breath-carriers of Samāna.
8.1.3.7.1	This is said by the Adhvaryus of the Caraka school.
8.1.3.7.2	The others are the bearers of Apāna, Vyāna, Udāna, Prāṇa, the eye, mind, ear, and speech.
8.1.3.7.3	They place them.
8.1.3.7.4	One should not do so.
8.1.3.7.5	They shine forth indeed.
8.1.3.7.6	Here alone all these forms are placed.
8.1.3.8.1	Having placed them in front, he places them behind.
8.1.3.8.2-6	Prāṇa, having become Apāna, moves from the tips of the fingers. Apāna, having become Prāṇa, moves from the ends of the fingers. The reason why he places it first and then places it later is that he thus connects and joins these two breaths. Therefore these two breaths are connected and joined.
8.1.3.9.1	Then having placed (the two) on the right, he places (them) on the left.
8.1.3.9.2	He moves from the tips of the fingers, becoming the Vyāna and Udāna.
8.1.3.9.3	He moves, becoming the Udāna and Vyāna, from the tips of his fingers.
8.1.3.9.4	The reason why he places (the two) having placed (them) on his right, on the left,
8.1.3.9.5	is that he thus connects and joins these two breaths.
8.1.3.9.6	Therefore these two Prāṇas are continuous and united.
8.1.3.10.1	Now the one which he places in the middle, that is Prāṇa. He places it between the Retahsiça and the Velya.
8.1.3.10.2	The Retahsiça are the back-bones.
8.1.3.10.3	The back-bones are in the middle.
8.1.3.10.4	He places this Prāṇa in the middle of him.
8.1.3.10.5	He places it on all sides.
8.1.3.10.6	He places Prāṇa in him on all sides.
8.1.3.10.7	Then indeed this anus, the Prāṇa, is spread around the navel.
8.1.3.10.8	He places the Nūchi and the Tirchi bricks.
8.1.3.10.9	Therefore these Prāṇas in the body are touching each other. He places them touching each other.
8.1.3.10.10	He thus sustains and unites the Prāṇas.
8.1.3.10.11	Therefore these prāṇas are sustained and united.
8.1.4.1.1	Some, having placed the man, put it down.
8.1.4.1.2	This indeed is the vital breath.
8.1.4.1.3	They carry him.
8.1.4.1.4	Because they carry the vital breath, therefore they are called Prāṇabhṛt.
8.1.4.1.5	One should not do so.
8.1.4.1.6	This indeed, is the vital breath, which is this golden man.
8.1.4.1.7	His body is as far as this Agni has been laid down.
8.1.4.1.8	If these limbs of his do not reach the navel, then his limbs do not reach the Prāṇa.
8.1.4.1.9	If the Prāṇa does not reach the limbs, then it dries up or withers.
8.1.4.1.10	Therefore, one should offer them after having placed them in a vessel.
8.1.4.1.11	Now the Self of him who places the middle ones is filled with them.
8.1.4.1.12	They are indeed not separated from him.
8.1.4.2.1	They say, "This is in front, this is in the south, this is in back, this is in all directions, this is in heaven, this is in space, this is above, this is the mind."
8.1.4.2.2	Now the directions are mentioned. Why does he place them in the directions?
8.1.4.2.3	The vital airs are the breath-holders.
8.1.4.2.4	If he were to place them in the same directions, then this vital air would move forward.
8.1.4.2.5	Therefore, since they are mentioned thus,
8.1.4.2.6	he places them in the directions.
8.1.4.2.7	Therefore this Prāṇa, being the foremost, moves through all the limbs and the entire self.
8.1.4.3.1	This Agni is indeed the animal.
8.1.4.3.2	Here he is completely made out of everything.
8.1.4.3.3	The two limbs he places in front are the arms.
8.1.4.3.4	The two behind are the thighs.
8.1.4.3.5	The one in the middle is the self.
8.1.4.3.6	He places them in the channel of the semen and blood.
8.1.4.3.7	The semen and blood are the backbones.
8.1.4.3.8	The backbones are the middle.
8.1.4.3.9	For this self is in the middle.
8.1.4.3.10	He places them all around.
8.1.4.3.11	For this Self is all around.
8.1.4.4.1	They say, "In the former groups, he places one Stoma and one Prstha each. But why does he place two Stomas and two Prsthas here?"
8.1.4.4.2	This is his own self.
8.1.4.4.3	He makes the self the most excellent, the most powerful, the most heroic of the limbs.
8.1.4.4.4	Therefore this Self is the eldest, the best, the most powerful of the limbs.
8.1.4.5.1	They say, how is this Agni, the whole, the entire, made in each brick?
8.1.4.5.2	Marrow is the Yajus.
8.1.4.5.3	Bone is the brick.
8.1.4.5.4	Flesh is the covering.
8.1.4.5.5	Skin is the Sudadoha.
8.1.4.5.6	Hair is the Yajush of excrement.
8.1.4.5.7	Food is excrement.
8.1.4.5.8	Thus indeed, this Agni is entirely, completely, sanctified in every brick.
8.1.4.6.1	This is the Agni of all life.
8.1.4.6.2	He who indeed knows this Agni of all life, he indeed attains all life.
8.1.4.7.1	Now then, of the spreading and gathering.
8.1.4.7.2	Some people touch it with the Saman chanting and spreading.
8.1.4.7.3	The Agni is indeed an animal.
8.1.4.7.4	When an animal moves its limbs, then it performs its functions with them.
8.1.4.8.1	You are the year.
8.1.4.8.2	You are a year with a calf.
8.1.4.8.3	You are this year. You are a year with calves.
8.1.4.8.4	You are with calves.
8.1.4.8.5	May your mornings be arranged.
8.1.4.8.6	May your days and nights be arranged.
8.1.4.8.7	 May your half-months be arranged.
8.1.4.8.8	may your months be arranged.
8.1.4.8.9	 may your seasons be arranged.
8.1.4.8.10	Let your year be arranged.
8.1.4.8.11	Going and coming, moving and turning,
8.1.4.8.12	You are the bird.
8.1.4.8.13	By that deity, like Angiras, may I be firm.
8.1.4.9.1	Śāṭyāyani said, "One of the two sides heard the sound. It is by this that one should touch him."
8.1.4.9.2	Therefore, one should touch him with this.
8.1.4.10.1	Then Svarjin said, "The life force is the stretching and contracting of the body."
8.1.4.10.2	In which part of the body the Prāṇa is, that moves and spreads.
8.1.4.10.3	He should draw it out from outside and deposit it in the body.
8.1.4.10.4	He places the Prāṇa in the body, which moves and spreads. Thus it moves and spreads. This is the moving and spreading.
8.1.4.10.5	This is the moving and stretching.
8.1.4.10.6	This is what he said.
8.1.4.10.7	But the king's brother said just what he should have said: "If one hundred times and a thousand times they would have excluded it from outside."
8.1.4.10.8	They did not know that the breath was in him. The breath which is in the self, that is the breath.
8.1.4.10.9	When he places the breath-bearers, he places in him the breath for expansion and contraction.
8.1.4.10.10	So he moves it and sets it in motion.
8.1.4.10.11	Then he lays down the Lokampṛṇā brick.
8.1.4.10.12	The binding is above these two bricks.
8.1.4.10.13	He pours down the earth.
8.1.4.10.14	The binding (of the bricks) is above that.
8.2.1.1.1	He lays down the second layer of bricks.
8.2.1.1.2	The gods, having built the first layer of bricks, ascended it.
8.2.1.1.3	This world is the first layer of the bricks.
8.2.1.1.4	Having thus created this very world, they ascended it.
8.2.1.2.1	They said, "Let us think!"
8.2.1.2.2	They said, indeed, "Let us desire the Cit."
8.2.1.2.3	"Let us desire from here onwards."
8.2.1.2.4	While thinking, they saw this second Cit.
8.2.1.2.5	Whatever is above the earth and below the sky, that world of theirs was like an unsteady, unestablished world in the mind.
8.2.1.3.1	They said to the Ashvins, "You are the Brahmanas, the physicians."
8.2.1.3.2	"You should place this second layer."
8.2.1.3.3	"What will happen to us then?"
8.2.1.3.4	You two alone will be our Adhvaryus at this Agni-laying."
8.2.1.3.5	"They said, "So be it."
8.2.1.3.6	To them the Asvins offered this second layer.
8.2.1.3.7	Therefore they say, "The Asvins are the Adhvaryus of the gods."
8.2.1.4.1	He lays down with the verse, "Firmly placed, of firm origin, firm may I be."
8.2.1.4.2	What is firm and established is Dhruva.
8.2.1.4.3	Or, this world of theirs was like an unsteady, unestablished one in the mind.
8.2.1.4.4	He made it firm and steady and placed it back.
8.2.1.4.5	It settled down in the firm and proper place.
8.2.1.4.6	It settled in the firm and right place.
8.2.1.4.7	Taking the first banner of the Ukhya (fire-pan).
8.2.1.4.8	This Agni is the Ukhya.
8.2.1.4.9	This is the first banner, namely the first layer.
8.2.1.4.10	Taking it, thus is the meaning.
8.2.1.4.11	The Asvins, the Adhvaryus, have placed it here for you.
8.2.1.4.12	For the Asvins are the Adhvaryu priests.
8.2.1.5.1	The householder, the bestower of ghee, the woman.
8.2.1.5.2	The second layer is like a nest.
8.2.1.5.3	"Sit down in the peaceful, auspicious abode of the earth."
8.2.1.5.4	The first layer is the earth.
8.2.1.5.5	"This means, "Sit down in its peaceful, auspicious abode."
8.2.1.5.6	"May the Rudras and Vasus praise you."
8.2.1.5.7	This means, "May these deities praise you."
8.2.1.5.8	"Protect these for good fortune."
8.2.1.5.9	"These are the blessings of Brahma."
8.2.1.5.10	"The Asvins, the Adhvaryus, may they settle you here."
8.2.1.5.11	For the Asvins were the Adhvaryu priests.
8.2.1.6.1	"May you settle here with your own power, O son of Daksha."
8.2.1.6.2	"May you be settled here with your own strength."
8.2.1.6.3	"For the great battle of the gods."
8.2.1.6.4	For the great joy of the gods, for the great battle. This is what it means.
8.2.1.6.5	Like a father to his sons, he shines forth.
8.2.1.6.6	Just as a father shines forth for his son, so he shines forth. This is what this means.
8.2.1.6.7	With your own will, enter into your body.
8.2.1.6.8	The body is the self.
8.2.1.6.9	With your will, enter into yourself. This is what is meant.
8.2.1.6.10	The Asvins, the Adhvaryus, have placed thee here.
8.2.1.6.11	For the Asvins, the two Adhvaryus have placed thee.
8.2.1.7.1	Thou art the dust of the earth.
8.2.1.7.2	The earth is the first layer.
8.2.1.7.3	This is like its dust.
8.2.1.7.4	The second is called 'water', it is called 'sap'.
8.2.1.7.5	May all the gods praise thee.
8.2.1.7.6	May all the gods praise thee thus.
8.2.1.7.7	May she, with the Stoma as her back, come here, rich in ghee.
8.2.1.7.8	The Stoma that is being woven into her, by that she has the Stoma as a back.
8.2.1.7.9	Grant us progeny and wealth.
8.2.1.7.10	Grant us wealth with progeny.
8.2.1.10.3	He thus establishes him in this very firm foundation.
8.2.1.10.4	"She is the supporter of the sky, the upholder of the directions, the ruler of the worlds."
8.2.1.10.5	For she is indeed the supporter of the firmament, the upholder, the ruler of directions, the ruler over the worlds.
8.2.1.10.6	"Thou art the wave, the drop of waters."
8.2.1.10.7	The wave is indeed the sap.
8.2.1.10.8	Viśvakarman is the Rishi.
8.2.1.10.9	Prajapati is indeed Viśvakarmana.
8.2.1.10.10	This means that Prajapati was created.
8.2.1.10.11	The Asvins, the Adhvaryus, have settled here.
8.2.1.10.12	For the Asvins were the Adhvaryu priests.
8.2.1.11.1	When he lays down these Asvinis,
8.2.1.11.2	Prajapati, having been scattered, the deities took him and departed.
8.2.1.11.3	Whatever is above Pratiṣṭhā and below Madhyama, the two Aśvins took that and stood up after stepping over.
8.2.1.12.1	He said to them, "Come near me."
8.2.1.12.2	"Give this back to me by which you stepped over me."
8.2.1.12.3	"What will happen to us then?"
8.2.1.12.4	"This will be yours, dedicated to the gods, and mine will be yours, belonging to the self."
8.2.1.12.5	"So be it."
8.2.1.14.2	What is firm and established is Dhruva.
8.2.1.14.3	Or, this was his unstable, unsteady self, but he has now made it firm and steady and has placed it back.
8.2.1.15.1	"The female of the house, the one with ghee, the female of the house."
8.2.1.15.2	This is his unstable self.
8.2.1.15.3	"O Daksha-father, be seated here with your own Dakshas."
8.2.1.15.4	This is indeed his own body.
8.2.1.15.5	"He places it with the formula, "Thou art the excreta of the earth."
8.2.1.15.6	This is indeed his own excreta.
8.2.1.15.7	"By the channel of the semen-flow.
8.2.1.15.8	The back is the semen-flow."
8.2.1.15.9	This is his own back.
8.2.1.15.10	He places it on all sides.
8.2.1.15.11	For this is his (Agni's) own, and the two Asvins have given it to him on all sides.
8.2.1.16.1	Then he lays down the Rtavya bricks.
8.2.1.16.2	The Rtavya bricks are the seasons.
8.2.1.16.3	He thus lays down the seasons.
8.2.1.16.4	The two bricks of the summer season are called Sukra and Succhi.
8.2.1.16.5	These are their names.
8.2.1.16.6	He thus places them by their names.
8.2.1.16.7	There are two bricks.
8.2.1.16.8	Two months make a season.
8.2.1.16.9	He lays down once.
8.2.1.16.10	He makes it one season.
8.2.1.17.1	What he puts down here,
8.2.1.17.2	This Agni is the year.
8.2.1.17.3	These worlds are the year.
8.2.1.17.4	What is above the earth and below the sky, that is his second layer.
8.2.1.17.5	This is his summer season.
8.2.1.17.6	When he puts these (bricks) here,
8.2.1.18.1	when he puts these (here),
8.2.1.18.2	this Agni is Prajapati.
8.2.1.18.3	Prajapati is the year.
8.2.1.18.4	Of him, what is above the foundation and below the middle, that is his second layer.
8.2.1.18.5	That is his summer season.
8.2.1.18.6	That he puts here,
8.2.1.18.7	that is his own self. He puts it back in him.
8.2.1.18.8	Therefore he puts them here.
8.2.2.1.1	Then he puts down the Vaiśvadevī bricks.
8.2.2.1.2	This is indeed the second layer.
8.2.2.1.3	Whatever they gave to them, the Asvins, that they should give to him, and having given that, everything became as it is now.
8.2.2.2.1	The gods said, "The Asvins have become everything."
8.2.2.2.2	"You should know that we may be here too."
8.2.2.2.3	They said, "Let us think."
8.2.2.2.4	"We want to think," they said.
8.2.2.2.5	May we be like that here too."
8.2.2.2.6	They, reflecting, saw these bricks dedicated to all the gods.
8.2.2.3.1	They said, "The Ashvins were indeed everything.
8.2.2.3.2	We shall place the Ashvins' consecration with the Ashvins."
8.2.2.3.3	They placed the Ashvins' consecrations with the Ashvins.
8.2.2.3.4	Therefore they call this the Asvinī Citi.
8.2.2.3.5	Therefore, just as the earlier ones are ascending, so are these.
8.2.2.3.6	For the Asvins indeed placed the Asvinī citi on the Asvins.
8.2.2.4.1	Now, why he places the Vaishvadevī bricks.
8.2.2.4.2	Those very same All-gods saw this second citi.
8.2.2.4.3-12	Those who are the means by this substance, they are these. He places them here. These are all beings. He places the two (bricks) called Retasicau at the junction. These two are the Retasicau. He places offspring in them. Therefore offspring are in them. He places (the bricks) on all sides. He places all offspring on all sides. Therefore offspring are on all sides.
8.2.2.6.1	Now that Prajapati who fell down, he is indeed this Agni who is being piled up.
8.2.2.6.2	And those creatures who went away from him in the middle, they are indeed these Vaiśvadevī bricks.
8.2.2.6.3	And when he lays down these (bricks), he thus places in him those creatures who went from him in the midst.
8.2.2.6.4	By the means of the seed-bestowing (bricks).
8.2.2.6.5	The two buttocks are the two seed-emitters.
8.2.2.6.6	The buttocks are the middle.
8.2.2.6.7	He places them in the middle, for in the middle he produces these creatures.
8.2.2.6.8	He places (them) all around.
8.2.2.6.9	He produces these creatures all around.
8.2.2.7.1	Now why he places the Vaiśvadevī bricks.
8.2.2.7.2	Prajapati, when he had arranged this (universe), desired, 'May I produce creatures.'
8.2.2.7.3	"May I beget offspring."
8.2.2.7.4	He begot these creatures in union with the seasons, waters, vital airs, the year, and the Ashvins.
8.2.2.7.5	In the same way the sacrificer, in union with these deities, begets these creatures.
8.2.2.7.6	Therefore it is said of all (the deities) that they are in union with one another.
8.2.2.8.1-8	With the seasons, he generated. He generated the seasons. Having become united with the seasons, he generates. With the ordinances, he generated. The ordinances are the waters. For everything here is arranged by the waters. Having become joined with the waters, he generates. With the gods, he generated. 
8.2.2.8.9	He created the gods, for whom they call "the gods."
8.2.2.8.10	"With the gods, the upholders of life,"
8.2.2.8.11	The gods are the vital airs, the upholders.
8.2.2.8.12	For it is by the vital airs that all this is held together.
8.2.2.8.13	Or the gods are the metres, the upholders,
8.2.2.8.14	For it is with the metres that all this is bound together.
8.2.2.8.15	Having become united with the vital airs, he generated (the sacrifice).
8.2.2.8.16	"To Agni, thee, the all-pervading one."
8.2.2.8.17	The year is Agni, the all-embracing.
8.2.2.8.18	Having become united with the year, he generated (it).
8.2.2.8.19	"May the Adhvaryus, the Asvins, settle thee here."
8.2.2.8.20	Having become united to the Asvins, he generated (them).
8.2.2.9.1	With the Vasus, O Jūr, (he said) on the right side.
8.2.2.9.2	He generated the Vasus.
8.2.2.9.3	With the Rudras, O Jūr (he said).
8.2.2.9.4	Behind, he generated the Rudras.
8.2.2.9.5	With the Adityas, O Jūr. On the left side.
8.2.2.9.6	He created the Adityas.
8.2.2.9.7	With the All-Gods, O Jūr above.
8.2.2.9.8	He created all the gods.
8.2.3.2.5-12	These two are the seed-sower. He places the wind in them. Therefore there is wind in them. He places it on all sides. He places wind on all sides. Therefore wind is on all sides, and the wind blows from all sides. Wind blows from all sides, and blows from all directions.
8.2.3.2.13	He places the Dikṣā bricks in the intermediate spaces.
8.2.3.2.14	He places Vayu in the directions.
8.2.3.2.15	Therefore Vayu is in all directions.
8.2.3.3.1	He places the Prāṇabhṛt bricks.
8.2.3.3.2	He places life in the creatures.
8.2.3.3.3	He places them without intervening space between the Vaiśvadevī bricks.
8.2.3.3.4	He thus places life in the progeny without intervening space.
8.2.3.3.5	Protect my Prāṇa, protect my Apāna, protect my Vyāna, protect my eye, protect my ear.
8.2.3.3.6	"The verse is: "O Agni, protect my Prāṇa."
8.2.3.3.7	He places these same Prāṇas in the proper order.
8.2.3.4.1	Then he places the Apasyā bricks.
8.2.3.4.2	The gods said to one another, 'Let us think.'
8.2.3.4.3	They thought, 'Let us build a house.'
8.2.3.4.4	They said this while deliberating.
8.2.3.4.5	They saw the rain as the altar.
8.2.3.4.6	They placed it in this (fire).
8.2.3.4.7	In the same way he places this in it.
8.2.3.5.1	He places it in the womb of the waters.
8.2.3.5.2	The waters are the rain.
8.2.3.5.3	He places the rain in this (fire)
8.2.3.5.4	By the means of the seed-sower.
8.2.3.5.5	These two are the seed-sowers.
8.2.3.5.6	He places that rain in them.
8.2.3.5.7	Therefore it rains from them.
8.2.3.5.8	He places it all around.
8.2.3.5.9	He places that rain all around.
8.2.3.5.10	Therefore it all around. It rains all around.
8.2.3.5.11	All around the same, all around the same.
8.2.3.5.12	He places the rain.
8.2.3.5.13	Therefore it comes down evenly from all directions.
8.2.3.5.14	He places them on the wind side.
8.2.3.5.15	He places the rain in the wind.
8.2.3.5.16	Therefore, the rain follows the direction in which the wind blows.
8.2.3.6.1	And when he places the Apasyas,
8.2.3.6.2	he places the waters in these (vital airs).
8.2.3.6.3	He places them hidden from the vital airs.
8.2.3.6.4	He places the waters in the vital airs without hiding them.
8.2.3.6.5	Then indeed, food is water.
8.2.3.6.6	He places food in the Prāṇas, which is not hidden.
8.2.3.6.7	"He makes water flow, nourishes the plants, protects the bipeds and the quadrupeds, and causes rain from heaven."
8.2.3.6.8	He places water in these (directions) in the form of these (directions).
8.2.3.7.1	Then he places the Chandasya bricks.
8.2.3.7.2	The gods indeed said, "Let us reflect."
8.2.3.8.5	He places the animals on all sides.
8.2.3.8.6	Therefore, animals are on all sides. He places the animals in the water.
8.2.3.8.7	He establishes the animals in the waters.
8.2.3.8.8	Therefore, when it rains, the animals are established.
8.2.3.9.1	When he places the Chandasya bricks,
8.2.3.9.2	the animals had emerged from Prajapati's body, becoming the Chandasya.
8.2.3.10.5	Prajapati himself became the metre.
8.2.3.11.1	"The class is the Vaya (age)."
8.2.3.11.2	Prajapati is the class.
8.2.3.11.3	He became the age.
8.2.3.11.4	"The metre is Mayanda (the unsaid)."
8.2.3.11.5	What is unsaid is Mayanda.
8.2.3.11.6	Prajapati himself is unsaid.
8.2.3.11.7	Prajapatih himself became the metre
8.2.3.12.1	"The class (is) the Vistanbha (support)."
8.2.3.12.2	Prajapatih is the support.
8.2.3.12.3	He became the Vayu (wind).
8.2.3.12.4	Adhipati is the Chanda.
8.2.3.12.5	Prajapati is the Adhipati.
8.2.3.12.6	Prajapater became the Chanda. The Vayu (wind) became the Vayu.
8.2.3.13.1	Vishvakarma is the Vaya.
8.2.3.13.2	Prajapatei is Vishvakarma.
8.2.3.13.3	He became the Vayu
8.2.3.13.4	Parameshthi is the Chanda
8.2.3.13.5	The waters are Prajapati Parameshthi.
8.2.3.13.6	For they stand in the highest place.
8.2.3.13.7	Prajapati himself became the supreme lord, the metre.
8.2.3.14.1	These are indeed the four stages of life.
8.2.3.14.2	The four metres.
8.2.3.14.3	They are eight.
8.2.3.14.4	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
8.2.3.14.5	This indeed is that Gayatri which, having become that, Prajapati attained the stages of life of these animals.
8.2.3.14.6	Therefore, they say that an old animal has attained the stages of its life.
8.2.3.14.7	Therefore, the word 'age' is used in all cases.
8.2.3.14.8	Those who went away from him are these fifteen.
8.2.3.14.9	Cattle are indeed the thunderbolt.
8.2.3.14.10	The fifteen are the thunderbolt.
8.2.3.14.11	Therefore, he who has cattle, indeed, destroys evil.
8.2.3.14.12	The thunderbolt indeed destroys his evil.
8.2.4.2.4	The metre is Viśāla, consisting of two feet.
8.2.4.2.5	Having become two-footed, they moved up.
8.2.4.3.1	"The person is our age."
8.2.4.3.2	He attained the person with his age.
8.2.4.3.3	"The metre is called Tandra."
8.2.4.3.4	The metre is Paṅkti.
8.2.4.3.5	Having become Paṅkti, they moved up as persons.
8.2.4.4.1	"The tiger is our age." (The tiger is our size.)
8.2.4.4.2	He attained the tiger with his age. (He attained the tiger by his size.)
8.2.4.4.3	"The metre called Anādhṛṣṭa."
8.2.4.4.4	Viraj is the unassailable metre.
8.2.4.4.5	Viraj is food.
8.2.4.4.6	Food is unassailable.
8.2.4.4.7	Having become Viraj, the tigers went forth.
8.2.4.5.1	"We are lions."
8.2.4.5.2	He attained the lion with his age.
8.2.4.5.3	The metre is Chashdi.
8.2.4.5.4	Chashdi is the metre of excess.
8.2.4.5.5	For it covers all the metres.
8.2.4.5.6	Having become the lionesses, they roared.
8.2.4.5.7	Now, he places the animals and the metres which are mentioned.
8.2.4.6.1	"He says, "We are the Prsthavats."
8.2.4.6.2	He attains the Prsthavat by age.
8.2.4.6.3	" "The metre is Brihatī."
8.2.4.6.4	Having become the lionesses they roared.
8.2.4.7.1	" "We are the oxen."
8.2.4.7.2	He attained the oxen by age.
8.2.4.14.4	Having become the Uṣṇīg, they went forth with three calves.
8.2.4.15.1	"The fourth is the age."
8.2.4.15.2	"The fourth age is seven."
8.2.4.15.3	"The metre is Anushtup."
8.2.4.15.4	Having become the Anushtup, they went forth in the fourth age.
8.2.4.16.1	These are indeed those animals which Prajapati attained with age.
8.2.4.16.2	He first mentioned the animal, then the age, then the metre.
8.2.4.16.3	And having attained them by age and by metre, he made them his own, he made them himself.
8.2.4.16.4	And in the same way this one makes them his own, makes them himself, having attained them by both age and metre.
8.2.4.17.1	This Agni is indeed that animal.
8.2.4.17.2	Here he is made entirely, completely.
8.2.4.17.3	Of him, those which he places in front, they are his head.
8.2.4.17.4	Now that which is on the right and left of that is the Self.
8.2.4.17.5	And that which is behind is the tail.
8.2.4.18.1	He places it first in front,
8.2.4.18.2	for the head is the first to be born of one being born.
8.2.4.18.3	Then having placed it on the right and on the left, he places it together, saying, "May this Self be united."
8.2.4.18.4	Then behind, the tail.
8.2.4.18.5	For the tail is the last to be born of what is being born.
8.2.4.19.1	Those which are the most excellent metres and the most excellent animals, he places in the middle.
8.2.4.19.2	He makes the animal in the middle more excellent.
8.2.4.19.3	Therefore the animal in the centre is more excellent.
8.2.4.19.4	Then those animals which are most vigorous, he places on the right side.
8.2.4.19.5	He makes that half of the animal on the right side more vigorous.
8.2.4.19.6	Therefore the right half of the animal is more vigorous.
8.2.4.20.1	He makes the front half and the hind half the smallest.
8.2.4.20.2	Because there are four of them here.
8.2.4.20.3	Therefore they are the smallest.
8.2.4.20.4	And because he places the smallest animals here, therefore they are the smallest.
8.2.4.20.5	He makes the two halves of the animal's buttocks the smallest.
8.2.4.20.6	Therefore the two halves of an animal, the front and the rear, are the smallest.
8.2.4.20.7	Because of this, the animal rises up and enters with the front and rear halves.
8.2.4.20.8	Then he places the Lokamprinas on this string.
8.2.4.20.9	The two are above the bond.
8.2.4.20.10	He scatters the dung.
8.2.4.20.11	His kinsman is above him.
8.3.1.1.1	He places the third layer.
8.3.1.1.2	Having built the second layer, the gods ascended it.
8.3.1.1.3	What was above the earth and below the sky, having made that auspicious, they ascended.
8.3.1.2.1	They said, "Let us think." They said, "We want to build the Citi." They said, "We want to build it from here onwards."
8.3.1.2.2	While thinking, they saw the Bṛhatī Citi in the sky.
8.3.1.2.3	This world gave them (the Citi).
8.3.1.3.1	Indra and Agni said, "You two should build this third Citi.
8.3.1.3.2	What will happen to us then?"
8.3.1.3.3	"You two will be the best of us."
8.3.1.3.4	"So be it."
8.3.1.3.5	Indra and Agni gave them this third layer.
8.3.1.3.6	Therefore they say that Indra and Agni are the best of the gods.
8.3.1.4.1	He places it with Indra and Agni, and settles it with Visvakarman.
8.3.1.4.2	Indra and Agni and Visvakarman saw this third layer.
8.3.1.4.3	Therefore he places it with Indra and Agni, and settles it with Visvakarman.
8.3.1.5.1	When he places it with (Indra and) Agni, and settles with Visvakar-man,
8.3.1.5.2	Prajapati, having been scattered, the deities took him and departed.
8.3.1.5.3	Of him, Indra and Agni and Vishvakarman took the middle and stood above.
8.3.1.6.1	He said to them, "Come to me, take this from me by which you have gone away from me."
8.3.1.6.2	"What will be ours from that?"
8.3.1.6.3	"This will be yours, dedicated to your deities, from my self."
8.3.1.6.4	"So be it."
8.3.1.6.5	Indra-Agni and Visvakarman placed this in him.
8.3.1.7.1	This is his middle natural (layer), this is his self.
8.3.1.7.2	Now, when he places this (brick) here, he places in it that which is of his own self.
8.3.1.7.3	Therefore he places this here.
8.3.1.8.1	"O Indra and Agni, ye two, place the brick which is not to be injured."
8.3.1.8.2	The binding (of the bricks) is as the text.
8.3.1.8.3	"Ye have obstructed the sky, the earth and the atmosphere with the back."
8.3.1.9.5	"Protect the space, stabilize the space, do not harm the space."
8.3.1.9.6	"Protect the self, stabilize the self, do not harm oneself." This is it.
8.3.1.10.1	For all the vital airs - the exhalation, inhalation, upward movement, and downward movement.
8.3.1.10.2	The vital air is indeed the Self-Sustaining.
8.3.1.10.3	For all of this, the vital air is for support and movement.
8.3.1.10.4	These worlds are indeed the Self-sustaining.
8.3.1.10.5	These are the worlds, the support, the conduct.
8.3.1.10.6	"May Vayu protect you."
8.3.1.10.7	"May Vāyu guard you."
8.3.1.10.8	"This is for your great welfare."
8.3.1.10.9	"This means 'for your great welfare."'"
8.3.1.10.10	"May the vomiting be peaceful."
8.3.1.10.11	"This refers to 'may the vomiting be peaceful.'"
8.3.1.10.12	Having settled down, he recites the Sūdadohasūkta.
8.3.1.10.13	His relation is told.
8.3.1.10.14	Then he sings the Saman.
8.3.1.10.15	His relation is above.
8.3.1.11.1	Then he lays down the Disya bricks.
8.3.1.11.2	The Disya bricks are the directions.
8.3.1.11.3	He lays down the directions.
8.3.1.11.4	The wind comes to them with the directions which are not obstructed.
8.3.1.11.5	He lays them down as these.
8.3.1.11.6-11	Those very ones, in front, he places the darbha-bunch and the bricks for the fire-altar. This is the sun. He places that sun in the directions. He places them in the directions. If they were to be there, they would be outside. Outside the womb of the fire-ritual is the lotus-leaf.
8.3.1.11.12	If she places them after having taken them, then she establishes them in the lotus-leaf of the womb.
8.3.1.11.13	Thus indeed they become outside.
8.3.1.11.14	She places them without being covered by the Svayambhu grass.
8.3.1.11.15	The middle one is indeed the Svayambhū grass of the sky.
8.3.1.11.16	She places the directions within the sky.
8.3.1.11.17	The northern ones are the directions within the northern sky.
8.3.1.13.2	The quarters are the metres.
8.3.1.13.3	The metres are the cattle.
8.3.1.13.4	Cattle are food.
8.3.1.13.5	The middle layer is the middle.
8.3.1.13.6	He places food in the middle.
8.3.1.13.7	They are placed without intervening the Svayambhu.
8.3.1.13.8	The Svayambhu is the breath. He places food within the breath.
8.3.1.13.9	He places it above the north. He places food above the breath.
8.3.1.13.10	The two Retahsiras (semen-seeders) are placed in the middle.
8.3.1.13.11	The two Retahsirs are the two sides.
8.3.1.13.12	The middle is the sides.
8.3.1.13.13	He places the food in the middle of it.
8.3.1.13.14	He places it all around.
8.3.1.13.15	He places food all around in it.
8.3.1.14.1	"Obeisance to the Queen, the eastern direction."
8.3.1.14.2	"Obeissance to Viraj, the southern direction."
8.3.1.14.3	" Obeisance to Samraj, the western direction."
8.3.1.14.4	The Udichi direction is his own.
8.3.1.14.5	"You are the overlord of the Brihatī direction."
8.3.1.14.6	These are their names.
8.3.1.14.7	He places them with their names.
8.3.1.14.8	She places them separately, settles them separately, and recites the Sūdadohas separately.
8.3.1.14.9	The directions are different.
8.3.2.1.1	Then he places the Viśva-jyotiṣa (brick).
8.3.2.1.2	Vāyu is the Viśvajyotiṣa in the middle.
8.3.2.1.3	The wind indeed is the world of the atmosphere, the light of all.
8.3.2.1.4	He thus places the wind.
8.3.2.1.5	He places it in the directions without interruption.
8.3.2.1.6	He thus puts the wind in the directions.
8.3.2.1.7	Therefore the wind is in all directions.
8.3.2.2.1	Now, why he places the Viśva-jyotiṣ (bricks).
8.3.2.2.2	The Viśva- jyotiṣ is the progeny.
8.3.2.2.3	The progeny indeed is the light of all.
8.3.2.2.4	He places it close to the two directions.
8.3.2.2.5	He places it close to those two directions.
8.3.2.2.6	In the directions he places the offspring.
8.3.2.2.7	Therefore, in all directions there are offspring.
8.3.2.3.1	May Visvakarman settle thee.
8.3.2.3.2	For Visvakarman saw this third layer.
8.3.2.3.3	On the back of the sky, shining.
8.3.2.3.4	For this is the luminous wind on the back of space.
8.3.2.4.1	"For all the breaths, for the out-breath, for the through-breath."
8.3.2.4.2	The breath indeed is the universal light.
8.3.2.4.3	The breath is for all of him.
8.3.2.4.4	"He says, 'May I obtain the universal light.'
8.3.2.4.5	'May I obtain all light.'
8.3.2.4.6	'This is your lord.'
8.3.2.4.7	He makes the wind his lord.
8.3.2.4.8	Having placed them, he recites the Sūdadohas verse.
8.3.2.4.9	His relation has been stated.
8.3.2.5.1	Now he places the Rtuvyā bricks.
8.3.2.5.2	The Rtuvyā are indeed the seasons.
8.3.2.5.3	He places the seasons.
8.3.2.5.4	The names of these two are Nabhas and Nabhasya.
8.3.2.5.5	He places them by their names.
8.3.2.5.6	There are two bricks.
8.3.2.5.7	Two months make a season.
8.3.2.5.8	He places them together.
8.3.2.5.9	He makes it one season.
8.3.2.5.10	He puts down the Avakā plants.
8.3.2.5.11	He covers them with Avakā plants
8.3.2.5.12	Avakā plants are water.
8.3.2.5.13	He puts water in this season.
8.3.2.5.14	Therefore it rains most in this season.
8.3.2.6.1	Then the two seasons of autumn, namely, Iṣa and Urja, are named after them.
8.3.2.6.2	He places them with their names.
8.3.2.6.3	There are two bricks.
8.3.2.6.4	For two months make a season.
8.3.2.6.5	He lays them down together.
8.3.2.6.6	He makes one season.
8.3.2.6.7	He places the Avakā-bricks.
8.3.2.6.8	Avakā is water.
8.3.2.6.9	He places it in front of this season.
8.3.2.6.10	Therefore it rains in front of this (season).
8.3.2.6.11	He does not cover it above.
8.3.2.6.12	Therefore it does not rain like that above.
8.3.2.7.1	What he places here,
8.3.2.7.2	this Agni is the year.
8.3.2.7.3	These worlds are the year.
8.3.2.7.4	The middle layer of this (Agni) is indeed the sky.
8.3.2.7.5	The sky is his autumn and winter.
8.3.2.7.6	The reason why he puts these (bricks) here is
8.3.2.7.7	that he thus restores to him what belongs to him.
8.3.2.7.8	Therefore he puts them here.
8.3.2.8.1	The reason also why he puts them here is
8.3.2.8.2	that this Agni is Prajapati,
8.3.2.8.3	and the year is Prajapati.
8.3.2.8.4	In the middle of that (fire-altar) he places the middle layer.
8.3.2.8.5	The middle season is autumn and winter.
8.3.2.8.6	That he places here,
8.3.2.8.7	it is that which belongs to his body, he places it back in him.
8.3.2.8.8	Therefore he places it here.
8.3.2.9.1	These are the four seasons.
8.3.2.9.2	He places them on the middle layer,
8.3.2.9.3	two each on the other layers.
8.3.2.11.2	The space between the two is four syllables.
8.3.2.11.3	The other layers are two syllables.
8.3.2.11.4	He places it so that it is as big as the space between the two.
8.3.2.12.1	And why there are four.
8.3.2.12.2	The Agni is an animal.
8.3.2.12.3	He makes the animal the best in the middle.
8.3.2.12.4	Therefore the animal is the best in the centre.
8.3.2.13.1	These are the four Rituya layers.
8.3.2.13.2-8	The five directions are the five lights of the world, and that makes ten. The Viraj is food. The Viraj is the middle, and the middle is the middle layer. He places the food in the middle. He places them without interruption to the Svayamatrna. Svayamatrna is the breath. He places food without interruption from the breath.
8.3.2.13.9	The Uttarā Uttarā (brick) is the food of the Prāṇa.
8.3.2.14.1	Then he lays down the Prāṇabhṛt bricks.
8.3.2.14.2	The Prāṇabhृt bricks are the Prāṇas.
8.3.2.14.3	He thus lays down the Prānās.
8.3.2.14.4	They are ten in number.
8.3.2.14.5	There are ten Prāṇās. He lays them down in the eastern half.
8.3.2.14.6	The Prānās are in front.
8.3.2.14.7	"Protect my life."
8.3.2.14.8	"May light be mine."
8.3.2.14.9	Light is the Prāṇa.
8.3.3.1.5	Therefore, the animals are in the sky.
8.3.3.2.1	When he places the Chanda-bricks,
8.3.3.2.2	the animals are the Chanda-s.
8.3.3.2.3	Animals are food.
8.3.3.2.4	The middle layer is the middle layer of bricks.
8.3.3.2.5	He places food in the middle.
8.3.3.3.1	He places twelve-twelve bricks.
8.3.3.3.2	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
8.3.3.3.3	Animals are Jagati.
8.3.3.3.4	The middle layers are the sky.
8.3.3.4.8	He places food in the Prāṇas.
8.3.3.4.9	The latter is superior to the former.
8.3.3.4.10	He places food in the Pranas.
8.3.3.5.1	"The Chanda called "Ma"."
8.3.3.5.2	This world is Ma.
8.3.3.5.3	This world is like a measure.
8.3.3.5.4	The Chanda called "Prama"
8.3.3.5.5	The Antarikṣa world is Prama.
8.3.3.5.6	The Antarikșa world is like a measured distance from this world.
8.3.3.5.7	The Chandra called "Pratimā"
8.3.3.5.8-14	This is the world of the image. For this world is like an image in the world of the sky. The verse is the Asrivasya. Food is the Asri-vasya. Whatever food there is in these worlds, that is the Asriva-sya. And whatever food flows from these worlds, that also is the Asri va-sya. Now then, he places the verses that are named.
8.3.3.6.1	The Viraj has eight metres. He places them in the womb of the Viraj.
8.3.3.6.2	The earth is a metre, the sky is a metre.
8.3.3.7.2	If he had put in all the names, the food would have been limited and would have been exhausted.
8.3.3.7.3	If he had put in none of the names, the quantity of food would have been unlimited.
8.3.3.7.4	No one would have seen it.
8.3.3.7.5	He puts in both named and unnamed (names). Therefore, the named food, when eaten, does not get exhausted.
8.3.3.8.1	Those three twelve-fold layers are placed; that makes thirty-six.
8.3.3.8.2	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
8.3.3.8.3	That is the Brihatī, which the gods saw in the sky, the third layer.
8.3.3.8.4	Of that, these are the highest.
8.3.3.9.1	In that he places these bricks,
8.3.3.9.2	From Prajapati, when he was relaxed, all beings and all directions spread out.
8.3.3.10.1	He who was Prajapati when he relaxed, is indeed this very Agni who is being built.
8.3.3.10.2	And those beings that spread out from him, are indeed these bricks. And when he places them,
8.3.3.10.3	The beings that have gone out from him, he puts back into him.
8.3.3.11.1	The ten which he puts down first,
8.3.3.11.2	that is the moon.
8.3.3.11.3	They are ten in number.
8.3.3.11.4	The Viraj has ten syllables.
8.3.3.11.5	Food is Viraj.
8.3.3.11.6	Food is the moon.
8.3.4.1.6	The vital airs are not interrupted even from the size of a hair.
8.3.4.1.7	Because they are not interrupted even at the size of a strand of hair, therefore they are called Valakhilyas.
8.3.4.2.1	He places seven in front and seven behind.
8.3.4.2.2	Those seven which he places in front,
8.3.4.2.3	Those seven vital airs which are in front, he places them in this (fire).
8.3.4.3.1	Now, those seven which are behind, he thereby makes these (seven) breaths to be the same as those (seven) breaths.
8.3.4.3.2	Therefore, whatever food one eats with them, one passes beyond with them.
8.3.4.4.1	And in that he places seven in front,
8.3.4.4.2	there are seven breaths in front: the four arms, the head, the neck, and what is above the navel is the seventh.
8.3.4.4.3	For the life-breath is in every limb.
8.3.4.4.4	These seven are the life-breaths in front.
8.3.4.4.5	He places them in him.
8.3.4.5.1	And those seven behind.
8.3.4.5.2	These seven life-breaths are behind: four in the thighs, two in the buttocks, what is below the navel is the seventh.
8.3.4.5.3	For the life-breath indeed is in every limb; these seven are
8.3.4.7.1	The reason why he lays down the Valakhilyas is
8.3.4.7.2	The gods, indeed, by means of the Valakhilyan (stones) reached this world from here and from there, from above and from below.
8.3.4.7.3	In the same way the sacrificer, by means of Valakhilyas, reaches this world from here, from above and below.
8.3.4.8.1	"Thou art the head, thou art the king," (thus) ascending this world.
8.3.4.8.2	"You are Dhruva, the firm one," for the world of the atmosphere.
8.3.4.8.3	"You are Dhritri, the supporter," for this world.
8.3.4.8.4	"You support," for this world, for your life, for your radiance, for your cultivation, for your welfare." The four-footed animals are the four-footed animals.
8.3.4.8.5	Animals are food.
8.3.4.11.2	The eleven bricks which are laid down are the atmosphere, and that is the Self.
8.3.4.11.3	And because they are eleven in number,
8.3.4.11.4	for the Tristubh metre has eleven syllables, and the atmosphere is Tristubh.
8.3.4.11.5	And the sixty which are laid down afterwards are Vayu, Prajapati, Agni, and the Sacrificer.
8.3.4.12.1	Those which he lays down in front, they are the head of him.
8.3.4.12.2	They are ten in number.
8.3.4.12.3	There are ten vital airs.
8.3.4.12.4	The vital airs are the head.
8.3.4.12.5	He lays them down in the eastern half, because the head is in front.
8.3.4.13.1	Those which are on the right side, they are that which is above the middle and below the head.
8.3.4.13.2	Now those which are behind, and those which are above, and those which belong to Pratiṣṭhā, and those which lie below the middle, they are his.
8.3.4.13.3	Those which are towards the north are indeed Pratiṣṭhāna.
8.3.4.14.1	Those seven which he lays down in front, the Vālakhilyas, they are the seven breaths which are in front of him, he puts them in him.
8.3.4.14.2	He lays them down without interruption from these ten.
8.3.4.14.3	He places the vital airs of the head in the front.
8.3.4.15.1	Then those seven behind, those seven vital airs which are behind, he places them in this (head).
8.3.4.15.2	He places them in the front, not separated from those twelve.
8.3.4.15.3	He places the vital airs in the self in the front.
8.3.4.15.4	This Vayu, Prajapati, has spread himself all around in this Trishtup metre in the atmosphere.
8.3.4.15.5	When he places the third layer, he places it after having arranged Vayu and the atmosphere.
8.3.4.15.6	Then he places the Lokamprana bricks on this line.
8.3.4.15.7	The two are above the bond.
8.3.4.15.8	He pours down the earth.
8.3.4.15.9	His kinsman is above him.
8.4.1.1.1	He places the fourth layer.
8.4.1.1.2	The gods, having built the third layer, ascended it.
8.4.1.1.3	The third layer is indeed the atmosphere.
8.4.1.1.4	Having sanctified the atmosphere, they ascended it.
8.4.1.2.1	They said, "Let us think." They said, "We want to think about the altar." They said, "We want to think beyond this."
8.4.1.2.2	While thinking, they saw this fourth altar, which is above the atmosphere and below the sky.
8.4.1.2.3	This world of theirs was like an unstable, unsteady mind.
8.4.1.3.1	They said to Brahma, "We shall place you here."
8.4.1.3.2	"What will happen to me then?"
8.4.1.3.3	"You will be the best among us."
8.4.1.3.4	"So be it."
8.4.1.3.5	They placed him here.
8.4.1.3.6	Therefore they say, "Brahma is the best of the gods."
8.4.1.3.7	And by this fourth (verse) these heaven and earth are established.
8.4.1.3.8	The fourth layer is indeed Brahman.
8.4.1.3.9	Therefore they say, "Heaven and earth are supported by Brahman."
8.4.1.3.10	He lays down the Stoma layers.
8.4.1.3.11	The Stoma layers are indeed the vital airs.
8.4.1.3.12	The vital airs are indeed Brahman.
8.4.1.3.13	He thus lays down Brahman.
8.4.1.4.1	In that he lays down the Stomas,
8.4.1.4.2	The gods said to Prajapati, "We shall install you here."
8.4.1.4.3	He said, "Yes."
8.4.1.4.4	He did not say, "What will happen to me then?"
8.4.1.4.5	Whatever Prajapati did among the gods, they said, "What will that do to us?"
8.4.1.4.6	Therefore, they say, "What will be ours from that?" when the father wishes something for his sons.
8.4.1.4.7	And when the sons say, "So be it," to the father.
8.4.1.4.8	For thus did Prajapati and the gods agree in the beginning.
8.4.1.4.9	He lays down the Stoma-bricks.
8.4.1.4.10	The Stoma-bricks are the vital airs.
8.4.1.4.11	The vital airs are Prajapati.
8.4.1.4.12	He thus places Prajapati himself.
8.4.1.5.1	Now, why he places the Stoma-bricks.
8.4.1.5.2	The Rishis, the vital airs, saw this fourth layer and approached it with this juice. They are these (Stoma-bricks).
8.4.1.5.3	He thus places them.
8.4.1.5.4	He places the Stoma bricks.
8.4.1.5.5	The Stoma-bricks are the vital airs.
8.4.1.5.6	The Rshis are the vital airs.
8.4.1.5.7	He thus places the Rsis.
8.4.1.6.1	Now, why he places the Stomas.
8.4.1.6.2	Prajapati, having been scattered, the deities took him and went away.
8.4.1.6.3	The wind, having taken what was above the middle and below the head, stood up, having become the deities and the Stomas of the year.
8.4.1.7.1	He said to him, "Come to me, give this back to me with which you have gone away from me."
8.4.1.7.2	"What will happen to me then?"
8.4.1.7.3	"This will be yours, dedicated to you, for your self."
8.4.1.7.4	"So be it."
8.4.1.7.5	Then Vayu gave it back to him.
8.4.1.8.1	That is the first of the eighteen, which is his self.
8.4.1.8.2	Now, when he puts these (bricks) here, he puts back in it what belongs to its body.
8.4.1.8.3	Therefore he puts these here.
8.4.1.8.4	He puts down the Stoma bricks.
8.4.1.8.5	The Stoma bricks are the vital airs.
8.4.1.8.6	The vital airs are Vayu.
8.4.1.8.7	He thus puts down Vayu.
8.4.1.9.1	It is put down in front, with the text, "Swift, three-fold."
8.4.1.9.2	He places it in the form of the Trivrt stoma.
8.4.1.9.3	When he says, "The swift one,"
8.4.1.9.4	it is because this is the most excellent of the stomas.
8.4.1.9.5	And also because Vayu is the swift one and the Trivrt.
8.4.1.9.6	He moves in these three worlds. When he says, "the swift one,"
8.4.1.9.7	this is because it is the most excellent among all beings.
8.4.1.9.8	Having become the wind, he stood in front.
8.4.1.9.9	He places that very form.
8.4.1.10.1	"The fifteen shining ones." He places that very fifteen-fold Stoma.
8.4.1.10.2	And why he says "shining ones"
8.4.1.10.3	The thunderbolt is indeed shining.
8.4.1.10.4	The thunderbolt is fifteen-fold.
8.4.1.10.5	And the moon is indeed the fifteen shining ones.
8.4.1.10.6	It is filled up in fifteen days and is diminished in fifteen days.
8.4.1.10.7	That is why it is called 'shining'.
8.4.1.10.8	The moon shines.
8.4.1.10.9	Having become the moon, it stands to the south.
8.4.1.10.10	It places that very form.
8.4.1.11.1	'Space, seventeen.'
8.4.1.11.2	That very seventeen-fold Stoma it places.
8.4.1.11.3	That is what it means when it says 'space'.
8.4.1.11.4	Prajapati is the Vyoman, Prajapati is seventeen.
8.4.1.11.5	And indeed the year is the Vyoman and seventeen.
8.4.1.11.6	It has twelve months and five seasons.
8.4.1.11.7	That he calls it Vyoman.
8.4.1.11.8	For the year is Vyoman.
8.4.1.11.9	Having become the year, he stands on the other side.
8.4.1.11.10	He places that very form.
8.4.1.12.1	The Dhruva is twenty-one.
8.4.1.12.2	The Ekavimsa (Stoma) is the same as that which he places.
8.4.1.12.3	And when he says, 'The firm one',
8.4.1.12.4	the firm one is indeed the foundation, and the Ekavimsa is the foundation.
8.4.1.12.5	And this Aditya is the firm one, the Ekavimša.
8.4.1.12.6	Of him, the twelve months, the five seasons, the three worlds, and this Aditya is the Ekavimśa, the firm one.
8.4.1.12.7	And when it is said, 'The firm',
8.4.1.12.8	When he sets, then all this is held.
8.4.1.12.9	Having become the sun, he stands behind.
8.4.1.12.10	He places that very form.
8.4.1.12.11	Then he places the forms of the year.
8.4.1.13.1	The rush is eighteen.
8.4.1.13.2	He places it as the eighteen Stoma.
8.4.1.13.3	Now indeed the year is the eighteenfold Pratiriti.
8.4.1.13.4	Of it there are twelve months and five seasons.
8.4.1.13.5	The year itself is the eighteenfold Pratirti.
8.4.1.13.6	That he calls Pratirti,
8.4.1.13.7	for the year indeed is the support of all beings.
8.4.1.13.8	That indeed is its form.
8.4.1.14.1	It is the ninefold Tapas.
8.4.1.14.2	He places it in the form of the Navadasha Stoma.
8.4.1.14.3	And indeed the Navadasha is the Tapas of the year.
8.4.1.14.4	It has twelve months, six seasons.
8.4.1.14.5	The Navadasha is indeed the Tapas of the Year.
8.4.1.14.6	When he says that it is Tapas,
8.4.1.14.7	it is because the year burns all beings.
8.4.1.14.8	He places it in that very form.
8.4.1.15.1	The Abhivarta is the Savisha.
8.4.1.15.2	The Savisha Stoma is the same as that. He places it there.
8.4.1.15.3	Now, the Savisha is indeed the year.
8.4.1.15.4	It has twelve months and seven seasons.
8.4.1.15.5	The Savisha is indeed a year.
8.4.1.15.6	When he says, "The Savisha,"
8.4.1.15.7	it is because the year indeed prevails over all beings.
8.4.1.15.8	He places that very form.
8.4.1.16.1	The Varca (stoma) is of twenty-two (sastras).
8.4.1.16.2	He puts it in that place where the twenty-two stomas are.
8.4.1.16.3	And indeed, the Varca (stoma), indeed, is of twenty- two (sastras) in the year.
8.4.1.16.4	It has twelve months, seven seasons, two days and nights.
8.4.1.16.5	The Varca (stoma is) indeed of twenty-two in the year. It is of twenty-four in the year. The Varca (stomas) are of twenty-two.
8.4.1.16.6	And why he calls it Varca.
8.4.1.18.4	And of that, twenty-four half-months.
8.4.1.18.5	And he says of it, "The womb."
8.4.1.18.6	For the year is indeed the womb of all beings.
8.4.1.18.7	He places that very form.
8.4.1.19.1	"The embryos are twenty-five."
8.4.1.19.2	He places that which is the twenty-five-fold Stoma.
8.4.1.19.3	And indeed the year is the twenty- five embryos.
8.4.1.19.4	And twenty-four of them are half-months.
8.4.1.19.5	The embryo is indeed the twenty-fifth year.
8.4.1.19.6	And the reason why he calls it an embryo is this:
8.4.1.19.7	The year, having become the embryo, enters the seasons.
8.4.1.19.8	He places that very form.
8.4.1.20.1	"Ojas, Tri-navas."
8.4.1.20.2	He places that which is the Tri-navas Stoma.
8.4.1.20.3-9	The reason why he says, "Ojas" is this. The thunderbolt is Ojas, the thunderbolt is Tri-nav. Or, the year is Ojas, Tri-nav. It has twenty-four half-months, two days and nights. The year itself is Ojas, Trina-v. The reason why he says "Ojas" (is this). For the year is the most vigorous of all beings.
8.4.1.20.10	He places that very form.
8.4.1.21.1	"It is the Kratu of thirty-one."
8.4.1.21.2	He places that very thirty-one stoma.
8.4.1.21.3	And indeed, the Kratu of Thirty-one is the year.
8.4.1.21.4	It has twenty-four half-months and six seasons.
8.4.1.21.5	The Kratu of Thirty One is indeed the year.
8.4.1.21.6	And when he says it is the Kratu,
8.4.1.22.6	And of that, twenty-four half-months, six seasons, and two days and nights.
8.4.1.22.7	The year itself is the foundation, the thirty-three.
8.4.1.22.8	That is why he calls it the foundation.
8.4.1.22.9	For the year is the foundation of all beings.
8.4.1.22.10	That itself is its form. He places it.
8.4.1.23.1	The thirty-four is the expanse of the sky.
8.4.1.23.2	He places it in the form of the thirty-four Stoma.
8.4.1.23.3	Now, indeed, the thirty-four is the extent of the year.
8.4.1.23.4	Of that, twenty-four are half-months, seven are seasons, and two are day and night.
8.4.1.23.5	The thirty-four is indeed the extent of the extent of the universe.
8.4.1.23.6	That he calls the extent of the expanse of the universe.
8.4.1.23.7	The self-sovereignty is the expanse of the heaven.
8.4.1.23.8	The self-sovereignty consists of thirty-four verses.
8.4.1.23.9	He places that very form.
8.4.1.24.1	The heaven is thirty-six verses.
8.4.1.24.2	He puts in that very thirty-six verses which are the heaven.
8.4.1.24.3	And indeed the heaven is the year consisting of thirty-six verses.
8.4.1.24.4	And of that, twenty-four half-months, twelve months.
8.4.1.24.5	And that is why it is called heaven.
8.4.1.24.6	For to one who has gone there, there is no heaven for anyone else.
8.4.1.24.7	And indeed, the year is heaven, the year is the heavenly world.
8.4.1.24.8	That is the same form he establishes.
8.4.1.25.1	The turning is forty-eight.
8.4.1.25.2	The Stoma is forty-eight; he places it in that (layer).
8.4.1.25.3	Now indeed the year is forty-eight, the turning.
8.4.1.25.4	Of it, twenty-six half-months, thirteen months, seven seasons, two day and night.
8.4.1.25.5	That he calls it the turning.
8.4.1.25.6	For from the year all beings turn.
8.4.1.25.7	He places that very form.
8.4.1.26.1	"It is the "Dhartr" (the supporter), the Catuṣṭoma."
8.4.1.26.2	He places that very Catuṣṭomah Stoma.
8.4.1.26.3	And when he says, "Dharta,";
8.4.1.26.4	Dharta means support, and Catuṣṭomā means support.
8.4.1.26.5	And indeed, the Catuṣtoma is the wind.
8.4.1.26.6	He is praised by these four directions.
8.4.1.26.7	That is why he says, 'The supporter.'
8.4.1.26.8	The supporter is indeed the foundation.
8.4.1.26.9	The wind is the foundation of all beings.
8.4.1.26.10	He places that very form.
8.4.1.26.11	He places the wind first and the wind last.
8.4.1.26.12	By means of the wind, he thus encloses all these beings on both sides.
8.4.1.28.5	Agni is as much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, so much he makes it and puts it down.
8.4.2.1.1	Then he puts down the Sprit (bricks).
8.4.2.1.2	This indeed is Prajapati, when he was placed in this (world), all beings were in his womb.
8.4.2.1.3	They are in his womb, sin and death have seized him.
8.4.2.2.1	He said to the gods, "I will free all these beings from sin and death with you."
8.4.2.2.2	What will happen to us then?"
8.4.2.2.3	He said, "Choose."
8.4.2.2.4	Some said, "Let us have a share."
8.4.2.2.5	Some said,
8.4.2.2.6	Having made one part for some, and lordship for others, he touched all beings from sin and death.
8.4.2.2.7	What he touched, therefore, is called Sprita.
8.4.2.2.8	In the same way, the sacrificer, having made one part for others, and lordship for some, touches all beings from sin, from death.
8.4.2.2.9	Therefore, it is said in all (the verses) - "Sprat-sprat".
8.4.2.3.1	"Agni is your share."
8.4.2.3.2	"The lordship of initiation."
8.4.2.3.3	Initiation is indeed speech.
8.4.2.3.4	Having made Agni the share, he made speech the lord.

8.4.3.20.1	He lays down these seventeen bricks.
8.4.3.20.2	The seventeenfold year is Prajapati.
8.4.3.20.3	He is the begetter.
8.4.3.20.4	By means of this seventeenfold year, Prajapati, begetter, generated these creatures.
8.4.3.20.5	What he generated, he created.
8.4.3.20.6-11	The creation that he created, those are the creations. Having created, he brought them to himself. In the same way, the sacrificer, with this seventeenfold year, with Prajapati as the progenitor, generates these creatures. Having created them, he brings them to himself. The two sides are the semen and the urine. The sides are the middle.
8.4.3.20.12	In the middle of it he places these creatures.
8.4.3.20.13	He places them all around.
8.4.3.20.14	In all directions he places these creatures in it.
8.4.4.1.1	Now, then, the Anvarata (bricks).
8.4.4.1.2	He places the Trivrt (bricks) in front,
8.4.4.1.3	the Ekavimsa (bricks) behind, the Pañcadaça (bricks) on the right, and the Saptadaça (bricks) to the left.
8.4.4.2.1-5	Now when Prajapati had placed the Trivrt and Pañcadaśa Stoma, Death approached him. He thought, "I shall seize him here." He saw him. Having gone round him, he placed the Ekavimsa Stoma. Death approached him. Having placed the Pañcadaśas, he placed the Trivṛt. Death approached him.
8.4.4.2.6	Death came to the fifteenfold (verse), he placed it in the seventeenfold (verse).
8.4.4.2.7	He removed death from here, he deluded it here.
8.4.4.2.8	In the same way the sacrificer removes all sins here, he deludes them here.
8.4.4.3.1	Now the northern ones.
8.4.4.3.2	He places the fifteenfold (verses) in the seventeenfold one.
8.4.4.3.3	In the Ekavimsa (Stoma) the Ekavimśa (Stoma).
8.4.4.3.4	In the Pañcadaśa (Stomas) the Saptadaśa (Stotras).
8.4.4.3.5	In the Saptadaśas the Pañcadašas.
8.4.4.3.6	In that he places them in this way, alternating, therefore the Stoma is the Aksnā.
8.4.4.3.7	And because these Stotras are in this way, in a different order, therefore the Stomas are the Aksnā.
8.4.4.3.8	Then the gods, thus, placed it; the Asuras otherwise.
8.4.4.3.9	Then the gods became victorious, the Asuras were defeated.
8.4.4.3.10	He who knows this becomes victorious over his own self, his enemy, his foe.
8.4.4.4.1	This Agni is indeed the animal.
8.4.4.4.2	Here he is completely and entirely made.
8.4.4.4.3	His head is indeed made of three layers.
8.4.4.5.7	Then the Pratiṣṭhā (bricks).
8.4.4.6.1	The two arms are of fifteen (bricks).
8.4.4.6.2	Because they are of fifteen (stones),
8.4.4.6.3	for the arms are of fifteen.
8.4.4.6.4	They are two.
8.4.4.6.5	For these two arms are two.
8.4.4.6.6	He places them on the sides.
8.4.4.6.7	For these arms are on the sides. 
8.4.4.7.1	Food is of seventeen (bricks).
8.4.4.7.2	They are of seventeen (bricks) because food is of seventeen.
8.4.4.7.3	Food is of sevente
8.4.4.7.4	There are two (bricks).
8.4.4.7.5	For food consists of two syllables.
8.4.4.7.6	He lays down the two (bricks) not separated by the fifteen-syllabled (bricks).
8.4.4.7.7	He places food between the two arms.
8.4.4.7.8	The two (bricks) outside are fifteen-syllableds.
8.4.4.7.9	The two inside are seventeen-syllableds between the arms.
8.4.4.7.10	He thus encloses food on both sides.
8.4.4.8.1	Then the one in the middle is the Self.
8.4.4.8.2	He places them in the channels of the semen and blood.
8.4.4.8.3	The semen and blood are the back.
8.4.4.8.4	The back is the middle.
8.4.4.8.5	For this Self is in the middle.
8.4.4.8.6	He places it everywhere.
8.4.4.8.7	For this self is everywhere.
8.4.4.8.8	Then what is left over from that
8.4.4.8.9	Those are the metres of the gods.
8.4.4.8.10	Those are the metres, those are the animals.
8.4.4.8.11	Those are the animals, those are the auspicious ones, those are the Lakṣmīs.
8.4.4.8.12	That is the sun, that is the auspicious one, that is on their right.
8.4.4.9.1	Some place them without interruption with the Trivṛt and Vatsa bricks.
8.4.4.9.2	Those who say that the jaws are the fourteen and the tongue is the six.
8.4.4.9.3	One should not do so.
8.4.4.9.4	They would be exceeding it.
8.4.4.9.5	Just as one would place the later jaws below the earlier jaws, and just as one would place a later tongue below the earlier tongue, so it is.
8.4.4.9.6	Where the head is, there are the jaws, there is the tongue.
8.4.4.10.1	Here some place the intermediate bricks.
8.4.4.10.2	This is the sun.
8.4.4.10.3	"They place him in this direction, saying, 'This is the sun.'"
8.4.4.10.4	One should not do so.
8.4.4.10.5	There are other rites by which he places him here.
8.4.4.11.1	Some place them on the right.
8.4.4.11.2	"These are the auspicious Lakṣmīs, we place them on the right side."
8.4.4.11.3	Therefore, they say of one who has a mark on the right side, "He is auspicious and has Lakṣmī," and of one on the left side of a woman, "He is on the left side."
8.4.4.11.4	Because a woman is on the left.
8.4.4.11.5	That is done.
8.4.4.11.6	One should place it in front.
8.4.4.11.7	Where there is the head, there are the cheeks, and that is the tongue.
8.4.4.11.8	Then these auspicious Lakṣmīs are held in the mouth.
8.4.4.11.9	Therefore, they call him who has Lakṣmī on his face, 'one with auspicious Lakṣmī'.
8.4.4.12.1	This is the Brahma-citī.
8.4.4.12.2	Because it was placed on Brahma, therefore it is Brahma-citī
8.4.4.12.3	This is the Prajapati-citī. 
8.4.4.12.4	Because it was laid on Prajapati, therefore it is Prajapati-citi.
8.4.4.12.5-12	It is the sacrifice of the sages. Because he placed the sages, therefore it is the sacrifice of sages. It is the sacrifice of Vayu. Because he places Vayu, therefore it is Vayu sacrifice. It is Stoma sacrifice. Because he puts Stoma, therefore it is Stoma sacrifice.
8.4.4.12.13	Therefore, whatever he knows, that he should know. Then his sacrificial post becomes endowed with the Rṣeyas and relatives.
8.4.4.12.14	Then he places the Lokamprinā brick on this line.
8.4.4.12.15	Above them is the Bandhu.
8.4.4.12.16	He pours down the dung.
8.4.4.12.17	Above it is the Bandhu
8.5.1.1.1	He places the fifth layer.
8.5.1.1.2	The gods, having built the fourth layer, ascended it.
8.5.1.1.3	They ascended it after having prepared it, which is above the atmosphere and below the heaven.
8.5.1.2.1	They said, "Let us reflect."
8.5.1.2.2	They said, indeed, "We desire the layer. We desire it above."
8.5.1.2.3	They, reflecting, saw the fifth layer of heaven, Viraj.
8.5.1.2.4	This world was given to them.
8.5.1.3.1	They desired: "We shall make this world free from enemies and without affliction."
8.5.1.3.2	They said: "Let us know how we can make this world free of enemies and without affliction.
8.5.1.3.3	They said, "Let us think."
8.5.1.3.4	They said, "Let's think about the foundation."
8.5.1.3.5	"Let us make this world free from enemies and free from harm."
8.5.1.4.1	Thinking, they saw these bricks, free from enemies.
8.5.1.4.2	They placed them.
8.5.1.4.3	With them, they made this world free from enmity and free from harm.
8.5.1.4.4-8	Now, in that they made this world free from enemies and free from injury by means of these (bricks), therefore these are free from enemies. In the same way the sacrificer does so. When he lays down these (bricks), he makes this world free from injury and free from enemies. He lays them down on all sides. He makes this world free of injury and free from foes on all sides.
8.5.1.4.9	He lays down the Parardha (bricks).
8.5.1.4.10	He thus makes this world free from enemies and free from injury.
8.5.1.5.1	Then he lays down the Viraj (bricks).
8.5.1.5.2	This indeed is that Viraj which the gods saw as the fifth layer.
8.5.1.5.3	He lays down ten (bricks) each time.
8.5.1.5.4	The Viraj has ten syllables.
8.5.1.5.5	This is the Viraj layer.
8.5.1.5.6	He places them everywhere.
8.5.1.5.7	He who shines in one direction alone does not shine.
8.5.1.5.8	He who shines in all directions shines.
8.5.1.6.1	He who puts down these bricks without enemies,
8.5.1.6.2	He, indeed, is Prajapati. When he was placed in this (world), he was surrounded by sin from all sides.
8.5.1.6.3	He saw these bricks without enemies.
8.5.1.6.4	He put them down.
8.5.1.6.5	By them he removed that sin.
8.5.1.6.6	Pāpmā is the enemy.
8.5.1.6.7	When they struck away Pāpmā, the enemy, with these (verses),
8.5.1.6.8	then they became free from enemies.
8.5.1.7.1	Now this is done as the gods did it.
8.5.1.7.2	Now this Pāpmā does not afflict him.
8.5.1.7.3	When he does this, he says: 'I do what the gods did.'
8.5.1.7.4	Now, indeed, he strikes with these (verses) the evil one and the enemy.
8.5.1.7.5	In that he strikes with these the evil one and enemy,
8.5.1.7.6	therefore these are not enemies.
8.5.1.7.7	He places them all around.
8.5.1.7.8	He thus strikes the evil one and his enemy on all sides.
8.5.1.7.9	He places (them) in the last half (of the altar).
8.5.1.7.10	He thus removes from himself all evil, all enemies.
8.5.1.8.1	He places it in front, with the verse, "O Agni, drive away our enemies, born before us."
8.5.1.8.2	The arrangement is in accordance with the text of the verse.
8.5.1.8.3	Then behind, with the verse "Drive away our enemies, the born ones, with force."
8.5.1.8.4	The arrangement (of the bricks) is in accordance with this text.
8.5.1.9.1	That which is in front is Agni.
8.5.1.9.2	That is the fire which is at the back.
8.5.1.9.3	He has indeed removed sin from the front with fire, and from the back with fire.
8.5.1.9.4	In the same way the sacrificer removes sin from the front and from the back.
8.5.1.10.1	Then on the right side the Stoma of sixteen verses, Ojas and wealth.
8.5.1.10.2	The Tristubh metre has eleven syllables.
8.5.1.10.3	The Tristubh is the atmosphere and the four directions.
8.5.1.10.4	This very one is the fifteenfold thunderbolt.
8.5.1.10.5	His sun is the sixteenth, the bearer of the thunderbolt.
8.5.1.10.6	He with this fifteenfold thunderbolt and this Tristubh struck down sin from the south.
8.5.1.10.7	In the same way, the sacrificer, with this fifteenfold thunderbolt and this Tristubh (metre), strikes down evil on the right side.
8.5.1.11.1	And on the left side, the forty-four-fold Stoma, the lustre and wealth.
8.5.1.11.2	The Tristubh metre has forty-four syllables.
8.5.1.11.3	The thunderbolt is Tristubh.
8.5.1.11.4	He struck away evil with this forty-four-fold thunderbolt and with this Triṣṭubh verse.
8.5.1.11.5	In the same way the sacrificer strikes away evil with this same forty-four-folded thunderbolt and with this Trisṭubh verse,
8.5.1.12.1	and in the middle of the fire-altar he says, "Thou art the ashes of Agni."
8.5.1.12.2	Brahma is the fourth layer.
8.5.1.12.3	Agni is indeed Brahma.
8.5.1.12.4	This is as if it were the excrement of that (earth).
8.5.1.12.5	The name of that (earth) is Apas.
8.5.1.12.6	Its relation has been stated.
8.5.1.13.1	He places that eastern and oblique (earth) below.
8.5.1.13.2	This is the root of sin which Prajapati cut off with this (earth).
8.5.1.13.3	In the same way, he now cuts off the root of sin with this (earth)
8.5.1.13.4	On the right side.
8.5.1.13.5	The thunderbolt is on the right side.
8.5.1.13.6	The southern direction is in between.
8.5.1.13.7	He makes room for him to rise up.
8.5.1.14.1	The breath that is in front is the Prāṇa.
8.5.1.14.2	The breath which is behind is the Apāna.
8.5.1.14.3	He has removed evil from the front with Prāṇa and from the back with Apāna.
8.5.1.14.4	In the same way, the sacrificer removes evil from the front by Prāṇa and evil from the back by Apāna.
8.5.1.15.1	Then those two arms are the ones on either side of him.
8.5.1.15.2	He struck him with the arms, the sin that was on either side of it.
8.5.1.15.3	In the same way the sacrificer strikes with the arms the sin that is on either side of himself.
8.5.1.16.1	Food is full of excrement.
8.5.1.16.2	He struck with food the sin that was above it.
8.5.1.16.3	In the same way, the sacrificer, by means of food, removes the sin that is above him.
8.5.1.17.1	If he knows this, then when he breathes in, he removes the sin that may be in front of him.
8.5.1.17.2	When he breathes out, he removes the one that may be behind him.
8.5.1.17.3	When with his arms he performs an action, he removes the sins that may be on the sides.
8.5.1.17.4	Then whatever food he eats, that is above him.
8.5.1.17.5	One who knows this always, even while sleeping, destroys sin.
8.5.1.17.6	Therefore one should not proclaim the sin of one who knows this, lest his sin should be transferred to him.
8.5.2.1.1	Then he lays down the Chhandasya brick:
8.5.2.1.2	Prajapati, having been freed from sin and death, desired food.
8.5.2.1.3	Therefore, indeed, he who is afflicted, desiring food, becomes better.
8.5.2.1.4	They hope for him, "He will desire food and live."
8.5.2.1.5	The gods gave him this food, these metres.
8.5.2.1.6	The metres are cattle.
8.5.2.1.7	Cattle are food.
8.5.2.1.8	They gave them to him.
8.5.2.1.9	Because they covered him with them, therefore they are the Chandas.
8.5.2.2.1	He lays them down in groups of ten.
8.5.2.2.2	The Viraj has ten syllables.
8.5.2.2.3	The Viraja is the entire food.
8.5.2.2.4	He thus places the entire food in him.
8.5.2.2.5	He lays it down on all sides.
8.5.2.2.6	He thus puts the entire food in it on all sides. "
8.5.2.3.1	"Thus the Chanda."
8.5.2.3.2	This very world is the Chhandas.
8.5.2.3.3	The Chhandas is called Varivash.
8.5.2.3.4	The Chhanda is called Varivasha.
8.5.2.3.5	The Chanda is called Sambhu.
8.5.2.3.6	The Chhando is called Sambhu
8.5.2.3.7	The Chhandos is called Paribhu.
8.5.2.3.8	The directions are the Chhandos called Paribhu
8.5.2.3.9	The Chhanda called Achacha
8.5.2.3.10	Food is the Chhanda called Achachha
8.5.2.3.11	The Chhanda named Manas
8.5.2.3.12	Prajapati is the Chhanda named Manas
8.5.2.4.10-19	The Udanas are the Trikakup metre. The Kavya is the Chanda. The three Vedas are the Kavya metre. The Angkup is the Chanda (metre). The waters are the Angkup metre. The Aksarapankti is the Chanda metre. The yonder world is the Aksarapankti metre. The Padapankti is the chanda metre. This world is the Padapankti metre.
8.5.2.4.20	The metre is called Vistara-Panka.
8.5.2.4.21	The metre is called Vistāra-Panka. It is the directions.
8.5.2.4.22	The metre called Kshura-Bhrāj.
8.5.2.4.23	The metre Kshura-Bhraj is the sun.
8.5.2.4.24	The metre named Āca and Praca.
8.5.2.4.25	Food is the metre Āca, food is the metre Praca.
8.5.2.5.1	The metre Samya.
8.5.2.5.2	The metre Sanya is the night.
8.5.2.5.3	The Vyāchanda is the Vyāchanda.
8.5.2.5.4	The Vyāchanda indeed is the day.
8.5.2.5.5	The Brhat is the Brhat.
8.5.2.5.6	This indeed is the world.
8.5.2.5.7	The Brhatsanda is the Rathantara.
8.5.2.5.8	This indeed the world.
8.5.2.5.9	Rathantara is the Nikāya.
8.5.2.5.10	The Nikāya indeed is the wind.
8.5.2.5.11	The Vivadha is the Vivadha.
8.5.2.5.12	The Vivādha indeed is the sky.
8.5.2.5.13	The Giri is the Giri.
8.5.2.5.14	Food is the Gīr metre.
8.5.2.5.15	The Bhrāj metre.
8.5.2.5.16	Fire is the Bhrāj metre
8.5.2.5.17	The Samstupa metre.
8.5.2.5.18	The Anushtupa metre.
8.5.2.5.19	Speech is the Samstupa metre
8.5.2.5.20	Speech is the Anushtupa. The Vaśa and Varivāśa metres.
8.5.2.5.21	Its relation has been explained.
8.5.2.6.1	The Vayaś metre.
8.5.2.6.2	Food is the Vayaś metre.
8.5.2.6.3-11	The Vyasakra is the metre. Agni is the Vyasakra metre. The Vishpardha is the metre. The Vishpardha is this world. The Vishala is the metre. This world is the Vishala metre. The Chadi is the metre. Space is the Chadi metre. The Duruhanam is the metre.
8.5.2.7.2	Prāṇa is the first, Vyāna the second, Udāna the third, Udāna the fourth, Vyāna the fifth, Prāṇa the sixth, Prāṇa is seventh.
8.5.2.7.3	Vyāna is eighth, Udāna is ninth, the sacrificer himself is tenth here.
8.5.2.7.4	This sacrificer, having ascended this Viraj, is established in the Prāṇa-form. He places the lower and higher ones.
8.5.2.7.5	Therefore these breaths are both lower and higher.
8.5.2.8.1	Now of those on the right side, the first is Vayu, the second Aditya, the third Aditya, the fourth Vayu, the fifth Agni, the sixth Agni, the seventh Vayu, the eighth Aditya, the ninth is the sacrificer himself, the tenth is the Agnihotra.
8.5.2.8.2	This sacrificer, having been raised up in this Viraj, is established in the divine Viraj. He places the bricks of the lower and upper regions.
8.5.2.8.3	Therefore these gods are the lower and upper ones.
8.5.2.9.1	Now, the worlds which are behind are the first, the second is the atmosphere, the third is heaven, the fourth is the atmosphere, and the fifth is this world, the sixth is this world, and the seventh is the atmosphere, heaven is the eighth, the ninth is the sacrificer himself, and the tenth is here.
8.5.2.9.2	This sacrificer, having ascended this Viraj, is established in the world-pervading (Viraj). He places the bricks going towards the east and the west.
8.5.2.9.3	Therefore these worlds are going towards the east as well as the west.
8.5.2.10.1	Now the seasons beginning with spring are ten in number. The first of them is spring, the second summer, the third autumn, the fourth winter, the fifth winter, the sixth spring, the seventh spring, the eighth autumn, the ninth winter, and the tenth is the Sacrificer.
8.5.2.10.2	This sacrificer, having ascended this Viraj, is established in the seasonal (bricks). He places the bricks of the lower and upper directions.
8.5.2.10.3	Therefore these seasons are lower and upper.
8.5.2.11.1	Then again he places those which are in front. They are the breaths.
8.5.2.11.2	They are ten in number.
8.5.2.11.3	There are ten breaths.
8.5.2.11.4	He places them in the eastern half.
8.5.2.11.5	The Prāṇas are in front.
8.5.2.12.1	The deities who are on the right side are Agni, Earth, Wind, Space, Sun, Heaven, Moon, Stars, Food, and Water.
8.5.2.13.1	The deities in the rear are the four directions, the four intermediate directions, the upward direction, and this direction.
8.5.2.14.1	Now the months that are to the north of the equator are the two spring months, the two summer months, the two rainy months, the two autumn months, the two winter months.
8.5.2.15.1	Now again, the first of the ten is this world, the second is the atmosphere, the third is heaven.
8.5.2.15.2	Ascending this world with the first ten, the atmosphere with the second, heaven with the third.
8.5.2.16.6	Therefore, just as the first one has ten, so does the last one.
8.5.2.16.7	Because this is the same.
8.5.2.16.8	This world is the same as those ten.
8.5.2.17.1	Those are forty bricks and forty formulas.
8.5.2.17.2	That is eighty.
8.5.2.17.3	Eighty is food.
8.5.2.17.4	Whatever he says, he gives it to him, having made it food.
8.5.2.17.5	He pleases him with that.
8.5.3.1.1	Then he lays down the Stomabhāga bricks.
8.5.3.1.2	This indeed is the food of Prajapati. Indra meditated on this.
8.5.3.1.3	He wanted to step out from it.
8.5.3.1.4	He said to him, "Why are you stepping out?"
8.5.3.1.5	"Why do you abandon me?"
8.5.3.1.6	"He (Agni) will give me the taste of this food."
8.5.3.1.7	"Come and join me with it."
8.5.3.1.8	"So be it."
8.5.3.1.9	He gave him the taste of that food, and he joined him with it.
8.5.3.2.1	He who was that Prajapati, is indeed this Agni who is being built up.
8.5.3.2.2	And that food which was that, are indeed these metres.
8.5.3.2.3	Now that which is the taste of food, those are the Stoma Bhagas.
8.5.3.2.4	Now that which is Indra, that is the sun.
8.5.3.2.5	This is indeed the Stoma.
8.5.3.2.6	For whatever one may praise, one praises him by that.
8.5.3.2.7	Therefore he gave this portion to this Stoma.
8.5.3.2.8	Because he gave this share to this Stoma, therefore they are called Stomabhāgas.
8.5.3.3.1	"He wins truth with the ray, with the truth."
8.5.3.3.2	This indeed is the ray, food.
8.5.3.3.3	He wins the ray and its taste and brings them into himself.
8.5.3.3.4	"He conquers the law with the law."
8.5.3.3.5	This indeed, is the law, food.
8.5.3.3.6-10	Praiti, having united this and that taste, makes it enter the self. "Anviti, having united this, makes it enter into the self. "He who is Anviti, he is food." "Anviti, uniting this and that taste together, makes it enter in the self. "'''What he says here, that is Anviti." "Having united this and that, makes it enter within the self. ". "With this, O God, do thou nourish me. "For thee, O God,
8.5.3.3.11	He enlivens the two lords of food.
8.5.3.3.12	They are divided into three parts.
8.5.3.3.13	Food is divided into three parts,
8.5.3.4.1	Whatever Stoma-shares he places,
8.5.3.4.2	The gods, having built the Viraj-altar, ascended it.
8.5.3.4.3	They said, "Let us think."
8.5.3.4.4	They said, indeed, "Let us build the altar."
8.5.3.4.5	And those who were thinking saw only the heaven, the world of heaven, and they placed it.
8.5.3.4.6	That which is the heaven, the heaven of heaven, these are the Stomabhāga (bricks).
8.5.3.4.7	In that he places these (bricks), he places only the heaven, world of heaven.
8.5.3.5.1	Those three which are the first, this is the world.
8.5.3.5.2	Those which are the second, that is the atmosphere.
8.5.3.5.3	Those which the third, that is the sky.
8.5.3.5.4	The quarters which are the fourth are the east.
8.5.3.5.5	The quarters which are the fifth are the south.
8.5.3.5.6	The quarters that are the sixth are the west.
8.5.3.5.7	The quarters are the seventh are the north.
8.5.3.6.1	These twenty-one bricks are these worlds and the directions.
8.5.3.6.2	These worlds and the directions are the foundation.
8.5.3.6.3	These worlds, the directions, are twenty-one.
8.5.3.6.4	Therefore they say, 'The foundation is twenty-one.'
8.5.3.7.1	Now those eight bricks which are left over.
8.5.3.7.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
8.5.3.7.3	Brahma is the Gayatri.
8.5.3.7.4	That which is Brahma, this is that which shines in this circle.
8.5.3.7.5	It shines established in this twenty-one-fold foundation.
8.5.3.7.6	Therefore it does not fall.
8.5.3.8.1	They put down the thirty-third verse, "May that be your glory, may it generate the kingdom for the kingdom."
8.5.3.8.2	The Viraj has thirty syllables.
8.5.3.8.3	This is the Viraj sacrifice.
8.5.3.8.4	One should not do so.
8.5.3.8.5	They exceed you by one-twenty-one. Then the Gayatri, then the world of Indra, which is less than this.
8.5.3.8.6	Viraj.
8.5.3.8.7	They make Indra the enemy of his foe in the world of Indra.
8.5.3.8.8	They drive Indra to the world of Indra
8.5.3.8.9	The sacrificer is Indra in his own sacrifice.
8.5.3.8.10	They make the sacrificer the enemy of his foes in the world of the sacrificer.
8.5.3.8.11	The sacrificer and the world of the sacrificer are pushed away by those who bring this Agni.
8.5.3.8.12	This very sacrificer is in the place of the sacrificer. He is the thirtieth here.
8.5.4.1.1	He places it in the place of Ashadha.
8.5.4.1.2	Ashadha is speech.
8.5.4.1.3	This is the sap.
8.5.4.1.4	He places the sap in speech.
8.5.4.1.5	Therefore, of all the limbs, speech alone knows the sap of food.
8.5.4.2.1	What is the reason for the Aṣāḍha?
8.5.4.2.2	This is the Aṣādha.
8.5.4.2.3	This is the Stomabhāga.
8.5.4.2.4	He establishes that Aditya in this foundation.
8.5.4.3.1	What is the reason for Aṣāḍhā?
8.5.4.3.2	This is Aṣāḍhī.
8.5.4.3.3	This is Stomabhāgā.
8.5.4.3.4	He places the heart and mind in this.
8.5.4.3.5	Therefore one thinks with the heart and mind here.
8.5.4.3.6	He places it everywhere.
8.5.4.3.7	He places the heart and mind everywhere.
8.5.4.3.8	Therefore, he thinks with his heart and mind everywhere in this (world).
8.5.4.3.9	And these are indeed auspicious marks.
8.5.4.3.10	He places them everywhere.
8.5.4.3.11	Therefore they say of him whose marks are everywhere that he is auspicious.
8.5.4.4.1	Then he covers them with dung.
8.5.4.6.4	The heart is the city, and it covers it.
8.5.4.7.1	What is covered with excrement.
8.5.4.7.2	This Agni is a year.
8.5.4.7.3	He covers it with the bricks and excrement.
8.5.4.7.4	Those four are the four seasons.
8.5.4.7.5	Then having placed the Stomabhāga, he pours down the excrement.
8.5.4.7.6	That is the fifth layer.
8.5.4.7.7	That is the fifth season.
8.5.4.8.1	They say, "If the other bricks are Lokamprana (i.e. bricks which fill the world) then here one does not put the Lokamprana brick."
8.5.4.8.2	Where is the Lokamprana?
8.5.4.8.3	The sun is the Lokampraṇa.
8.5.4.8.4	This is the Lokampranā brick.
8.5.4.8.5	This is a Lokamprana brick by itself.
8.5.4.8.6	Now what is above that and below the excrement, that is the sixth layer, that is the seventh season.
8.5.4.9.1	Then he pours down the excrement.
8.5.4.9.2	There he places the Vikarni.
8.5.4.9.3	He sprinkles with pieces of gold.
8.5.4.9.4	He places Agni.
8.5.4.9.5	That is the seventh layer.
8.5.4.9.6	That is seventh season.
8.5.4.10.1	They are indeed six only.
8.5.4.10.2	For the Vikarni and Svayamatriti are indeed the sixth layer of the fire altar.
8.5.4.11.1	They are indeed five.
8.5.4.11.2	In other layers one pours down the soil with a formula.
8.5.4.11.3	Here one does not do so.
8.5.4.11.4	Therefore this is not a layer.
8.5.4.11.5	And other layers end with the Lokamprinas.
8.5.4.11.6	Here one pours down the Lokamprinastobha.
8.5.4.11.7	Therefore this also is not a layer.
8.5.4.12.1	They are indeed three only.
8.5.4.12.2	This world is the first layer.
8.5.4.12.3	The sky is the last.
8.5.4.12.4	And those three are the atmosphere.
8.5.4.12.5	This atmosphere is indeed one only.
8.5.4.12.6	They are thus three, five, six, seven.
8.6.1.1.1	He places the Nakṣatras.
8.6.1.1.2	The Nakṣatras are the gods.
8.6.1.1.3	Here this entire Agni is prepared.
8.6.1.1.4	This is the heaven, the world of heaven, the world.
8.6.1.1.5	The gods sat down in it.
8.6.1.1.6	In that the gods sat down in this heaven, the world, therefore the gods are called 'sitters in heaven'.
8.6.1.1.7	In the same way the sacrificer now sits down in this heaven and world of heaven when he lays down these (bricks).
8.6.1.2.1	In that he lays down the 'Sitters in Heaven' (bricks),
8.6.1.2.2-6	The gods saw this heaven, this world of heaven, these Stomabhāga hymns. They said, "Let us know how we may dwell in this heaven, this heavenly world." They said, “Let us reflect.” They said, indeed, “Let us think about it.” They thought, “How may we dwell in this heaven this heavenly world?”
8.6.1.3.1	And they, reflecting, saw these bricks, the 'dwellers in heaven'.
8.6.1.3.2	They laid them down.
8.6.1.3.3	By means of them they settled down in this heaven, in the world of heaven.
8.6.1.3.4	In that they settled down by means of them in this heaven, the world of heaven, therefore they are the 'dwellers of heaven'.
8.6.1.3.5	and in the same way the sacrificer places these (bricks) here, in that heaven, in that world of heaven.
8.6.1.3.6	He settles down.
8.6.1.4.1	He places the bricks in the directions.
8.6.1.4.2	The directions are the heaven, the world of heaven. Here he settles them in the heaven, in the world of heaven, in the directions. He places them in the directions. The directions are the heaven.
8.6.1.4.3	Here he settles them in heaven, in the heaven, the heaven, the directions.
8.6.1.4.4	By the time of the Rtuvyas.
8.6.1.4.5	The Rtuvyas are the year.
8.6.1.4.6	The year is the heaven, the heavenly world.
8.6.1.4.7	He thus places them in heaven itself.
8.6.1.4.8	The Antastoma part.
8.6.1.4.9	This indeed is the heaven, the world of heaven.
8.6.1.4.10	He thus establishes them in that very (heaven).
8.6.1.5.1	He places it in front,
8.6.1.5.2	saying, 'The queen is the eastern direction.'
8.6.1.5.3	For the eastern direction is indeed called 'queen'.
8.6.1.5.4	'The Vasus are your presiding deities.'
8.6.1.5.5	The Vasus are the gods who rule over this direction.
8.6.1.5.6	"Agni is the protector of the frightened."
8.6.1.5.7	Agni indeed is the protector of those who are frightened here.
8.6.1.5.8	"May the three-fold Stoma be established on earth for thee."
8.6.1.5.9	This is indeed established on earth by the three-fold stoma.
8.6.1.5.10	"May ghee be established for praise and stability."
8.6.1.5.11	With ghee, this is the Uktha for invincibility.
8.6.1.5.12	The Rathantara Saman is established on earth, in the firmament.
8.6.1.5.13	This is the Rathantara Saman, established in the firmament, the sages are your firstborn among the gods.
8.6.1.5.14	The sages are the firstborn among the vital airs.
8.6.1.5.15	That indeed is the firstborn Brahman.
8.6.1.5.16	"May they extend as far as the extent of heaven."
8.6.1.5.17	"May they extend as much as the extent of the sky."
8.6.1.5.18	This is the creator and the lord.
8.6.1.5.19	Speech and mind.
8.6.1.5.20	For they both support this entire (universe).
8.6.1.5.21	May all of them, having agreed, place you, the sacrificer, on the back of heaven, in the heavenly world."
8.6.1.5.22	As is the Yajus, so is the Bandhu.
8.6.1.6.1	Then on the right side, "You are Viraj, the southern direction."
8.6.1.6.2	This is the southern direction named Viraj.
8.6.1.6.3	The Rudras are your gods, the rulers."
8.6.1.6.4	The Rudras indeed are the gods of this direction, the rulers.
8.6.1.6.5	Indra is the repeller of obstacles."
8.6.1.6.6	Indra indeed is the repeller here of obstacles.
8.6.1.6.7	"May the fifteen-fold Stoma be established in the earth."
8.6.1.6.8	Indeed, this earth is established by the fifteen-fold stoma.
8.6.1.6.9	"May the Prauga hymn be established for the sake of stability."
8.6.1.6.10	Indeed, the earth is stabilized by the Prauga hymn for the sake of firmness.
8.6.1.6.11	"May Brihat Sama be established for the purpose of stability in the atmosphere."
8.6.1.6.12	This is the great hymn, established in the atmosphere.
8.6.1.6.13	The sages are your firstborn among the gods.
8.6.1.6.14	Its relation has been explained.
8.6.1.7.1	Then afterwards, "You are the emperor, the western direction."
8.6.1.7.2	This is the direction named "emperor" and "western."
8.6.1.7.3	The Adityas are your presiding deities.
8.6.1.7.4	The Adityadevas are the presiding deities of this direction.
8.6.1.7.5	Varuna is the guardian of the oblations.
8.6.1.7.6	Varuna indeed is the guardian of oblations here.
8.6.1.7.7	May the Stoma of seventeen verses be established on the earth.
8.6.1.7.8	This earth is indeed established by the Stoma of seven- teen verses.
8.6.1.7.9	May the Marutvatiya hymn be established for the unshakable.
8.6.1.7.10	This earth has been established by the Marutvati- ya hymn for the unshakable.
8.6.1.7.11	The Vairūpa Sāman is established in the Antarikṣa region.
8.6.1.7.12	This Sāman is indeed established in the Antariksa region by means of the Vairūpa.
8.6.1.7.13	The sages are your firstborn among the gods.
8.6.1.7.14	Its relation has been explained.
8.6.1.8.1	Then to the north, the lord of sound, the northern direction.
8.6.1.8.2	This is the northern direction named 'lord of sound'.
8.6.1.8.3	The Maruts are your presiding deities.
8.6.1.8.4	The Maruts are the gods who rule over this direction.
8.6.1.8.5	Soma is the protector of the distressed.
8.6.1.8.6	Soma indeed is the protector of those in distress here.
8.6.1.8.7	May the twenty-one-fold Stoma be established on earth.
8.6.1.8.8	This (earth) is indeed established on the twenty-onefold Stoma.
8.6.1.8.9	May the praise be established for the sake of invincibility.
8.6.1.8.10	This is the Uktha of the Nishkalya, fixed on the earth for non-injury.
8.6.1.8.11	The Vairāja Sāman is fixed on the sky for stability.
8.6.1.8.12	This is the Vairāja Sâman, fixed on the sky.
8.6.1.8.13	The sages have made you the firstborn among the gods.
8.6.1.8.14	Its relationship has been explained.
8.6.1.9.1	Then in the middle, you are the lord of the great direction.
8.6.1.9.2	This is the name of the Aditi direction.
8.6.1.9.3	The All-Gods are the rulers of that direction.
8.6.1.9.4	The gods of that direction are the rulers.
8.6.1.9.5	Brihaspati is the protector of the Hatis.
8.6.1.9.6	Brihaspatirat is indeed the protector of the Hatls here.
8.6.1.9.7	May the Stoma of Trinava and Trayastrimsa be established in the earth.
8.6.1.9.8	This is the Uktha of the Visve Devas and Agni and Maruts, which is fixed for the earth by the two Ukthas of thirty-nine and thirty-three.
8.6.1.9.9	"It is said, "The Ukthas of the Visve Devās and Agni and Marut are fixed for the earth."
8.6.1.9.10	This is the Sāman of the Śākyas and Raivatas, which is fixed in the firmament by the two Ukthās of thirty-nine
8.6.1.9.11	and thirty-three.
8.6.1.9.12	This is established in the atmosphere by the Sāma hymns of Śākvara and Raivata.
8.6.1.9.13	The sages have placed you among the gods as the firstborn.
8.6.1.9.14	Its relationship has been explained.
8.6.1.10.1	This much is the entire sacrifice.
8.6.1.10.2	The sacrifice is the self of the gods.
8.6.1.10.3	Having made the sacrifice their self, the gods settled in this heavenly world.
8.6.1.11.6	The Hotr is indeed something extra.
8.6.1.11.7	The crown is also something extra.
8.6.1.11.8	It is because it is fivefold that it is extra.
8.6.1.11.9	Therefore, the crown is fivefold.
8.6.1.12.1	When he places the fivefold crown,
8.6.1.12.2	the self is the fivefold crown.
8.6.1.12.3	The fivefold crown is a pair.
8.6.1.12.4	Half of the self is a pair.
8.6.1.12.5	When the two are together, then all, then the whole.
8.6.1.12.6	For the sake of completeness.
8.6.1.13.1	When he places the Nakṣatras and Pañcaśīrṣa,
8.6.1.13.2	the Nakṣatras are the Self,
8.6.1.13.3	and Pañcaśirṣa is the offspring.
8.6.1.13.4	What is in excess of the Self is the offspring. What is in excess is the crest.
8.6.1.13.5	What is the excess of five?
8.6.1.14.6	The directions are indeed more than the sun.
8.6.1.14.7	The directions are indeed more.
8.6.1.14.8	The crest is indeed more.
8.6.1.14.9	Because there are five more,
8.6.1.14.10	therefore they have five crests.
8.6.1.15.1	And because he places five crests,
8.6.1.15.2	The gods were afraid of this, thinking, "May the Rakshas and the Asuras not destroy these worlds from above."
8.6.1.15.3	They made these (gods) the protectors of these worlds from above, namely the Hetas and the Prahejas.
8.6.1.15.4	In the same way, the sacrificer makes these (bricks) the protectors of these worlds from above, which are the Hetayas and Prahetayas.
8.6.1.16.1	He places it in front (of the fire-altar).
8.6.1.16.2	This is the Puruharika (brick).
8.6.1.16.3	Agni is in front.
8.6.1.16.4	When he says this, he says, 'Puruharika'.
8.6.1.16.5	They take Agni in the eastern direction, they attend to him in the eastern direction.
8.6.1.16.6	Then why does he say, 'Harikeśa'?
8.6.1.16.7	Because Agni is like Hari, like the rays of the sun.
8.6.1.16.8	Because the rays of Agni are like the rays of Surya.
8.6.1.16.9	Rathāgnī and Rathāuja are the commanders of the army and the village.
8.6.1.16.10	Those two are the spring seasons.
8.6.1.16.11	Punjikasthala and Kratusthala are the celestial nymphs.
8.6.1.16.12-16	The Mahitthi said, "The directions and the sub-directions." The army and the assembly. The animals are the targets, the human killing is the target. What is targeted in the army and the assembly are the animals, the target is the human killing.
8.6.1.16.17	The killing of one another is the killing of men.
8.6.1.16.18	To them be salutations.
8.6.1.16.19	He offers salutations to them alone.
8.6.1.16.20	May they be kind to us.
8.6.1.16.21	They alone are kind to him.
8.6.1.16.22	Whom we hate and who hates us, we place him in their jaws.
8.6.1.16.23	He puts him in the jaws of him whom he hates and who hates him.
8.6.1.16.24	One should say, "I put him in the jaws."
8.6.1.16.25	Then there is no more of him.
8.6.1.16.26	One may not even care for that.
8.6.1.16.27	For he who knows this puts himself in the jaws of the one he hates.
8.6.1.17.1	Then to the right.
8.6.1.17.2	This is the southern wind, the creator of all.
8.6.1.17.3	This is the wind, the creator, which blows here.
8.6.1.17.4	For he creates all this.
8.6.1.17.5	And because he is called the southern wind,
8.6.1.17.6	therefore he blows mostly from the south.
8.6.1.17.7	His charioteer is Rathasvana and his painter is Rathashcitra.
8.6.1.17.8	These are the two seasons of summer.
8.6.1.17.9	Menakā and Sahājanī are the two celestial nymphs.
8.6.1.17.10	The directions and the sub-directions are said to be the two.
8.6.1.17.11	These are the heaven and earth.
8.6.1.17.12	The demons, the demons, the demons and the demons are said to be.
8.6.1.17.13	The demons are the demons, the Rākṣasas are the demons.
8.6.1.17.14	Let there be salutations to them.
8.6.1.17.15	His relationship has been told.
8.6.1.18.1	Now after that.
8.6.1.18.2	This is the one who is behind the all-pervading sky.
8.6.1.18.3	This is the sun, which is all-pervader.
8.6.1.18.4	For when he rises, then this entire world becomes pervaded.
8.6.1.18.5	And because he says, "behind,"
8.6.1.18.6	therefore they see him going towards the west.
8.6.1.18.7	His charioteer is Prāta and his commander-in-chief is Senāni.
8.6.1.18.8	The two seasons of the rainy season.
8.6.1.18.9	The two Apsarases are Pramlocanta and Anumlocanta.
8.6.1.18.10	The two directions are Dik and Upadiks, so says Maahitthi.
8.6.1.18.11	The two seasons are day and night.
8.6.1.18.12	They are called Pramlocanta because they are seen in the morning and Anumlochanta because they are not seen in the evening.
8.6.1.18.13	The two animals are tiger and snake.
8.6.1.18.14	The tiger is the animal here, and the snake is the animal there.
8.6.1.19.8-13	His commanders were Tarkshya and Charistnemi. The two seasons of autumn are the Apsarases Visvavasu and Ghritachi. Mahatthi said that the directions are Dik and Upadiks. The Veda is your ladle. The Veda itself is Visvavasu, and the ladle is Ghritachi. The waters are Heti, and the wind is Praheti.
8.6.1.19.14	Water is the wind that blows here. Wind is the wind that is blowing.
8.6.1.19.15	From here the wind blows hot.
8.6.1.19.16	From here it blows cold.
8.6.1.19.17	To them be salutations.
8.6.1.19.18	His relation has been stated.
8.6.1.20.1	Now in the middle.
8.6.1.20.2	This is above, below, and in the middle. This is above, below and in the middle,
8.6.1.20.3	Parjanya is above.
8.6.1.20.4	That he says above.
8.6.1.20.5	Parjanya is indeed above.
8.6.1.20.6	Then as to why it is called "the world of the gods."
8.6.1.20.7	For from that time on the rain and food are given to the creatures.
8.6.1.20.8	And Senajit and Susena were the commanders-in-chief.
8.6.1.20.9	Those two are the winter seasons.
8.6.1.20.10	And Urvashi and Purukutsa were the celestial nymphs.
8.6.1.20.11	And the directions and the sub-directions, so said Mahtthi.
8.6.1.20.12	The oblation and the Dakṣiṇā are yours.
8.6.1.20.13	The thunderbolt and the lightning are the two missiles.
8.6.1.20.14	The thunderbolt is indeed the missile here, and the lightning is the second missile.
8.6.1.20.15	To them be salutations.
8.6.1.20.16	His relationship has been explained.
8.6.1.21.1	These are indeed the two missiles.
8.6.1.21.2	The gods made them the protectors of these worlds above. Those are the Senani-Gramaniyas.
8.6.1.21.3	And that pair became the Apsarases.
8.6.1.21.4	All the gods, having become complete, with offspring and with the pair, settled in this heaven, in the world of heaven.
8.6.1.21.5	In the same way the sacrificer.
8.6.1.21.6	All of them, having become complete, with offspring and with the pair, rest in this heaven, in the world of heaven.
8.6.1.22.1	Those ten bricks are indeed placed.
8.6.1.22.2	The Viraj has ten syllables.
8.6.1.22.3	This is the Viraj-citi.
8.6.1.22.4	They are indeed five.
8.6.1.22.5	For he places two-two.
8.6.1.22.6	These are indeed Agni's blessings.
8.6.1.22.7	He places them in the last layer.
8.6.1.22.8	This is the end of Agni's altar.
8.6.1.22.9	He thus places the blessings of Agni at the end.
8.6.1.22.10	There are five (bricks).
8.6.1.22.11	For the blessings of the sacrifice are five.
8.6.1.22.12	Then he puts the clay between them.
8.6.1.22.13	For these two bricks are Agni. Lest these two fires should be distressed.
8.6.1.22.14	And clay is food.
8.6.1.22.15	He makes it known by means of food alone.
8.6.1.23.1	Now, then, the Anvarata (bricks).
8.6.1.23.2	Having placed it in front, he places it on the right, then behind, then on the left, then in the middle.
8.6.1.23.3	Then the northern ones.
8.6.1.23.4	Having placed the first one in front, he then places it on the left, in the middle, then on the right, and then behind.
8.6.1.23.5	The western foot is indeed the heavenly world.
8.6.2.1.5	Because he was not able to bear that prosperity, they say even now, "He is not able to bear prosperity, kingship, or the office of a village chief."
8.6.2.1.6	The gods gave him this prosperity and these metres.
8.6.2.1.7	Cattle are the metres.
8.6.2.1.8	Food is cattle.
8.6.2.1.9	Food is prosperity.
8.6.2.2.1	He places three (bricks) in the middle.
8.6.2.2.2	The three-fold is the animal, the father, the mother, the son.
8.6.2.2.3	And the embryo, the egg, the placenta.
8.6.2.2.4	And the three-fold is food, agriculture, rain, seed.
8.6.2.2.5	There is only one Atichandas.
8.6.2.2.6	For she alone exceeds all the metres.
8.6.2.2.7	That which is that glory, that is the great praise.
8.6.2.2.8	And that which is that great praise, those are the metres.
8.6.2.3.1	His head is of the Gāyatrī metre.
8.6.2.3.2	The body is of the Tristubh metre, the neck of the Jagatī metre, the wings of the Pankti metre.
8.6.2.3.3	Then taking four four syllables each from these directions, he places them in the Atichandas.
8.6.2.3.4	It becomes of the Atichandas metre.
8.6.2.3.5	The others are completed by the Gāyatrīs.
8.6.2.3.6	That itself is the Gāyatry of eighty syllables.
8.6.2.3.7	The Brihatī verses are the Barhaspatya verses.
8.6.2.3.8	The Ushnih verses are the Sauṣṇihī verses.
8.6.2.3.9	The Vasha, the Ardharcha, the Indra-Agni, and the Avarpana verses are the Atichandas verses.
8.6.2.3.10	The Nadas, the Sudodhas, the Padanushangas, and whatever Anuṣṭup verses there are here, are the Anuṣṭubh verses.
8.6.2.4.1	The Dvipada verses are the Pratiṣṭha verses.
8.6.2.4.2	This is the extent of the great praise.
8.6.2.5.3	When they entered, Prajapati entered as the best.
8.6.2.5.4	He who is Prajapati, these are the metres.
8.6.2.6.1	His head is the Gāyatrī verses.
8.6.2.6.2	Because they are Gāyatrī,
8.6.2.6.3	the head is Gāyatrī. There are three,
8.6.2.6.4	because the head is threefold.
8.6.2.6.5	He places it in the eastern half,
8.6.2.6.6	because the east is the head.
8.6.2.7.1	The chest is the Tristubh verses,
8.6.2.7.2	He places the Retahsiras (seed-shedding) bricks in the Velya (space).
8.6.2.7.3	The Retahsiras are the back-bones.
8.6.2.7.4	The back-bones are the chest.
8.6.2.8.1	The loins are the Jagatls.
8.6.2.8.2	He places the Jagatls as far as the Svayamatrma (brick) is placed in front.
8.6.2.8.3	This is the Svayamatrna (brick) which is the vital air in the middle.
8.6.2.8.4	As much as there is in front of this Prāṇa, so much is behind the hips.
8.6.2.9.1	The thighs are Anushtubh.
8.6.2.9.2	He places them without interruption from the Jagatīs.
8.6.2.9.3	He places the thighs without interruption from the hips.
8.6.2.10.1	Parshus are Brihatī.
8.6.2.10.2	Kikasa are Kakubha.
8.6.2.10.3	He places the Tristubh and Kakubha verses between the Brihatis.
8.6.2.10.4	Therefore the shoulders here are bound on both sides, at the joints and at the ribs.
8.6.2.11.1	The neck is the Ushnih verses.
8.6.2.11.2	He places them without interruption to the Gayatri verses.
8.6.2.11.3	He thus places the neck in the head without interruption.
8.6.2.12.1	The wings are the Pankti verses.
8.6.2.13.2-7	The Chhandas are the animals. Animals are food. The stomach eats food. For the stomach eats food. Therefore, when the stomach gets food, then it is eaten and becomes a form of what has been consumed and exhausted. Since it eats the animals, the Chhandas, therefore it is called Attichhandas.
8.6.2.13.8	They call it the 'Atti-chanda' because of its being the 'Atti chanda'.
8.6.2.13.9	The gods desire the 'Paro-aksam'.
8.6.2.14.1	The womb is the one with excrement.
8.6.2.14.2	He places them touching each other.
8.6.2.14.3	For the belly and the womb are touching each other. They are joined together.
8.6.2.14.4	They are joined together. The belly and the womb.
8.6.2.14.5	Excrement is flesh.
8.6.2.14.6	The belly and the womb, they are joined together by flesh.
8.6.2.15.6	The heart is the highest, the belly is the next, and the womb is the lowest.
8.6.2.16.1	He places them on the right side of the naturally-perforated stone.
8.6.2.16.2	Then on the first layer of the naturally-perfo-rated stone, he places the belly and the womb on the left side.
8.6.2.16.3	The breath in the middle is this naturally-perforated (stone).
8.6.2.16.4	He places the belly and womb on both sides of that breath.
8.6.2.18.2	Now he who makes his self thus well-done, he indeed attains a well-done self.
8.6.2.18.3	But he who makes his Self otherwise than this, he indeed makes his Self ill-done.
8.6.2.18.4	He indeed attains an ill-done Self.
8.6.2.19.1	These are the two verses on the Self.
8.6.2.19.2	The Sun is the highest light of the gods. The gods are the highest light of Surya.
8.6.2.19.3	This indeed is the highest light among the gods. Prajapati entered it last.
8.6.2.19.4	Therefore he says, "The Sun is the highest heaven of the gods."
8.6.2.19.5	And when he says, "the gods are the highest heaven of Surya,"
8.6.2.19.6	this Agni is Surya.
8.6.2.19.7	All the gods are established in that highest layer of him.
8.6.2.19.8	Therefore, they say, "The gods are in the highest heaven of the sun."
8.6.3.1.1	He lays down the Garhapatya.
8.6.3.1.2	The gods, having attained this, thought, "We have succeeded."
8.6.3.1.3	They said, "By what did we succeed?"
8.6.3.1.4	They said, "By the Garhapaty alone."
8.6.3.1.5	Having built the Garhapatya fire, we saw the first layer on it. We saw the second layer on the first, the third on the second, the fourth on the third, and the fifth on the fourth. This is the fifth.
8.6.3.2.1	They said, "Know this, so that this prosperity may be ours."
8.6.3.2.2	They said, "Let us think."
8.6.3.2.3	They said, "We want to think."
8.6.3.2.4	They thought, "May this be so that we may prosper."
8.6.3.3.1	Thinking, they saw this and said, "Let's bring him here and place him."
8.6.3.3.2	They brought him here and placed him.
8.6.3.3.3	In that (place) the Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas, the Maruts, the Visve Devas, and the All-gods placed (the bricks) saying, "We place here, we place here."
8.6.3.4.1	They said, "We shall place it in the middle itself."
8.6.3.4.2	"He will be placed in the middle of all of us."
8.6.3.4.3	They placed it in the middle.
8.6.3.4.4	They placed this attainment in themselves.
8.6.3.4.5	in the middle.
8.6.3.4.6	In the middle indeed they placed this prosperity in themselves.
8.6.3.4.7	In the same way the sacrificer places the Garhapatya.
8.6.3.4.8	In this way he places this prosperity in himself.
8.6.3.4.9	In the centre.
8.6.3.4.10	In the very centre he places this prosperity.
8.6.3.5.1	In that he places the Garha-patya,
8.6.3.5.2	The Garhapatya is food.
8.6.3.5.3	This fire is kindled for food.
8.6.3.5.4	He places food in food.
8.6.3.5.5	In the middle.
8.6.3.5.6	He places the food in the middle of it.
8.6.3.6.1	When he places the Garhapatya,
8.6.3.6.2	the altar is the world of the gods.
8.6.3.6.3	And this one is kindled outside the altar.
8.6.3.6.4	When he places it here, he establishes him in the world of the gods.
8.6.3.7.1	When he places the Gārhapatya,
8.6.3.7.2	the lotus leaf is the womb.
8.6.3.7.3	But it is also outside the womb.
8.6.3.7.4	The fire ritual outside the womb is before the lotus leaf.
8.6.3.7.5	When he places it here, having brought it, he establishes it in the womb, in the lotus leaf.
8.6.3.7.6	Thus indeed, it becomes outside.
8.6.3.7.7	He places eight bricks.
8.6.3.7.8	Its relation is stated.
8.6.3.7.9	He constructs it with these very mantras, with this covering.
8.6.3.7.10	He who is this
8.6.3.7.11	He puts it down here, having brought it from there.
8.6.3.8.1	He then puts down the fire-wood for the Garhapatya.
8.6.3.8.2	The gods, having piled up the Garhapaty a fire, did not see prosperity in it.
8.6.3.8.3	The Garhapatya fire is the womb.
8.6.3.8.4	The seed and propagation are the prosperity of the womb.
8.6.3.8.5	They did not see the seed and propagation in that womb.
8.6.3.9.1	They said, "Let us know how to place the semen in this womb for procreation."
8.6.3.9.2	They said, "Let's think about it."
8.6.3.9.3	They said just that.
8.6.3.9.4	"Let us think about how to place the seed in this womb for reproduction."
8.6.3.10.1	While thinking, they saw this again.
8.6.3.10.2	They placed it.
8.6.3.10.3-8	They placed the semen in this womb for procreation. In the middle. They placed the semen in the middle of this womb for progeneration. In the same way, the sacrificer places the covering bricks. He places the semen in this very womb for procreation.
8.6.3.10.9	In the middle of the womb he places the semen and procreation.
8.6.3.11.1	Some place it in the middle of the buttocks.
8.6.3.11.2	From the middle of the buttock the semen is emitted, at the junction of the tail.
8.6.3.11.3	From the tail the semen is emitted.
8.6.3.11.4	One should not do so.
8.6.3.11.5	Those who do so place the semen and progeneration outside the womb.
8.6.3.11.6	One should place it in the centre.
8.6.3.11.7	Now he places the semen in the womb.
8.6.3.12.1	He places eight bricks.
8.6.3.12.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
8.6.3.12.3	Agni is Gayatri.
8.6.3.12.4	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with that much he thus pours him down as semen.
8.6.3.12.5	He settles it five times.
8.6.3.12.6	Agni has five layers.
8.6.3.12.7	The year has five seasons.
8.6.3.12.8	The year is Agni.
8.6.3.12.9	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with that much he pours the semen into him, made into that.
8.6.3.12.10	He lays down eight bricks five times.
8.6.3.12.11	That makes thirteen.
8.6.3.12.12	Thirteen months are a year.
8.6.3.12.13	Thirteen are the heaps of Agni's bricks.
8.6.3.12.14	As much as Agni, as much as his measure.
8.6.3.12.15	That much it becomes.
8.6.3.13.1	And when he again puts down the Punaścitī (layer),
8.6.3.13.2	He does this in an irregular manner, when he builds the Garhapatya north of the Āhavaniya.
8.6.3.13.3	When he again puts down Punaścitti, it is this Agni which is built,
8.6.3.13.4	Having brought it back, he again puts it on the head.
8.6.3.13.5	In that he again puts the one which is already put, therefore it is called punar-chiti.
8.6.3.14.1	Some put the Garhapatya in the rear half and the punar-chitti in the front half.
8.6.3.14.2	The Ahavaniya and the Garhapatyam are these two fires.
8.6.3.14.3	These two fires are thus.
8.6.3.14.4	One should not do so.
8.6.3.14.5	This world is the Garhapatya.
8.6.3.14.6	The sky is the Ahavaniya.
8.6.3.14.7	This is the northern one of them.
8.6.3.14.8	Therefore one should place it on the northern side.
8.6.3.15.1	When one places the Garhapaty and the Punaścitī,
8.6.3.15.2	they are the altar and the northern altar of Agni.
8.6.3.15.3	And those which are placed here in front are of the sacrifice. They are of Agni.
8.6.3.15.4	Now, when he places the fire in the Upaḍhā,
8.6.3.15.5	he establishes him in the Veda and the Uttaravedas.
8.6.3.16.1	And when he again places the Citi,
8.6.3.16.2	this is the sacrifice again.
8.6.3.16.3	This is the northern sacrifice to the gods.
8.6.3.16.4	He places the sacrifice again,
8.6.3.16.5	the northern sacrifice to the Gods.
8.6.3.16.6	The sacrifice again bows to him.
8.6.3.17.1	Now, as for the reason why he lays down the Punaścitī (bricks),
8.6.3.17.2	The sages in the beginning made Agni out of the vital airs.
8.6.3.17.3	He now makes him out of that very (vital airs).
8.6.3.17.4	And because he makes him out of what is already made,
8.6.3.17.5	Therefore it is called Punaścitti.
8.6.3.18.1	By which the sages attained the sacrifice through austerity.
8.6.3.18.2	These are the sages whom he addresses.
8.6.3.18.3	"They bring Agni, the fire, to heaven."
8.6.3.18.4	"They bring the fire to heaven."
8.6.3.18.5	I have placed him in that heaven, in the sky.
8.6.3.18.6	Heaven is the sky.
8.6.3.18.7	"They call him the one with spread out sacrificial grass."
8.6.3.18.8	Those who know are the Manus.
8.6.3.18.9	"He who has spread the sacrificial grass."
8.6.3.18.10	He who has spread sacrificial grass is always so.
8.6.3.19.1	"We shall follow him with our wives, with our sons, with our brothers, or with gold."
8.6.3.19.2	"We shall all follow him."
8.6.3.19.3	"Seizing this heaven, the world of the righteous."
8.6.3.19.4	The world of the righteous is heaven.
8.6.3.19.5	Taking the world of heaven, the world of the good.
8.6.3.19.6	This is the third back, in the shining heaven.
8.6.3.19.7	This is indeed the third back, the shining one in heaven, where this shines.
8.6.3.20.1	He has ascended the middle of speech, the shining one.
8.6.3.20.2	This is truly the middle of speech where this is spread.
8.6.3.20.3	The shining one.
8.6.3.20.4-9	This is the meaning of the verse. This Agni is the good husband, the knower of truth. This Agni knows the truth of the good ones. This is the meaning of this verse. He is placed on the back of the earth, shining. He is shining, placed on the back. May they make the enemies the lower foot.
8.6.3.20.10	"May all the wicked ones be under your feet." This is what it means.
8.6.3.21.1	"This Agni is the most heroic, the one who sustains life." This is what is meant.
8.6.3.21.2	"This is the most heroic Agni, the one who maintains life." This is the meaning.
8.6.3.21.3	"Shining with a thousand rays, not declining." This is what the meaning is.
8.6.3.21.4	"Shining brightly with a thousand rays." This is the sense.
8.6.3.21.5	"Shining in the midst of the body."
8.6.3.21.6	These worlds are the body.
8.6.3.21.7	"He shines in these worlds." This is what it means.
8.6.3.21.8	"Go up to the divine abodes."
8.6.3.21.9	"Go up, to the heavenly world." This is what is meant.
8.6.3.22.1	"Move forward together, go up together."
8.6.3.22.2	This is what he says to the sages. "Move forward together to him."
8.6.3.22.3	"And go up together to him."
8.6.3.22.4	"O Agni, make the paths of the gods."
8.6.3.22.5	As the Yajus, so the connection.
8.6.3.22.6	"Making again, the young parents."
8.6.3.22.7	Speech and mind are the young parents.
8.6.3.22.8	Speech and mind, these are the two fires.
8.6.3.22.9	"The threads are following you."
8.6.3.22.10	The sage who is the thread, he says this to him:
8.6.3.23.1	"Wake up, O Agni, be alert."
8.6.3.23.2	He says this to Agni: "Wake up, be alert." Here it means: "Wake up and be alert."
8.6.3.23.3	"May you both, the desired and the undesired, be united with this one."
8.6.3.23.4	The bond is as per the Yajus.
8.6.3.23.5	This is the northernmost seat.
8.6.3.23.6	The sky is the northernmost abode.
8.6.3.23.7	The All-gods and the sacrificer sit down.
8.6.3.23.8	He thus makes the sacrificer sit with the All-gods.
8.6.3.24.1	With which you carry a thousand, with which you, O Agni, all-knowing,
8.6.3.24.2	This is his most famous abode with which he carries a thousand, with all-knowing.
8.6.3.24.3	"With that lead us to this sacrifice, to go to heaven among the gods."
8.6.3.24.4	"With that lead us here to this sacrifice, (to go) to heaven, among the gods." This is what is meant.
8.6.3.24.5	"This is your proper place."
8.6.3.24.6	Its relation has been explained.
8.6.3.24.7	He lays down eight bricks.
8.6.3.24.8	Its relation has already been explained.
8.7.1.1.1	(He lays down) the Rtuviya bricks.
8.7.1.1.2-10	The Rtuvyas are the seasons. He thus places the seasons. All this is the Rtuvyas. The Rtuvyas is the year. The year is all this. He thus puts all this. And this is generation. The Rtvya is the year. The year is generation.
8.7.1.1.11	He puts down the offspring itself.
8.7.1.2.1	Now, why he puts down the Rtavya bricks.
8.7.1.2.2	The Rtavya bricks are the Kshatriya class, the other bricks are the Vis classes.
8.7.1.2.3	He puts down the Kshatriya as the lord of the Vis.
8.7.1.2.4	He puts them down in all the layers.
8.7.1.2.5	He puts the Kshatriya down as the lord of all the Vis.
8.7.1.3.1	Now, indeed, why he puts the Rtavya
8.7.1.4.2	The seasons come together with forms.
8.7.1.4.3	They come together with forms in each season.
8.7.1.4.4	Therefore, in each season, there is the form of all seasons.
8.7.1.4.5	Those are the different beginnings.
8.7.1.4.6	They were created differently.
8.7.1.4.7	And those who have the same belly.
8.7.1.4.8	They come with forms.
8.7.1.5.1	He places it, saying:
8.7.1.5.2	"Tapas and Tapyas are the seasons of winter."
8.7.1.5.3	These are their names.
8.7.1.5.4	He places them with their names.
8.7.1.5.5	The sun is indeed Tapas.
8.7.1.5.6	Therefore these two seasons are not separated from it.
8.7.1.5.7	Because these two seasons are inseparable from it,
8.7.1.5.8	therefore they are Tapas and Tapasya.
8.7.1.6.1	You are the union within Agni.
8.7.1.6.2	This Agni is the year.
8.7.1.6.3	He is bound with the seasons.
8.7.1.6.4	He thus connects, binds together the year with the seasons. "
8.7.1.6.5	"May heaven and earth be joined, may the waters and plants be joined."
8.7.1.6.6	He thus joins together all this with the seasons.
8.7.1.6.7	May the fires be separate, for the supremacy of the eldest, with the same vows.
8.7.1.6.8	These fires are indeed separate, namely, these bricks.
8.7.1.6.9	He says this so that they may be for the supremacy of both rites.
8.7.1.6.10	Those fires who are of one mind between heaven and earth, these.
8.7.1.6.11	Just as the Yajus, so the Bandhu. The two seasons of winter and spring are being conceived. May the gods enter Indra, just as the gods entered Indra.
8.7.1.6.12	Just as the gods entered into Indra, so may these two seasons enter into the Jyesthya.
8.7.1.6.13	These are the two bricks.
8.7.1.6.14	For two months are a season.
8.7.1.6.15	He lays them down together.
8.7.1.6.16	He makes it one season.
8.7.1.7.1	What he puts here,
8.7.1.7.2	This Agni is the year.
8.7.1.7.3	These worlds are the year.
8.7.1.7.4	Its fifth layer is indeed the sky.
8.7.1.7.5	The sky is its cold season.
8.7.1.7.6	What is put here,
8.7.1.7.7	What is his own, that he puts back in him.
8.7.1.7.8	Therefore he puts them here.
8.7.1.8.1	And as to why he puts them here,
8.7.1.8.2	this Agni is Prajapati.
8.7.1.8.3	The year is Prajapati,
8.7.1.8.4	and his fifth layer is the head.
8.7.1.8.5	His head is the winter season.
8.7.1.8.6	And as he puts them here,
8.7.1.8.7	Whatever is his own, that he places in him.
8.7.1.8.8	Therefore he places these here.
8.7.1.9.1	He places them in front of the Svayambhu and the Viśvajyoti.
8.7.1.9.2	The sky is the highest Svayambhu.
8.7.1.9.3	The sun is the highest Viśvajyoti
8.7.1.9.4	He places the seasons beyond the sky and the sun.
8.7.1.9.5-10	Therefore, the seasons are only later than that. And this is indeed reproduction. He places reproduction later than heaven and the sun. Therefore, reproduction takes place only later than that Reproduction is indeed later than that. The gods who were in the beginning are the same as the gods now.
8.7.1.10.1	Then he lays down the first Svayamatr̥na and the first Visvajit above the Rtavya.
8.7.1.10.2	This is the first Svayamaitr̥na.
8.7.1.10.3	Agni is the first Visva-jit.
8.7.1.10.4	He thus places the seasons above.
8.7.1.10.5	Therefore the seasons are above this.
8.7.1.10.6	And this is the reproduction from here.
8.7.1.10.7	Above that he places the procreation.
8.7.1.10.8	Therefore, above that one is born.
8.7.1.11.1	One should not arrange them in order.
8.7.1.11.2	"So that one does not arrange the seasons in order."
8.7.1.11.3	For those who die, the seasons are arranged.
8.7.1.11.4	Therefore, wherever one places the first, one should place all there.
8.7.1.12.1	And these worlds are the seasons.
8.7.1.12.2	He builds these worlds and the higher ones with the layers.
8.7.1.12.3	And the Rituviyas are the nobility.
8.7.1.12.4	He builds the nobility with the higher layers.
8.7.1.12.5	And Rituviyas is the year.
8.7.1.12.6	He builds that year with the higher layers.
8.7.1.12.7	He should not place the bricks above them with another Yajus.
8.7.1.12.8	"So that the Kshatriya does not place the bricks over the Visha."
8.7.1.13.1	These are indeed the same.
8.7.1.13.2	The gods indeed, with the Rtuviya (bricks) came to this world from here and from there, from below and from above.
8.7.1.13.3	In the same way, the sacrificer, by means of the Rtavya verses, goes to these worlds and to those beyond and below.
8.7.1.14.1	But the Adhvaryus of the Caraka school place the Samyani bricks separately.
8.7.1.14.2	One should not do so.
8.7.1.14.3	They only push away the (Samyani) bricks.
8.7.1.14.4	These are the Samyani bricks.
8.7.1.15.1	Then he places the Visvajyotiṣa brick.
8.7.1.15.2	The sun is the highest, the all-shining.
8.7.1.15.3	For the sun is indeed the all-shining in the yonder world.
8.7.1.15.4	He thus places the sun itself.
8.7.1.16.1	And in that he places the all-shining,
8.7.1.16.2	the all-shining is indeed offspring.
8.7.1.16.3	For offspring is indeed the all shining.
8.7.1.16.4	He thus puts down the begetting.
8.7.1.17.1	He places the Viśva-jyotis (brick) in front of the Svayambhuva (bricks).
8.7.1.17.2	The heaven is the last Svayambhuvī.
8.7.1.17.3	The sun is the last Viśva-jyotī.
8.7.1.17.4	He places the sun behind the heaven.
8.7.1.17.5	Therefore this one shines only behind it.
8.7.1.17.6	And this is the generation.
8.7.1.17.7	He places generation behind the heaven.
8.7.1.17.8	Therefore, it is only from this (earth) that progeny is born.
8.7.1.18.1	Then he places the Viśva-jyotis above the first Svayamātrīṇā.
8.7.1.18.2	This (earth) indeed is the first Svayamātṛṇā.
8.7.1.18.3	Agni is the first Viśva-Jyotis.
8.7.1.18.4	From here he places Agni above.
8.7.1.18.5	Therefore, Agni shines above from here.
8.7.1.18.6	Now this is the generation.
8.7.1.18.7	From here he places the generation above.
8.7.1.18.8	Therefore, from here only is born.
8.7.1.19.1	Then on the middle one, the Self-born, above he places the Viśva-jyotis.
8.7.1.19.2	The middle one, the self-born, is the atmosphere.
8.7.1.19.3	The middle Viśva-Jyotis is the wind.
8.7.1.19.4	He places the wind in the atmosphere.
8.7.1.19.5	Therefore this is the wind in the atmosphere.
8.7.1.20.1	These are the luminaries.
8.7.1.20.2	In that he lays down these (bricks) thus, he thus establishes these luminaries in order.
8.7.1.20.3	Therefore the fire burns above this.
8.7.1.20.4	The sun shines below.
8.7.1.20.5	The wind blows here in the sky.
8.7.1.21.1	May Parameshthi settle thee.
8.7.1.21.2	For Parameshthi saw this fifth layer.
8.7.1.21.3	On the back of heaven, shining.
8.7.1.21.4	For the sun shines on the back of heaven.
8.7.1.22.1	For all breath, for out-breath, for through-breath.
8.7.1.22.2	For breath is indeed the All-Shining.
8.7.1.22.3	All this is for him.
8.7.1.22.4	"He says, "May all light be yours."
8.7.1.22.5	"This means, "May all the light be yours." "
8.7.1.22.6	"The sun is your lord."
8.7.1.22.7	He makes the sun his lord.
8.7.1.22.8	Having settled down, he recites the Sūdadohas together.
8.7.1.22.9	Its relationship has been explained.
8.7.1.23.1	These are the same as the Samyāni.
8.7.1.23.2	The gods, indeed, by means of the All-light (stones) conquered these worlds, from here and from above, from there and from below.
8.7.1.23.3	In the same way the sacrificer, by means of All-light (bricks), conquers these worlds, from this side and from above, and from there and from this side.
8.7.1.24.1	But the Adhvaryus of the Caraka (school) place the All-light bricks in a different order.
8.7.1.24.2	He should not do so.
8.7.1.24.3	They indeed expel (the oblation) by themselves.
8.7.1.24.4	These are indeed the same as the Samyāni bricks.
8.7.2.1.1	Then he lays down the Lokamprinā brick.
8.7.2.1.2	The sun indeed is the Lokamprină.
8.7.2.1.3	For he fills these worlds.
8.7.2.1.4	He thus lays down that sun.
8.7.2.1.5	He should lay it down in all the layers.
8.7.2.1.6	These layers are indeed these worlds.
8.7.2.1.7	He places that Aditya in these worlds.
8.7.2.1.8	Therefore he shines from all these worlds.
8.7.2.2.1	Now, why he places the Lokamprana bricks.
8.7.2.2.2	The Lokamprana is the nobility;
8.7.2.2.3	the other bricks are the people.
8.7.2.2.4	He places the nobility as the ruler of the people.
8.7.2.2.5	She is placed in all the layers.
8.7.2.3.7	With one Yajus he lays down many bricks.
8.7.2.3.8	He thus makes the Kshatriya class superior in strength.
8.7.2.3.9	He makes the Kshatriyas superior in strength to the Vis classes.
8.7.2.3.10	Then he lays down the others separately with different Yajuses.
8.7.2.3.11	He thus renders the Vis classes inferior in strength to the Kshatriyal class, speaking separately, with different intentions.
8.7.2.4.1	He lays down the first brick in this Sractya.
8.7.2.4.2	He places that Aditya in the eastern direction.
8.7.2.4.3	Then he goes around from there to here.
8.7.2.4.4	Then he moves around from here to there.
8.7.2.4.5	Then he comes around from there to this side.
8.7.2.4.6	Then he proceeds from there to here,
8.7.2.5.1	Whatever he places first,
8.7.2.5.2	he should place it last.
8.7.2.5.3	The sun indeed, having gone around these worlds once, does not go beyond them.
8.7.2.5.4	Having taken away the eastern ones, he places the western ones.
8.7.2.5.5	He thus causes the sun to go beyond these worlds.
8.7.2.5.6	Therefore the sun is not settled in these worlds.
8.7.2.5.7	He goes around again and again, turning to the right.
8.7.2.6.1	He says, "Satisfy the world, satisfy the void."
8.7.2.6.2	"Fill the world and fill the void." This is what it means.
8.7.2.6.3	"Then, 'May you be firm and stable.'
8.7.2.6.4	" Then, 'May you remain firm and stable.' This is what it is.
8.7.2.6.5	"Indra and Agni, and Brihaspati, have settled you in this womb."
8.7.2.6.6	"Indra, Agni, and Bri haspati have established you in this womb. This is what it says."
8.7.2.6.7	Anushtubh.
8.7.2.6.8	Speech is Anushtubh,
8.7.2.6.9	Speech is Indra,
8.7.2.6.10	Indra is Lokamprana, he does not settle down,
8.7.2.6.11	for he is settled down.
8.7.2.6.12	He speaks with Suddoha.
8.7.2.6.13	Suddoha is the breath,
8.7.2.6.14	he thus sustains him with the breath, he unites him.
8.7.2.7.1	They say, how does this Lokamprana become completed?
8.7.2.7.2	The sun is this (Lokamprana).
8.7.2.7.3	The Lokamprinā is the measure of the world.
8.7.2.7.4	And the Lokamprinā indeed is speech.
8.7.2.7.5	Speech is the measure.
8.7.2.8.1	Having placed the bricks with the Yajus formulas, he covers them with the Lokamprină.
8.7.2.8.2	The bricks with the Yājus formulas are food.
8.7.2.8.3	The Lokamprinā (brick) is the self.
8.7.2.8.4	He places food within the self.
8.7.2.8.5	Therefore, food, when placed within the self, becomes the self.
8.7.2.9.1	He places the Yajus-containing bricks in himself.
8.7.2.9.2	He places food in the wings and tail.
8.7.2.9.3	Whatever food is placed in the self, it nourishes the self and the wings and tail;
8.7.2.9.4	Whatever is placed in the wings and the tail, it does not nourish the self or the wings and tail.
8.7.2.10.1	He places the Lokamprinas and the Yajus-containing bricks in the self.
8.7.2.10.2	Therefore this self is twice as big and more abundant.
8.7.2.10.3	The Lokamprinas are in the wings and tail.
8.7.2.10.4	Therefore the wings and tail are smaller.
8.7.2.10.5	He places the bricks in the self, some lengthwise and some crosswise.
8.7.2.10.6	The bricks are bones.
8.7.2.10.7	Therefore, these bones are in the body, both lengthwise and crosswise.
8.7.2.10.8	The bones in the wings and tail are only lengthwise.
8.7.2.10.9	There are no crosswise bones in the wings or tail.
8.7.2.10.10	This is the knowledge of the cut and the uncut.
8.7.2.10.11	The cut is like this, the uncut is otherwise.
8.7.2.11.1	He covers himself with the Lokamprana of his own mothers.
8.7.2.11.2	The Prāṇa is indeed the Self-born.
8.7.2.11.3	The Āditya is the Lokampṛṇā.
8.7.2.11.4	He kindles the Prāṇa with the Āditya.
8.7.2.11.5	Therefore this Prāṇa is warm.
8.7.2.11.6	He covers the entire self with it.
8.7.2.11.7	He kindling the entire self with the Ādityas.
8.7.2.11.8	Therefore this entire self is warm.
8.7.2.11.9	This is the knowledge of one who is living and dying.
8.7.2.11.10	One who is living is warm.
8.7.2.11.11	One who will die is cold.
8.7.2.12.1	He goes on covering with ten (bricks) each time, starting from the first layer in which he places (bricks), and comes to the Svayamatrîna.
8.7.2.12.2	He goes covering with the same Dakshina-vritti, starting from the Svayamatrina, and comes to the Anûkyâ.
8.7.2.12.3	Then again, having returned, he covers that limit.
8.7.2.13.1	He covers himself first.
8.7.2.13.2	For the self is the first to be born when one is born, then the right wing, then the tail, then the left.
8.7.2.13.3	It is clockwise.
8.7.2.13.4	For that is divine.
8.7.2.13.5	And in this way the sun moves clockwise over these worlds.
8.7.2.14.1	This is indeed the breath, which is the Lokampṛṇā.
8.7.2.14.2	By that he covers the whole of himself.
8.7.2.14.3	He places the breath in the whole of himself,
8.7.2.14.4	If this part of his does not reach the navel, then that part of his does indeed not reach the navel.
8.7.2.14.5	If the breath does not reach a part of the body, it becomes dry or withers.
8.7.2.14.6	Therefore, he should cover it with all of this.
8.7.2.15.1	He puts the wings and tail on the body itself.
8.7.2.15.2	For the limbs grow on the body itself
8.7.2.15.3	If he were to put them in front and below,
8.7.2.15.4	it would be as if he were to take a limb from somewhere else and put it back.
8.7.2.16.1	He should not put them in a broken or black (place).
8.7.2.16.2	When it is broken, it is as if it is being attacked.
8.7.2.16.3	The form of distress is black.
8.7.2.16.4	"One should not make one's own self distressed."
8.7.2.16.5	"One should avoid the distress of one's own."
8.7.2.16.6	If one exceeds Viraj from the sacrificial posts,
8.7.2.16.7	one should not go beyond.
8.7.2.16.8	Now, indeed, they (the bricks) are struck by them. Having broken them, one should throw them on the heap.
8.7.2.16.9	The heap is the foundation of the excess.
8.7.2.16.10	Where there is the foundation of excess, there he establishes them.
8.7.2.17.1	Now, indeed, of the bricks of the prescribed size.
8.7.2.17.2	One should place bricks of the size of a foot in the first and last layers.
8.7.2.17.3	The foot is indeed the foundation.
8.7.2.17.4	The foot is the hand.
8.7.2.17.5	The bones of the thighs should be the largest.
8.7.2.17.6	For there is no bone smaller than the thigh bone.
8.7.2.17.7	There should be three layers of lines, each with three lines.
8.7.2.17.8	For these worlds are threefold.
8.7.2.17.9	There should two layers of lines, without limit.
8.7.2.17.10	These layers are the sap.
8.7.2.17.11	Sap is indeed unlimited.
8.7.2.17.12	All of them should be inscribed with the three lines.
8.7.2.17.13	All these worlds are indeed threefold.
8.7.2.18.1	Now, about the laying of bricks.
8.7.2.18.2	One should place in the middle layer of the altar any brick that one knows to be endowed with a mantra.
8.7.2.18.3	The middle layer of the bricks is indeed the atmosphere.
8.7.2.18.4	The atmosphere is indeed the laying of all beings.
8.7.2.18.5	Now, the bricks are indeed food.
8.7.2.18.6	The middle layer is the belly.
8.7.2.18.7	He places the food in the belly.
8.7.2.19.1	They say, "One should not place them, lest they should exceed."
8.7.2.19.2	One should indeed place them.
8.7.2.19.3	These bricks are placed for the sake of desires.
8.7.2.19.4	There is no excess of desires.
8.7.2.19.5	One should not place any.
8.7.2.19.6	The gods did only this much.
8.7.3.1.1	Then he pours down the dung.
8.7.3.1.2	Dung is flesh.
8.7.3.1.3	He covers it with flesh.
8.7.3.1.4	Having placed the bricks,
8.7.3.1.5	The bones are the bricks.
8.7.3.1.6	He covers the bones with flesh.
8.7.3.2.1	He pours it down on the self-born (bricks).
8.7.3.2.2	The self-born is the breath.
8.7.3.2.3	Dung is food.
8.7.3.2.4	He places that food in the breath.
8.7.3.2.5	He covers the whole of himself with it.
8.7.3.2.6	Therefore, since food is placed in the breath, it nourishes the whole of oneself.
8.7.3.2.7	It pervades the whole of oneself
8.7.3.3.1	Some say, "One should not sow in the self-sown."
8.7.3.3.2	The breath is the self-sowing. One should not cover the breath."
8.7.3.3.3	One should sow it.
8.7.3.3.4	The vital breaths are stabilized by food.
8.7.3.3.5	He whose food is not eaten, his vital breaths decay.
8.7.3.3.6	They do it to him in such a way that the dry grass becomes hollow.
8.7.3.3.7	Thus he is born in the other world.
8.7.3.3.8	Therefore one should sow in one's own field.
8.7.3.4.1	Having placed it on the naturally-perforated stone, he covers it with the Anūkyā stone, coming to the enclosing sticks.
8.7.3.4.2	He covers the naturally-perforate stone with the same stone, turning to the right, coming to the Anūkyâ stone again.
8.7.3.5.1	He first covers himself.
8.7.3.5.2	For the self indeed is the first to be born when one is born, then the right wing, then the tail, then the left wing.
8.7.3.5.3	That is the right-hand direction.
8.7.3.5.4	That is the divine direction.
8.7.3.6.1	This very breath is the excrement.
8.7.3.6.2	It covers the entire body.
8.7.3.6.3	It places the breath in the entire body. Now, if that part of his body does not reach the navel, then that part of his does not reach the
8.7.3.6.4	navel.
8.7.3.6.5	Whatever part of the body the breath does not reach, it dries up or withers.
8.7.3.6.6	Therefore one should cover it completely with this.
8.7.3.7.1	"He (Indra) is increased by all the worlds."
8.7.3.7.2	For all beings increase Indra.
8.7.3.7.3	"The mountain is the abode of the ocean."
8.7.3.7.4	This is his greatness.
8.7.3.7.5	"The best of charioteers among charioteers."
8.7.3.7.6	This is the best of chariots among chariots.
8.7.3.7.7	The lord of the horses, the lord of the lords.
8.7.3.7.8	Horses are food.
8.7.3.7.9	The lord, the lord of lords, of food. Thus he offers with a verse in the Indra-stotra metre.
8.7.3.7.10	Indra's is the excrement.
8.7.3.7.11	This is half of Agni, namely the excrement, the other half is the bricks.
8.7.3.8.1	They say that he lays down the bricks with all the metres and all the deities.
8.7.3.8.2	But here he pours down with each one having a single deity.
8.7.3.8.3	How is this half of Agni?
8.7.3.8.4	Indra indeed is the counter-part of all the gods.
8.7.3.8.5	When he pours down with the Indra-verse,
8.7.3.8.6	that is this half of Agnis.
8.7.3.8.7	And when with the Anushtubh,
8.7.3.8.8	Speech is the Anushtubh.
8.7.3.8.9	Speech is all the metres.
8.7.3.8.10	By that alone is the half (of the altar).
8.7.3.9.1	Then he places the Vikarni and the Svayamatrini bricks.
8.7.3.9.2	The Vikarni is Vayu.
8.7.3.9.3	The Svayamatrini is the highest heaven.
8.7.3.9.4	He places Vayu and heaven together.
8.7.3.9.5	He places them on the highest (layer).
8.7.3.9.6	For Vayu and heaven touch each other on the highest (layers).
8.7.3.9.7	For when the wind and heaven are touched,
8.7.3.9.8	he lays down the diagonal (brick).
8.7.3.9.9	He places the wind below heaven.
8.7.3.9.10	Therefore this wind blows only from below.
8.7.3.10.1	In that he lays down the diagonal
8.7.3.10.2	Where they make the horse smell the Citi, that is this Aditya, who binds these worlds together in the thread.
8.7.3.10.3	And that thread is the wind.
8.7.3.10.4	And that wind is this Vikarni.
8.7.3.10.5	And when he lays down this (Vikarni), that is this Aditya binding these worlds together in a thread.
8.7.3.11.1	Now, when he places the Vikarni and the Svayamatrna,
8.7.3.11.2	the Vikarni is indeed life,
8.7.3.11.3	and the Svayamatrnas are the vital airs,
8.7.3.11.4	he places life and the vital airs together.
8.7.3.11.5	He places them in the last (layer),
8.7.3.11.6	for life and the vital breaths touch each other in the last (stage).
8.7.3.11.7	For life and the vital breath touch each other.
8.7.3.11.8	He lays down the eastern, the northern and the diagonal (bricks).
8.7.3.11.9	He thus encloses the vital breath on both sides.
8.7.3.12.1	The horse, when it is hungry, does not eat the fodder. When it has come out of the great enclosure, the wind blows after it.
8.7.3.12.2	The dark path of your movement is shining.
8.7.3.12.3	When the wind blows in his direction, then his path becomes dark.
8.7.3.12.4	He places the Tristubh verse.
8.7.3.12.5	Because Vayu is of the Tristubh kind.
8.7.3.12.6	With the Agniya verse, because it is an Agni rite.
8.7.3.12.7	With the Anirukta verse.
8.7.3.12.8	Because the wind is Anirukta.
8.7.3.12.9	And when he says 'wind',
8.7.3.12.10	because the wind is wind.
8.7.3.13.1-9	Then he lays down the self-generated ones, saying, "I place you in the abode of life." This is indeed life, and this is its abode. "You have come down," for this indeed covers everything here. "In the shade," for everything here is in its shade. This is indeed the heart of the ocean. "Shining with rays,"
8.7.3.13.10	The heaven is indeed radiant with rays.
8.7.3.13.11	"The heaven shines, the earth, the golden (earth), the sky."
8.7.3.13.12	For thus indeed does he shine upon these worlds.
8.7.3.14.1	"May Parameshthin (the Supreme Lord) settle thee."
8.7.3.14.2	For Parameshthin indeed saw this fifth layer.
8.7.3.15.1	When indeed he places Parameshthin
8.7.3.15.2	Prajapati, having been scattered, the deities took him and went away.
8.7.3.15.3	Parameshthi took his head and having gone up, stood.
8.7.3.16.1	He said to him, "Come near me."
8.7.3.16.2	"Give this to me by which you went away from me."
8.7.3.16.3	"What will happen to me then?"
8.7.3.16.4	"This will be yours, dedicated to your deity, and will be mine."
8.7.3.16.5	"So be it."
8.7.3.16.6	That Parameshthi (the Supreme Lord) placed here.
8.7.3.17.1	That which is the highest, the self-born one.
8.7.3.17.2	This is his own self. When he places this here,
8.7.3.17.3	it is that which belongs to his self. He places it back in this.
8.7.3.17.4	Therefore he places this here.
8.7.3.18.1	On the back of heaven, shining, spreading.
8.7.3.18.2	This is the back of heaven, stretched out, extended.
8.7.3.18.3	Do thou protect heaven.
8.7.3.18.4	Do thou strengthen heaven.
8.7.3.18.5	Do not injure heaven.
8.7.3.18.6	This means: 'Do thou protect thyself, do thou strengthen thyself, do not injure thyself.'
8.7.3.19.1	For all breathing in, breathing out, breathing through, and breathing up.
8.7.3.19.2	The self-controlled breath is indeed the breath.
8.7.3.19.3	The breath is for all of him.
8.7.3.19.4	For the establishment and for the conduct.
8.7.3.19.5	These worlds are self-soothed.
8.7.3.19.6	These worlds, the establishment and the conduct.
8.7.3.19.7	May the sun protect you.
8.7.3.19.8	This means: May the sun protect you well.
8.7.3.19.9	With the great one, may there be welfare.
8.7.3.19.10	This means with the great one, there may be welfare.
8.7.3.19.11	With the gentle one, may there by peace.
8.7.3.19.12	Whatever is the most soothing of that, that is this.
8.7.3.20.1	He places them in different places.
8.7.3.20.2	For the wind and the sky are different.
8.7.3.20.3	He places it down once.
8.7.3.20.4	He makes it uniform.
8.7.3.20.5	For life and breath are uniform.
8.7.3.20.6	They are both pebbles, both self-spread.
8.7.3.20.7	For life is uniform with breath.
8.7.3.21.8	The Visas are the sacrifice.
8.7.3.21.9	For the Visas are the sacrifices.
8.7.3.21.10	For in the sacrifice all beings are established.
8.7.3.21.11	In the three shining heavens.
8.7.3.21.12	The three pressing-times are the shining ones. He says this about the pressing-times.
8.7.3.21.13	In the Anushtubh metre.
8.7.3.21.14	Speech is the Anushtubb.
8.7.3.21.15	Speech is all the breaths.
8.7.3.21.16	He thus unites and joins them with speech and with the breath.
8.7.3.21.17	She, the one true Sūdadohā, moves through all the bricks.
8.7.3.21.18	Sūdadohā is indeed the breath.
8.7.3.21.19	Therefore, this one breath, being present, moves through all parts of the body and the entire self.
8.7.4.1.1	Then he sings the Sāman verses in the Svayamātrīṇās.
8.7.4.1.2	These worlds are the Svayamā-trīṇās,
8.7.4.1.3	and these are the sand-grains.
8.7.4.1.4	Those gods, having placed them, saw them as they are now, namely, dry sand.
8.7.4.2.1	They said, "Let us know how we can put juice and sustenance in these worlds."
8.7.4.2.2	They said, “Let us reflect.”
8.7.4.2.3	They said, indeed, “Let us think.”
8.7.4.2.4	"Let us give nourishment in these worlds."
8.7.4.3.1	They, reflecting, saw these common (syllables).
8.7.4.3.2	They sang them.
8.7.4.3.3	They gave nourishment in these worlds.
8.7.4.3.4	In the same way the Sacrificer, when he sings these common (scriptures), gives nourishment in these worlds.
8.7.4.5.6	In these very worlds he places the nourishment, the food.
8.7.4.6.1	They have different beginnings and a common end.
8.7.4.6.2	Because they have different beginnings,
8.7.4.6.3	they are seen as different.
8.7.4.6.4	And because they have a common end,
8.7.4.6.5	for the sacrifice has only one foundation, only one end, namely heaven alone.
8.7.4.6.6	Therefore the ends are heaven and light.
8.7.4.7.1	Then he sprinkles him with pieces of gold.
8.7.4.7.2	Herein all this Agni is duly prepared.
8.7.4.7.3	In it the gods placed this immortal, supreme form.
8.7.4.7.4	So also does he place this immortal, supreme, form in it.
8.7.4.8.1	In that he sprinkles him with gold pieces,
8.7.4.8.2	This is the beautiful body which he places in front of him, in the middle, of gold and man.
8.7.4.8.3	Then he covers him completely with this beautiful body above.
8.7.4.9.1	With two hundred (bricks).
8.7.4.9.2	The Sacrificer has two feet.
8.7.4.9.3	The Sacrificer is Agni.
8.7.4.9.4	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, so much of the supreme form of immortality he places in him.
8.7.4.9.5	Five times.
8.7.4.9.6	Agni has five layers.
8.7.4.9.7	The year has five seasons.
8.7.4.9.8	Agni is the year.
8.7.4.11.4	You are a thousand.
8.7.4.11.5	For the thousand you are.
8.7.4.11.6	The whole is a thousand.
8.7.4.11.7	You are the whole.
8.7.4.11.8	For the whole you are. This is it.
8.7.4.12.1	Now, indeed, the examination of the layers and the dust.
8.7.4.12.2	This very world is the first layer.
8.7.4.12.3	The animals are the dust.
8.7.4.12.4	When he covers the first layer with soil, he covers this world with cattle.
8.7.4.13.1	The second layer is indeed the atmosphere.
8.7.4.13.2	The soil is the birds.
8.7.4.13.3	When he covers the second layer with soil, then he covers the atmosphere with birds.
8.7.4.14.1	The third layer is indeed the sky.
8.7.4.14.2	The soil are the stars.
8.7.4.14.3	When he covers the third layer with clay, he covers the heaven with the stars.
8.7.4.15.1	The fourth layer is the sacrifice.
8.7.4.15.2	The clay is the Dakshina.
8.7.4.15.3	When he covers the fourth layer with clay, then he covers the sacrifice with the Dakshina
8.7.4.16.1	The fifth layer is the sacrificer.
8.7.4.16.2	The clay are the offspring.
8.7.4.16.3	When he covers the fifth layer with clay, he covers the sacrificer with offspring.
8.7.4.17.1	The sixth layer is indeed the heavenly world.
8.7.4.17.2	The gods are the clay.
8.7.4.17.3	When he covers the sixth layer with clay, then he covers the heavenly world with the gods.
8.7.4.18.1	The seventh layer is indeed immortality.
8.7.4.18.2	He places it as the highest.
8.7.4.18.3	That is the immortal, the supreme of all this.
8.7.4.18.4	Therefore, the immortal is the supreme of all.
8.7.4.18.5	Therefore, gods are not hidden.
8.7.4.18.6	Therefore, they are called immortal. Thus, it is about the deity.
8.7.4.19.1	Now, about the inner self:
8.7.4.19.2	This very support and this downward-moving breath are the first layer of the body, flesh and excrement.
8.7.4.19.3	When he covers the first layer with clay, he covers this body with flesh.
8.7.4.19.4	(The bricks) are placed.
8.7.4.19.5	The bones are the bricks.
8.7.4.19.6	He covers the bones with flesh.
8.7.4.19.7	He does not cover them from below.
8.7.4.19.8	Therefore these vital airs are not covered from below.
8.7.4.19.9	But he covers it from above. This is his flesh that covers him from above.
8.7.4.19.10	Therefore this flesh of his, which is covered from above, does not show.
8.7.4.20.1	What is above the foundation and below the middle is
8.7.4.20.2	The second layer is flesh and excrement.
8.7.4.20.3	When he covers the second layer with dung, he covers it with flesh.
8.7.4.20.4	He places the bricks.
8.7.4.20.5	The bone-bricks.
8.7.4.20.6	He covers the bone with flesh.
8.7.4.20.7	Dung he places.
8.7.4.20.8	He covers it with dung. He covers it with flesh on both sides.
8.7.4.20.9	Therefore this is his body, covered with flesh on both sides, and there is no space (for anything else).
8.7.4.21.1	The middle itself is the third layer.
8.7.4.21.2	What is above the middle and below the neck is the fourth layer.
8.7.4.21.3	The neck itself is the fifth layer.
8.7.4.21.4	The head itself is the sixth layer.
8.7.4.21.5	The vital airs themselves are the seventh layer.
8.7.4.21.6	He places that uppermost layer.
8.7.4.21.7	He places the vital airs of this entire (universe) in the highest (place).
8.7.4.21.8	Therefore the vital airs of all this are the highest. He places the excrement.
8.7.4.21.9	Excrement is flesh.
8.7.4.21.10	He establishes the vital airs in flesh.
8.7.4.21.11	He does not cover it above.
8.7.4.21.12	Therefore these vital airs are uncovered above.
9.1.1.1.1	Now he offers the hundred Rudras.
9.1.1.1.2	Here all this Agni is sanctified.
9.1.1.1.3	Here he is the deity Rudra.
9.1.1.1.4	In him the gods placed this supreme form of immortality.
9.1.1.1.5	Here he stood shining, desiring food.
9.1.1.1.6	Therefore the gods were afraid, thinking, "What if he should harm us?"
9.1.1.2.1	They said, "Let us bring food to him."
9.1.1.2.2	"Let us appease him with that."
9.1.1.2.3	They brought that food to him, which was dedicated to the peaceful deity, and with that they appeased him.
9.1.1.2.4	Because they appeased that deity with that, therefore it is dedicated to the peaceful (deity).
9.1.1.2.5	That which is dedicated to the peace deity, they call it the hundred-rudimentary-deities. It is indirect.
9.1.1.2.6	The gods are desirous of the unseen.
9.1.1.2.7	In the same way, he places this excellent form of immortality in him.
9.1.1.2.8	He stands shining here, desiring food.
9.1.1.2.9	Therefore, he collects this food for him, dedicated to the peaceful gods.
9.1.1.2.10	With that, he pacifies him.
9.1.1.3.1	He offers with sesame seeds.
9.1.1.3.2	This is generated when it is collected.
9.1.1.3.3	It is produced from all kinds of food.
9.1.1.3.4	Both kinds of food are used here, namely, the food of the Jartila and the food of the village and the forest.
9.1.1.3.5	The food of the village is the sesame seeds.
9.1.1.3.6	The food in the forest is the food that grows in uncultivated land.
9.1.1.3.7	He thus pleases him with both kinds of food, namely, the village food and the forest food.
9.1.1.4.1	He offers with a leaf of the Arka plant.
9.1.1.4.2	Food is the sun.
9.1.1.4.3	He thus propitiates him with food.
9.1.1.5.1	He offers on the parishedas.
9.1.1.5.2	The parishedas are the fires.
9.1.1.5.3	Thus his offerings to the fires are not made in excess.
9.1.1.6.1	In that he offers this oblation to the hundred Rudras,
9.1.1.6.2	The gods departed from Prajapati's body.
9.1.1.6.3	The one god alone did not abandon anger.
9.1.1.6.4	He stood stretched out within it.
9.1.1.6.5	He wept.
9.1.1.6.6	The tears that flowed from him stood in that anger.
9.1.1.6.7	He became the one with a hundred heads, Rudra, with a thousand eyes and a hundred shields.
9.1.1.6.8	Then the other drops that fell, they entered this world, innumerable thousands.
9.1.1.6.9	And because of the crying, the Rudras were called Rudras.
9.1.1.6.10	This Rudra, with a hundred heads, a thousand eyes, a hundred thighs, with a bow in his hand, with arrows fixed, terrifying, stood, desiring food.
9.1.1.6.11	From him the gods were afraid.
9.1.1.7.1	They said to Prajapati,
9.1.1.7.2	"We are afraid of him. If he does not harm us."
9.1.1.7.3	He said, "Gather food for him.
9.1.1.7.4	He will be appeased by that."
9.1.1.7.5	They gathered this food for him, consisting of a hundred Rudras.
9.1.1.7.6	By that he was appeased.
9.1.1.7.7	Now, because he pacified that Rudra with a hundred heads, therefore it is called the pacifier of Rudra with a Hundred Heads.
9.1.1.7.8	They call it the pacifier of the hundred Rudras. The gods are fond of indirect speech.
9.1.1.7.9	In the same way, this one gathers food for him, the hundred Rudras,
9.1.1.7.10	with which he pacifies him.
9.1.1.8.1	He offers with cakes of Gavedhuka.
9.1.1.8.2	When that deity was lying down, the Gavedhuka plants grew up from it.
9.1.1.8.3	He propitiates him with his own share and his own juice.
9.1.1.9.1	He offers with Arka leaves.
9.1.1.9.2	Arka grew up from the lying down of this deity.
9.1.1.9.3	He propitrates him with his own part and his own juice
9.1.1.10.1	He offers on the Parisrita (fire).
9.1.1.10.2	The hair is the fringe.
9.1.1.10.3	For the hair, no poison or anything else can do any harm.
9.1.1.10.4	Standing to the north of the fire, he offers towards the north. For this is the direction of this deity.
9.1.1.10.5	He thus propitiates him in his own direction.
9.1.1.10.6	He offers in his own direction
9.1.1.11.1	He first makes the offering at the knee-height.
9.1.1.11.2	The height of the knee is indeed the lower world.
9.1.1.11.3	The lower world is indeed this world.
9.1.1.11.4	He pleases those Rudras who entered this world.
9.1.1.12.1	Then (the height) of the navel.
9.1.1.12.2	The height of the navel is indeed the middle.
9.1.1.12.3	The middle world is indeed the world of the atmosphere.
9.1.1.12.4	Those Rudras who entered the sky-world, he pleases them.
9.1.1.13.1	Then for the mouth-covering.
9.1.1.13.2	The mouth-covering is indeed above.
9.1.1.13.3	This world is indeed above. 
9.1.1.13.4	Those Rudras who entered this world, he pleases them with the Svāhā-form.
9.1.1.13.5	Svāhā-form is indeed food.
9.1.1.13.6	He thus propitiates them with food.
9.1.1.14.1	"He says, "Salutations to thee, O Rudra, the angry one."
9.1.1.14.2	He makes salutations to that anger which was spread out in him.
9.1.1.14.3	"He also says, "Salut to thy bow and salut to thy arms."
9.1.1.14.4	He stood threatening with his bow and arms.
9.1.1.15.1	This is the god who is the Kshatra, who became the one with a hundred heads.
9.1.1.15.2	The other Vis classes are those who came from the Vipru.
9.1.1.15.3	For this Kshatra, these Vis classes brought forth this first Uddhara, which is the first Anuvaka.
9.1.1.15.4	With that, they pleased him.
9.1.1.15.5	In the same way, this one brings forth this first Udhara in front of him and pleases him with it.
9.1.1.15.6	Therefore this is a sacrifice to one deity, to Rudra.
9.1.1.15.7	For he pleases him with this.
9.1.1.16.1	There are fourteen formulas in this.
9.1.1.16.2	There is a year with thirteen months.
9.1.1.16.3	Prajapati is the fourteenth.
9.1.1.16.4	Prajapater is Agni.
9.1.1.16.5	He pleases him with as much food as Agni is and as much as his measure is.
9.1.1.16.6	Obeisance, obeisance.
9.1.1.16.7	Sacrifice is obeisance.
9.1.1.16.8	He thus salutes him with sacrifice and obeisance.
9.1.1.16.9	Therefore one should not say what is not sacrificial.
9.1.1.16.10	One should say as one would say, 'Sacrifice is he.'
9.1.1.17.1	Then he offers to the pairs, saying, 'Obeisance to this and to that.'
9.1.1.17.2	It is as if one were to say, "You and he should not harm me." This is what he says.
9.1.1.17.3	For one who is invited, it is more difficult to harm.
9.1.1.18.1	Salutations to the golden-armed commander, the lord of the directions.
9.1.1.18.2	He alone is the golden-armed general, the lord of directions.
9.1.1.18.3	Whatever is here dedicated to one deity, thereby he pleases him. He makes the Kṣatriya a sharer in the Viśa.
9.1.1.18.4	Therefore, whatever belongs to the Viśas, the Kṣatriyas are sharers in that.
9.1.1.18.5	Then those countless thousands who entered these worlds, those are the deities to whom he offers this.
9.1.1.19.1	Then he offers to the born ones.
9.1.1.19.2	These were born, and the Rudras entered them.
9.1.1.19.3	Wherever they are, he pleases them with that.
9.1.1.19.4	And thus indeed these are the births of the Rudras.
9.1.1.19.5	The men follow the ways of the gods.
9.1.1.19.6	Therefore these are the births among men.
9.1.1.19.7	He pleases them according to their birth.
9.1.1.20.1	Those who bow to both, those who bow to one, and those who bow to neither.
9.1.1.20.2	Those who bow to both are more terrible and more restless than those who bow to either.
9.1.1.20.3	He appeases them by means of both the sacrifice and the bowing.
9.1.1.21.1	He offers oblations at the end of the first Anuvaka and at the end of each Anuvaka.
9.1.1.21.2	The oblations are for the food.
9.1.1.21.3	He thus propitiates them with food.
9.1.1.22.1	Then he recites these mantras: "Salutations to you, O Kirikas!"
9.1.1.22.2	This is the most beloved abode of the gods, like a dear son or the heart.
9.1.1.22.3	Therefore, one should offer oblations with these Vyāhṛtis at a place where one fears this god.
9.1.1.22.4	One indeed attains the beloved abode of this god.
9.1.1.22.5	Thus this god does not harm one.
9.1.1.23.1	"Salutations to you, O Kirīkebhys!"
9.1.1.23.2	These alone do all this.
9.1.1.23.3	"These are the hearts of the gods."
9.1.1.23.4	Agni, Vayu, and Aditya - these are the hearts of those gods.
9.1.1.23.5	"Salutations to those who search."
9.1.1.23.6	These alone search everything.
9.1.1.23.7	"Salutatioṇs to those who scatter."
9.1.1.23.8	These scatter him whom they wish to scatter.
9.1.1.24.7	And these are his names and forms.
9.1.1.24.8	He thus pleases him with the names.
9.1.1.24.9	"He says, 'Do not injure, do not injure these creatures, these cattle; do not injure us in any way.'
9.1.1.24.10	The binding is as the text.
9.1.1.25.1	This is the god of the Kshatriya.
9.1.1.25.2	Therefore, for this king, these people lifted up that first section from the front.
9.1.1.25.3	Then they lifted up this one for him from above and pleased him with it.
9.1.1.25.4	In the same way, he lifts up this one for this one from above and pleases him with it.
9.1.1.25.5	Therefore, this is dedicated to one deity, namely Rudra.
9.1.1.25.6	For he pleases him with this.
9.1.1.26.1	There are seven formulas in this.
9.1.1.26.2	Agni has seven layers.
9.1.1.26.3	The year has seven seasons.
9.1.1.26.4	The year is Agni.
9.1.1.26.5	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with that much food he pleases him.
9.1.1.26.6	They become twenty-one in all.
9.1.1.26.7	Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun, are twenty-one. He attains this abundance.
9.1.1.27.1	Then he offers the Avatanas.
9.1.1.27.2	The gods, having pleased them with this food, then made them take up the bows with these Avatanas.
9.1.1.27.3	In the same way, having pleased them with this food, he then covers their bows with these coverings.
9.1.1.27.4	For one cannot strike anyone with a bow that is not covered.
9.1.1.28.1	It is said to be a thousand yojanas.
9.1.1.28.2	This is the greatest distance, namely a thousand yojanos.
9.1.1.28.3	Whatever is the most distant, that he makes these bows to reach.
9.1.1.29.1	Or whatever is a thousand yojanas.
9.1.1.29.2	This Agni is a thousand yojnas.
9.1.1.29.3	For there is nothing beyond this.
9.1.1.29.4	Whatever he offers in the fire, that he makes them to reach with their bows a thousand yojanas.
9.1.1.30.1	The great ocean is said to have countless thousands.
9.1.1.30.2	Wherever they are, he puts down these bows.
9.1.1.31.1	He offers ten such offerings.
9.1.1.31.2	The Viraj has ten syllables.
9.1.1.31.3	Viraj is Agni.
9.1.1.31.4	There are ten directions.
9.1.1.31.5	Agni is the directions.
9.1.1.31.6	There are the ten vital airs.
9.1.1.31.7	The vital airs are Agni.
9.1.1.31.8	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, by so much he makes these bows.
9.1.1.32.1	Then he offers the descending oblations.
9.1.1.32.2	This indeed is the way he ascends these worlds from here upwards.
9.1.1.32.3	He ascends it as if going away.
9.1.1.32.4	This indeed, is the foundation.
9.1.1.32.5	The gods went to this foundation.
9.1.1.32.6	In the same way the sacrificer now approaches this firm foundation.
9.1.1.33.1	And why he descends again,
9.1.1.33.2	he now approaches them, thus pleased.
9.1.1.33.3	He thus rescues himself from there, for life.
9.1.1.33.4	Thus he attains the whole of his life with this self.
9.1.1.34.1	And why indeed he descends again,
9.1.1.34.2	He thus propitiates those Rudras who are above.
9.1.1.34.3	And again from yonder world.
9.1.1.35.1	"Let there be salutations to the Rudras who are in heaven."
9.1.1.35.2	He thus pays salutations to those Rudras who exist in yonder world.
9.1.1.35.3	Those whose arrows are the rain.
9.1.1.35.4	Their arrows are indeed the rain.
9.1.1.35.5	Those who injure him for a year.
9.1.1.35.6	Those who are about to injure him.
9.1.1.36.1	Salutations to the Rudras who are in the sky.
9.1.1.36.2	He pays homage to those Rudras who are here in the world of the sky.
9.1.1.36.3	Whose arrows are the wind.
9.1.1.36.4	The wind is their arrow.
9.1.1.36.5	They injure him with the wind, those who are about to harm him.
9.1.1.37.1	Obeisance to the Rudras who are on the earth.
9.1.1.37.2	He thus pays obeisance to those Rudras who are in this world.
9.1.1.37.3	Whose food is arrows.
9.1.1.37.4	Food is their arrows.
9.1.1.37.5	They injure with food him whom they intend to injure.
9.1.1.38.1	From them ten eastwards, ten southwards, ten westwards, ten northwards, ten upwards.
9.1.1.38.2	The Viraj has ten syllables.
9.1.1.38.3	Viraj is Agni.
9.1.1.38.4	There are ten directions.
9.1.1.38.5	The directions are Agni.
9.1.1.38.6	There ate ten vital airs.
9.1.1.38.7	The vital airs are Agni.
9.1.1.38.8	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, by so much he pleases them with this food.
9.1.1.39.1	He says, "Ten, ten."
9.1.1.39.2	There are ten fingers in the hand.
9.1.1.39.3	He makes the gesture of salutation in each direction.
9.1.1.39.4	Therefore, one makes the gesture of salutations out of fear.
9.1.1.39.5	"May there be salutations to them."
9.1.1.39.6	He makes salutations to them.
9.1.1.39.7	"May they be kind to us."
9.1.1.39.8	They indeed are kind to him.
9.1.1.39.9	"Those whom we hate, and those who hate us, we place in their jaws."
9.1.1.39.10	He places in their jaws those whom he hates, and those who hates him.
9.1.1.39.11	"I place in their jaws this one," he should say, if he hates someone.
9.1.1.39.12	Then there is no more of him in that.
9.1.1.39.13	One should not even care about that.
9.1.1.39.14	For he himself has been designated as the one who hates him who knows thus.
9.1.1.40.1	One descends three times.
9.1.1.40.2	Agni is threefold.
9.1.1.40.3	He pleases them with as much food as Agni has and as much as his measure is.
9.1.1.40.4	With the word "svāhā".
9.1.1.40.5	Svāhā is food.
9.1.1.40.6	He pleases him with food.
9.1.1.40.7	Three times, he ascends upwards.
9.1.1.40.8	That is six.
9.1.1.40.9	Its relation has been explained.
9.1.1.41.1	When one descends three times,
9.1.1.41.2	one ascends upwards three times.
9.1.1.41.3	One descends as many times as one ascends.
9.1.1.42.1	Then he throws that Arka leaf into the Catvāla.
9.1.1.42.2	This is the fierce rite that he performs.
9.1.1.42.3	This is not peaceful.
9.1.1.42.4	He performs this rite to conceal it, lest anyone should approach this which is not peaceful. Lest he should be destroyed.
9.1.1.42.5	Therefore in the Catvāla.
9.1.1.42.6	What is in the Catvāļa?
9.1.1.42.7	This Catvāla is Agni.
9.1.1.42.8	Thus indeed this Agni burns him.
9.1.1.42.9	Now indeed the prosperity itself.
9.1.1.43.1	They say, how does he attain the year with this hundred-rudimentary (fire)?
9.1.1.43.2	How does he attain prosperity with the year and Agni?
9.1.1.43.3	Sixty and three hundred is this hundred-rudirimentary.
9.1.1.43.4	Then thirty.
9.1.1.43.5	Now, thirty-five.
9.1.1.43.6	Then, sixty-three hundred days are the days of a year.
9.1.1.43.7	He obtains the days of a solar year.
9.1.1.43.8	Then, thirty-thirty nights are the nights of a month.
9.1.1.43.9	He obtains nights of a month
9.1.1.43.10	He obtains the day and night of a solar year.
9.1.1.43.11	Now the thirty-five (days) and the thirteenth month, that is the Self.
9.1.1.43.12	The Self is thirty.
9.1.1.43.13	Two are the foundations.
9.1.1.43.14	Two are breaths.
9.1.1.43.15	The head is the thirty-fifth.
9.1.1.43.16	This is the full year.
9.1.1.43.17	Thus indeed, he attains the year with a hundred Rudras.
9.1.1.43.18	Thus he attains the year by means of the year.
9.1.1.43.19	In the Sandilā fire, these (bricks) are placed in the middle, having mantras.
9.1.1.43.20	These bricks are indeed separate fires.
9.1.1.43.21	Thus his fires are separately offered with the Satrūriya.
9.1.1.44.1	They say, how does he attain this great Satrūriya hymn?
9.1.1.44.2	How does one attain the great praise?
9.1.1.44.3	Those twenty-five verses and the eighty-five, that is the twenty-five-fold Self.
9.1.1.44.4	Where there is the Self, that is the head, those are the wings and tail.
9.1.1.44.5	And those eighty-five, they are the attainment of the eighty-five.
9.1.1.44.6	For the great praise is called by eighty-five.
9.1.1.44.7	Now that which is above eighty, that is the Great Upavasatha.
9.1.1.44.8	This is his, and thus he attains this Great Upavasathaiya of a hundred Rudras.
9.1.1.44.9	Thus he attains the Great Upavasta.
9.1.2.1.1	Then he anoints him from here.
9.1.2.1.2	The gods, having pacified him with the Śatarudriya, then further pacified him with this.
9.1.2.1.3	In the same way, having pacified it with the Śatarudra, he further pacifies it with this.
9.1.2.2.1	He sprinkles with water.
9.1.2.2.2	Water is peace.
9.1.2.2.3	He pacifies it.
9.1.2.2.4	He sprinkles it all around.
9.1.2.2.5	He thus appeases him from all sides.
9.1.2.2.6	He sprinkles him three times.
9.1.2.2.7	Agni is threefold.
9.1.2.2.8	He thus appeases him to the extent that Agni is and to the extent of his measure.
9.1.2.3.1	And why he sprinkles him,
9.1.2.3.2	These indeed are the worlds, this is Agni.
9.1.2.3.3	He thus encloses these worlds with water.
9.1.2.4.4	On the stone.
9.1.2.4.5	For from the stone the waters flow.
9.1.2.4.6	From the hollow.
9.1.2.4.7	For from a hollow the waters flow. 
9.1.2.4.8	From the right hollow.
9.1.2.4.9	For the waters flow from the right hollow. 
9.1.2.5.1	"The waters that flow on the stone, that are settled on the mountain,"
9.1.2.5.2	For the waters are settled on the stone, on the mountains.
9.1.2.5.3	From the waters, from the plants, from the trees, the milk is collected.
9.1.2.5.4	For from all this it is collected.
9.1.2.5.5	The Maruts, the protectors, give us that food and strength.
9.1.2.5.6	The Marutas indeed rule over the rain.
9.1.2.5.7	He places it on the stone, saying, "Thy hunger is on the stone."
9.1.2.5.8	He places hunger on the stone.
9.1.2.5.9	Therefore, the stone is the first.
9.1.2.5.10	Or, the stone is firm, and hunger is firm.
9.1.2.5.11	He places firmness on the firm.
9.1.2.5.12	He takes it with the verse, "May strength be in me."
9.1.2.5.13	He places strength in himself.
9.1.2.5.14	Similarly, the second.
9.1.2.5.15	Similarly, third.
9.1.2.6.1	Having placed it, he burns it three times, turning it over.
9.1.2.6.2	This is as if it were making him lighter by going around him on all sides.
9.1.2.6.3	Therefore, he makes it lighter for him for the sake of non-injury.
9.1.2.7.1	And why does he turn it upside down?
9.1.2.7.2	This is as if it is following him.
9.1.2.7.3	From that very (place) he rescues himself for the sake of life.
9.1.2.7.4	Thus, with this self, one attains the whole of life.
9.1.2.8.1	He turns it three times.
9.1.2.8.2	For he goes around it three times. He turns it three
9.1.2.8.3	times, as many times as he goes around it.
9.1.2.9.1	Then they carry that stone, having placed it in the cart, in this direction.
9.1.2.9.2	This is the southern direction.
9.1.2.9.3	He places the impurity in the southern direction.
9.1.2.10.1	Having thus appeased him with the hundred-rudimentary-verses and water, the gods then removed his impurity and sin with this (verse).
9.1.2.10.2	In the same way he now appeases him with the hundred rudimentary verses and water, and then removes his impurity and sin.
9.1.2.11.1	He carries the fire outside.
9.1.2.11.2	These worlds are this fire.
9.1.2.11.3	He places the impurity outside these worlds, outside the altar.
9.1.2.11.4	This is the altar.
9.1.2.11.5	He places the impurity outside it.
9.1.2.12.1	Standing to the east of the southern shoulder of the altar, he casts the impurity towards the south, saying, "May the curse reach him whom we hate."
9.1.2.12.2	The curse reaches him whom he hates.
9.1.2.12.3	"May this curse reach him whom you hate."
9.1.2.12.4	Then there is no more of him.
9.1.2.12.5	One should not even heed that.
9.1.2.12.6	For he himself has indicated the one whom he hates.
9.1.2.12.7	If it does not break, one should say, "Break!"
9.1.2.12.8	When it breaks, then the curse reaches the one whom he hated.
9.1.2.12.9	They come without waiting.
9.1.2.12.10	They cast off the evil of impurity without waiting.
9.1.2.13.1	Having returned, they make the bricks the cows.
9.1.2.13.2	The gods, having pacified him with the hundred-rudra rite and with water, having removed his evil of impurity, and having returned, made the bricks the cows.
9.1.2.13.3	Having thus appeased him with the hundred-rudimentary-elemental-water and having removed his impurity and sin, he returns and makes the bricks in the form of cows.
9.1.2.14.1	Some say that one should make it while sitting.
9.1.2.14.2	One should milk a cow while sitting.
9.1.2.14.3	But one should make it standing.
9.1.2.14.4	These worlds are this Agni.
9.1.2.14.5	The worlds seem to stand still.
9.1.2.14.6	And standing, indeed, one is more vigorous.
9.1.2.15.1	Standing towards the north and east,
9.1.2.15.2	The cow stands towards the west, facing the sacrificer.
9.1.2.15.3	They approach the cow standing towards the south, facing the west.
9.1.2.16.1	When he touches her, he mutters this formula:
9.1.2.16.2	"These bricks of mine, O Agni, may be cows."
9.1.2.16.3	Agni is indeed the one who makes them cows.
9.1.2.16.4	Therefore, he invokes Agni of these many deities.
9.1.2.16.5	One and ten, the end and the other half.
9.1.2.16.6	This is indeed the half of the earth, namely, one and ten.
9.1.2.16.7	Then this is the other half, namely, the end and other half.
9.1.2.16.8	And the gods, having taken them from the lower and upper half, made them cows.
9.1.2.16.9	And in the same way this one, having taken them both from the lower and the upper half, makes them cows.
9.1.2.16.10	Therefore one should not neglect to make many.
9.1.2.16.11	Here he makes them many by means of the Brahman and the Yajus.
9.1.2.16.12	Now when he makes it continuous, he makes the desires continuous.
9.1.2.17.1	Whatever the bricks do, they do for the cow.
9.1.2.17.2	This Agni is speech.
9.1.2.17.3	For it is by speech that he is conceived.
9.1.2.17.4	When he says, "One and ten, the end and the half," speech is one, speech is ten, speech is the end, speech is the half.
9.1.2.17.5	The gods made speech the cow.
9.1.2.17.6	In the same way, the sacrificer makes speech itself the cow.
9.1.2.17.7	And when he extends it, he extends speech itself.
9.1.2.17.8	"These bricks of mine, O Agni, may be cows in the other world, in the yonder world."
9.1.2.17.9	He makes them cows in this world.
9.1.2.17.10	And he makes them cows in the yonder world.
9.1.2.18.8	"He who is the best of the ghee-drippers and the honey-drippers."
9.1.2.18.9	He makes him the best of the Ghee-drippers and Honey-drippers.
9.1.2.19.1	"The name of Viraj."
9.1.2.19.2	Indeed, the gods call these bricks by their names.
9.1.2.19.3	As they call them by their names, they approach them.
9.1.2.19.4	Then the Lokampranas remained far away, with the names of Ahi and Ni-memi-hatya.
9.1.2.19.5-11	They called them Virajas. They approached them. Therefore, having placed ten bricks, one recites the Lokamprana mantra. That makes them Virajas. For the Viraj has ten syllables. They are the wish-yielding cows, not diminishing. That makes the cows wish-yielding and not diminishing.
9.1.2.20.1	Then he pulls him out with a frog, a piece of wood, or a branch of the Vetasa tree.
9.1.2.20.2	The gods, having pacified him with the hundred-rudimentary-form and water, having removed his sin and impurity, then pacified him further.
9.1.2.20.3	Having thus appeased him with the hundred-rudimentary-formulas and with water, he appeases his sin, and then he appeases him still further.
9.1.2.20.4	He draws him in all directions.
9.1.2.20.5	He appeases him in all directions thus.
9.1.2.21.1	And why he draws him in.
9.1.2.21.2	This is where the sages of the vital airs first united Agni, and they sprinkled him with water.
9.1.2.21.3	Those waters overflowed.
9.1.2.21.4	They became frogs.
9.1.2.22.1	They said to Prajapati, "What has become of what was ours?"
9.1.2.22.2	He said, "This is the tree of him."
9.1.2.22.3	"Let us know."
9.1.2.22.4-9	to know. They call him Vetasa, but only indirectly. The gods desire to know indirectly. And when they said, "Where did he go?" they became the Avakkas. They call them Avakkas, but only indirectly.
9.1.2.22.10	These are the three waters: the frog, the Avaka plant, and the Vetasa branch.
9.1.2.22.11	He appeases him with these three waters.
9.1.2.23.1	When he draws him out,
9.1.2.23.2	he is born, for when he is piled up, he is born.
9.1.2.23.3	He is born for all food.
9.1.2.23.4	All food is the frog, the avaka plant, and vetasa branch.
9.1.2.25.2	"With the waters of the ocean, we pacify thee." This is what it means.
9.1.2.26.1	Then with the lower half (of the body), "We pacify thee with the embryo of Himas, O Agni, with the shining one, may he be auspicious to us."
9.1.2.26.2	What is cold and very cold of Himas, that is its embryo.
9.1.2.26.3	"With the cold and very cold, we pacify you." This is what is meant.
9.1.2.27.1	Then with the second half (of the verse) he goes forward to the east, to the ground, to the grass. Go down, O Agni, to the rivers.
9.1.2.27.2	You are the bile of the waters.
9.1.2.27.3	O frog, come with them.
9.1.2.27.4	Make this our sacrifice, which is of the colour of fire, peaceful."
9.1.2.27.5	The binding is as the Yajus.
9.1.2.28.1	Then with the first half (of the same verse) he goes southwards, to the place of descent,
9.1.2.28.2	to the abode of the ocean.
9.1.2.28.3	May the other enemies of ours be burnt.
9.1.2.28.4	May the fire be auspicious to us.
9.1.2.28.5	As is the Yajus, so is the Bandhu.
9.1.2.28.6	First he draws (the line) towards the east, then he says 'atha' (thus), 'atha' (so), 'atha'.
9.1.2.28.7	That is the right-hand turn.
9.1.2.28.8	For that is the divine way.
9.1.2.29.1	He first draws himself (towards the east).
9.1.2.29.2	For the self indeed comes first among those who are born.
9.1.2.30.6	"May the fire, shining on our right side, protect us."
9.1.2.30.7	"The tail of the fire, which is made by the one who is being burnt, is the tail."
9.1.2.30.8	"The fire on the northern side is the fire."
9.1.2.30.9	What is auspicious and peaceful is the fire.
9.1.2.30.10	He pacifies it indeed.
9.1.2.31.1	He draws it with seven (strokes).
9.1.2.31.2	The fire has seven layers.
9.1.2.31.3	The year has seven seasons.
9.1.2.31.4	The year is Agni.
9.1.2.31.5	He draws him out to the extent that Agni is and to the extent of his measure.
9.1.2.31.6	Having placed that bamboo on the heap,
9.1.2.32.1	he then sings around it with the Sāman verses.
9.1.2.32.2	Here this entire Agni is prepared.
9.1.2.32.3	In that the gods placed this immortal supreme form.
9.1.2.32.4	and in the same way he places this excellent form of immortality in it.
9.1.2.32.5	The Sama-s are performed.
9.1.2.32.6	The Sama hymns are the vital airs.
9.1.2.32.7	The vital airs are indeed immortality.
9.1.2.32.8	He places this excellent form, which is immortality, in it.
9.1.2.32.9	He sings all around.
9.1.2.32.10	He places the excellent form of immortality all around in it.
9.1.2.33.1	When he sings around him with the Sāman verses,
9.1.2.33.2	the gods desired, "Let us make this body of ours immortal and without bones."
9.1.2.33.3	They said, "Let us know how to make this body of us immortal and without bones?"
9.1.2.33.4	They said, 'Let us meditate.'
9.1.2.33.5	They said, indeed, 'Let us desire the meditation.'
9.1.2.33.6	Therefore, let us desire to make this self immortal and without bones."
9.1.2.34.1	While reflecting, they saw these commonalities.
9.1.2.34.2	They surrounded him.
9.1.2.34.3	They made this self immortal and free from bones.
9.1.2.34.4-9	In the same way the sacrificer makes his self immortal and without bones by singing him with the Sāman. He makes it immortal and without bones on all sides. He sings it on all sides. Thus he makes his self immortal without bones on all the sides. He stands and sings. The worlds are indeed standing. And standing one is more vigorous.
9.1.2.34.10	He sings with the sound "hiṅ".
9.1.2.34.11	Therein the entire Sama is present.
9.1.2.35.1	He sings the Gāyatrī in front.
9.1.2.35.2	Agni is Gāyatrī.
9.1.2.35.3	He makes Agni the head of it.
9.1.2.35.4	And he makes its head immortal without bones.
9.1.2.36.1	The Rathantara on the right wing.
9.1.2.36.2	This (earth) is the Rathantara.
9.1.2.36.3	This is indeed the most tasty of these worlds.
9.1.2.36.4	For in this all tastes are present.
9.1.2.36.5	The Rathantara is indeed the most delicious, they say, indirectly.
9.1.2.36.6	For the gods desire indirectly.
9.1.2.36.7	This makes the right wing of this (earth).
9.1.2.36.8	And this makes the right wing immortal and without bones.
9.1.2.37.1	The Brihat is the northern wing.
9.1.2.37.2	The sky is the Brihat.
9.1.2.37.3	The sky indeed is the most extensive.
9.1.2.37.4	He makes this its northern wing.
9.1.2.37.5	And he makes this its northern, boneless, immortal wing.
9.1.2.38.1	The Vamadevya in the self.
9.1.2.38.2	The Vāmadevya is indeed the breath.
9.1.2.38.3	The wind is the breath.
9.1.2.38.4	The wind is the self of all the gods.
9.1.2.38.5	He makes this his own self.
9.1.2.38.6	And he makes his own self immortal and without bones.
9.1.2.39.1	The Yajnyayajniya is the tail.
9.1.2.39.2	The Yajnnyayajniy is the moon.
9.1.2.39.3	For whatever sacrifice is performed, the essence of its offerings goes to him.
9.1.2.39.4	That which this Yajñopajjna (the Yajñopavita) goes to, that is the Moon. The Yajñopavitam (the Yajnopavita) is the Moon.
9.1.2.39.5	He makes this his tail.
9.1.2.39.6	He makes his tail boneless and immortal.
9.1.2.40.1	Then he sings the heart of Prajapati.
9.1.2.40.2	The sun is the heart.
9.1.2.40.3	This is smooth.
9.1.2.40.4	The heart is smooth.
9.1.2.40.5	This is round.
9.1.2.40.6	The heart is round.
9.1.2.40.7	One sings to oneself.
9.1.2.40.8	The heart belongs to oneself.
9.1.2.40.9	In the armpit.
9.1.2.40.10	The heart indeed is in the armpit. 
9.1.2.40.11	In the right armpit.
9.1.2.40.12	For from here the heart does not go.
9.1.2.40.13	He makes this his heart like the sun.
9.1.2.40.14	Then indeed he makes his heart immortal and without bones.
9.1.2.41.1	He sings in the offspring and in Prajapati.
9.1.2.41.2	When he sings in the offspring, he places the heart in the offspring.
9.1.2.41.3	When he sing in Prajapati, he places the heat in the fire.
9.1.2.42.1	When he indeed sings in the offspring as well as in Prajapati,
9.1.2.43.6	These are the bricks.
9.1.2.43.7	If one were to sing other than the Adhvaryu, it would be a variegated (song).
9.2.1.1.1	On the Upavasatha day, when the sun has risen in the morning, he releases speech.
9.2.1.1.2	Having released speech, he takes up five spoonfuls of clarified butter.
9.2.1.1.3	There he places five pieces of gold.
9.2.1.1.4	Then this triad is poured together: curd, honey and ghee, in a vessel, a pan or a pot.
9.2.1.1.5	He places a handful of darbha grass above it.
9.2.1.2.1	Then he ascends the fire, saying, "Salutations to your radiance, O Agni.
9.2.1.2.2	Salutations to your lustre."
9.2.1.2.3	Here is all this Agni.
9.2.1.2.4	This Agni is sanctified here.
9.2.1.2.5	Therefore, it is enough to do what is harmful to him whom one wishes to harm.
9.2.1.2.6	He who harms him with his radiance or with his light, he harms him.
9.2.1.2.7	Thus he does not harm him with these.
9.2.1.2.8	May other calamities burn us.
9.2.1.2.9	May the fire be auspicious to us.
9.2.1.2.10	As is the Yajus, so is the Bandhu.
9.2.1.3.1	Having ascended the fire, he pours clarified butter five times drawn out for the Svayamatrins.
9.2.1.3.2	Its relationship is stated.
9.2.1.4.1	He pours clarified butter for the Svayamātrins.
9.2.1.4.2	The Svayamātrī is the breath.
9.2.1.4.3	He places food in the breath.
9.2.1.5.1	In that he pours clarified butter for Svayamātrīs,
9.2.1.5.2	This is the northern altar of Agni.
9.2.1.5.3	And that which he spreads out first, that is the altar of the sacrifice.
9.2.1.5.4	He spreads it out for him.
9.2.1.6.1	He spreads out the gold there, seeing it.
9.2.1.6.2	What one sees is indeed manifest.
9.2.1.6.3	The northern altar is manifest.
9.2.1.6.4	They come here.
9.2.1.6.5	What comes is indeed hidden.
9.2.1.6.6	The Uttaravedi is indirect.
9.2.1.7.1	He sprinkles it with the Svāhā-form.
9.2.1.7.2	The Svāhā- form is direct.
9.2.1.7.3	The Uttaravedi is direct.
9.2.1.7.4	With the Vet-form this one.
9.2.1.7.5	The Vet-form is indirect.
9.2.1.7.6	The Uttaravedi is indirect.
9.2.1.7.7	With ghee.
9.2.1.7.8	They sprinkle the Uttaravedi with ghee.
9.2.1.7.9	with five handfuls.
9.2.1.7.10	For they strew the northern altar with five handfuls of earth.
9.2.1.7.11	With a mixture.
9.2.1.7.12	For they mix the northern altar with a mixture of earth.
9.2.1.8.1	"The man-seat is the altar."
9.2.1.8.2	The man-seat (nṛṣad) is the breath.
9.2.1.8.3	Men are men.
9.2.1.8.4	This is the fire that is the breath among men, and he pleases it.
9.2.1.8.5-12	The Apsusade is Veda. He thus pleases the Agni who is in the waters. The Bahisade is Veda. The Agni who is in plants, he thus pleases. The Vanasade is Veda. He thus pleases the Agni which is in the trees. The Svarvide is Veda. This Agni is Svarvide.
9.2.1.8.13	He thus propitiates this very Agni.
9.2.1.9.1	When he says, 'To the man-seated, to the water-seated',
9.2.1.9.2	these are the names of this Agni.
9.2.1.9.3	He thus propitiates them.
9.2.1.9.4	He makes the deity with the oblation.
9.2.1.9.5	The deity to whom the oblation is offered, that deity is pleased, not the one to whom it is not offered.
9.2.1.9.6	Now, indeed, he places these fires in this fire by name.
9.2.1.10.1	He offers five oblations.
9.2.1.10.2	The Agni has five layers.
9.2.1.10.3	The year has five seasons.
9.2.1.10.4	The year is Agni.
9.2.1.10.5	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with so much he thus satisfies him with food.
9.2.1.11.1	Then he anoints it with curds, honey and ghee.
9.2.1.11.2	This is what is produced when it is piled up.
9.2.1.11.3	It is produced from all food.
9.2.1.11.4	All food is curds, honey, ghee.
9.2.1.11.5	He thus pleases it with all food.
9.2.1.11.6	He anoints it from all sides.
9.2.1.11.7	He thus satisfies it with all food from all sides.
9.2.1.12.1	Whatever he offers to him,
9.2.1.12.2	Here this entire Agni is consecrated.
9.2.1.12.3	In that the gods placed this supreme form,
9.2.1.12.4	So in this he places this supreme form.
9.2.1.12.5	Food is the form.
9.2.1.12.6	This is the supreme food, namely curd, honey, and ghee.
9.2.1.12.7	Whatever is the supreme form, that he places in this (pātra) as the supreme.
9.2.1.12.8	He is surrounded on all sides by the external (pātra).
9.2.1.12.9	He places in this (Agni) the supreme form on all sides.
9.2.1.12.10	With darbha-blades.
9.2.1.12.11	They are pure and sacred.
9.2.1.12.12	With the tips.
9.2.1.12.13	The tips are the supreme of the gods.
9.2.1.13.1	Whatever he surrounds
9.2.1.13.2	This is the place where the sages, in the beginning, united Agni with the vital airs. Then they made him the eastern part of the sky, the part of the sun.
9.2.1.13.3	Then they made him the upper part of the sky when he was piled up.
9.2.1.13.4	The gods, the gods of the gods, the sacrificers, the sacrificers.
9.2.1.13.5	With curds, honey and ghee.
9.2.1.13.6	Its relation has been explained.
9.2.1.14.1	The gods, the gods, of the gods, of those who are to be sacrificed to, of those who sacrifice.
9.2.1.14.2	These gods are the gods of the sacrificers, of those who offer sacrifices.
9.2.1.14.3	They sit down near the Samvatsarīṇam (cup).
9.2.1.14.4	For they sit down near the share of the Samvatsarīn.
9.2.1.14.5	"At this sacrifice, the breathers have not offered the oblation."
9.2.1.14.6	For the breathers have indeed not offered the oblations.
9.2.1.14.7	"May they themselves drink of the honey and ghee."
9.2.1.14.8	This means, 'May they themselves drink the honey and ghee.'
9.2.1.15.1	Those gods who have gone to the gods, to the divine state.
9.2.1.15.2	For these gods have gone to the divine state among the gods.
9.2.1.15.3	Those who are the leaders of Brahma, here.
9.2.1.15.4	This Agni is Brahma, and these are his leaders.
9.2.1.15.5	From whom not one wind blows, not any abode.
9.2.1.15.6	For not one wind blows from the vital airs, not any abode.
9.2.1.15.7	They are not in heaven, nor on earth, nor in the womb.
9.2.1.15.8	They are not in heaven or on earth, but in that which contains breath, that is what it means.
9.2.1.16.1	He releases it with two (verses).
9.2.1.16.2	The sacrificer has two feet.
9.2.1.16.3	The sacrificer is Agni.
9.2.1.16.4	As great as Agni is, as great is his measure, with so much he releases him.
9.2.1.17.1	Then he descends, saying, "The breath-giver, the out-breath-giver."
9.2.1.17.2	All these are the breaths, this Agni which is kindled.
9.2.1.17.3	If he does not say this, "This is my share," then indeed this (Agni) would destroy his breaths here.
9.2.1.17.4	But when he says this, "This (Agni) is my share," thus indeed this (Agna) does not destroy his breaths.
9.2.1.17.5	The Prāṇada, Apānaḍa, Vyānaḍa, Varcoḍa, Varivoḍa.
9.2.1.17.6	He says this: "Give me this."
9.2.1.17.7	May other afflictions torment us.
9.2.1.17.8	May the fire be auspicious to us.
9.2.1.17.9	The binding is as per the Yajus.
9.2.1.18.1	Having returned, he performs the Prāvargya and Upasads.
9.2.1.18.2	After the Pravargya and Upavargya rites, he gives him the vow or the half-vow.
9.2.1.18.3	Then after the Pravargya rite and the Upavargya rite,
9.2.1.18.4	Then after the Upavargva rite, he releases it, having obtained the desire for which he performs it.
9.2.1.19.1	One should release it after pouring around (water).
9.2.1.19.2	It becomes heated and shining.
9.2.1.19.3	If he were to throw it on land, then the curse would reach him.
9.2.1.19.4	If he were to throw in water, then the curse could reach him.
9.2.1.19.5	But when he throws it in the flowing water, then neither the water nor the land is harmed.
9.2.1.19.6	Because he does not throw it in the water, therefore the water is not harmed.
9.2.1.19.7	And because the water flows around it on all sides,
9.2.1.19.8	Water is peace.
9.2.1.19.9	Therefore, he does not injure these.
9.2.1.19.10	Therefore, one should remove the ashes from the fire.
9.2.1.20.1	One should remove them in the fire itself.
9.2.1.20.2	This fire is indeed these worlds.
9.2.1.20.3	The water is the surrounding.
9.2.1.20.4	When one removes the ashes from the Agni, one removes them from the surrounding.
9.2.1.21.1	What one removes from the Agni,
9.2.1.21.2	This Agni is indeed these worlds.
9.2.1.21.3	Agni, Vayu, and Aditya, these are the Pravargya rites.
9.2.1.21.4	If one were to offer them outside the fire, one would place these gods outside these worlds.
9.2.1.21.5	But when one offers them in the fire, one places these gods in these worlds.
9.2.1.22.1	When one offers them in fire,
9.2.1.22.2	The Pravargya is the head of this sacrifice.
9.2.1.22.3	This Agni is the Self.
9.2.1.22.4	If one were to place it outside the Agni, one would place the head outside of oneself.
9.2.1.22.5	But when one places it in the Agni, one places the head back on the Self after having purified it.
9.2.1.23.1	He places the first Pravargya on the naturally grown grass.
9.2.1.23.2	The Prāṇa is the self-born mother.
9.2.1.23.3	The head is the Pravargya.
9.2.1.23.4	This is the head and the Self, the Agni that is being piled up.
9.2.1.23.5	The head and the Self are sustained and bound together by the Prāṇa.
9.2.1.23.6	Having thrown away the Pravargya, as it is to be thrown away,
9.2.2.1.1	Having returned to the Agni, about to strike, he offers oblations and places the kindling woods.
9.2.2.1.2	The gods, when he was about to come, satisfied him with food and oblations and kindling-sticks.
9.2.2.1.3	In the same way he now satisfies him with food and kindling-wood and oblations.
9.2.2.1.4	He takes five handfuls.
9.2.2.1.5	The significance of this is explained.
9.2.2.2.1	Then he takes up sixteen spoonfuls.
9.2.2.2.2	Prajapati is sixteenfold.
9.2.2.2.3	Prajapti is Agni.
9.2.2.2.4	He thus pleases him with food equal to his own self.
9.2.2.2.5	Whatever food is equal to one's own self, one sustains it and does not injure it.
9.2.2.2.6	What is more than that, one injures it.
9.2.2.2.7	What less than that, one does not sustain it.
9.2.2.2.8	He takes it in the common ladle.
9.2.2.2.9	For Agni is common to all.
9.2.2.2.10	He offers with the Vaisvānara verses.
9.2.2.2.11	Agni is all-work.
9.2.2.2.12	He thus pleases him.
9.2.2.2.13	He offers three oblations.
9.2.2.2.14	Agni has three layers.
9.2.2.3.7	This is the only living thing among the trees that is not dead, namely, the moist one.
9.2.2.3.8	He thus pleases it with that which is the only living and not dead thing among the trees.
9.2.2.3.9	They are poured into ghee.
9.2.2.3.10	Ghee is Agni's.
9.2.2.3.11	He thus satisfies him with his own share, with his own juice.
9.2.2.3.12	They stay there the whole night.
9.2.2.3.13	There they are united with the juice.
9.2.2.3.14	He offers three kindling-sticks.
9.2.2.3.15	Agni is threefold.
9.2.2.3.16	He thus pleases him with as much food as Agni is and as much as his measure is.
9.2.2.4.1	In that he offers these oblations,
9.2.2.4.2	the gods, when he was about to come, pleased him with these oblations.
9.2.2.4.3	and in the same way he prepares him for his coming with food from the front with these oblations.
9.2.2.5.1	He takes five spoonfuls.
9.2.2.5.2	This head-wind is divided into five parts: mind, speech, breath, sight, and hearing.
9.2.2.5.3	He places this fivefold head-wind in him.
9.2.2.5.4	Agni with his sharp radiance. With the sharp one.
9.2.2.5.5	He burns his head with this (verse) for sharpness.
9.2.2.6.1	Then he takes up sixteen (measures) of Soma.
9.2.2.6.2	Eight are the vital airs, eight are the limbs. This is the union.
9.2.2.6.3	He takes it in the ladle which is common.
9.2.2.6.4	For the limbs and the breaths are in the same Self.
9.2.2.6.5	He offers separately.
9.2.2.6.6	He makes a support for the limbs and the vital airs.
9.2.2.6.7	He offers with the verses addressed to Viśvakarman.
9.2.2.6.8	This Agni is Viśvakarmin.
9.2.2.6.9	He thus makes him pure.
9.2.2.6.10	He offers three oblations.
9.2.2.6.11	Agni is threefold.
9.2.2.6.12	Whatever is the extent of Agni, whatever is his measure, by that much he nourishes him with food.
9.2.2.6.13	With seventeen verses.
9.2.2.6.14	Prajapati is seventeenfold.
9.2.2.6.15	Agni is Prajapati.
9.2.2.6.16	Whatever is the extent of the Agni, whatever is its measure, by that he nourishes him.
9.2.2.6.17	With twenty-onefold taking.
9.2.2.6.18	The twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and this sun are the twenty-one.
9.2.2.6.19	This is the attainment.
9.2.2.7.1	Now, when he lays down these kindling-sticks,
9.2.2.7.2	the gods, having made him whole and complete, then satisfied him with this food, with these kindling- sticks.
9.2.2.7.3	And in the same way he now makes him complete all this, and then satisfies him with this food and these kindling woods.
9.2.2.7.4	They are of Udumbara wood, moist.
9.2.2.7.5	They lie down in ghee all night.
9.2.2.7.6	Its relation is stated.
9.2.2.7.7	O Indra, lead him to the northern direction.
9.2.2.7.8	"Lead this one to the other world, for whom we offer oblations in the house."
9.2.2.7.9	As is the Yajus, so is the connection.
9.2.2.7.10	One places three kindling sticks.
9.2.2.7.11	Agni is threefold.
9.2.2.7.12	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, by so much he pleases him with food.
9.2.2.7.13	One offers three oblations.
9.2.2.7.14	That makes six.
9.2.2.7.15	Its connection has been explained.
9.2.3.1.1	Now, then, he orders (the Hotṛ) to recite the Udyat-hymns.
9.2.3.1.2	"Take up the Upayamāṇī-verses."
9.2.3.1.3	"Recite to Agni being taken away."
9.2.3.1.4	"O Agni-d, go with the single-pointed stick."
9.2.3.1.5	"O Brahman, recite the Apatiratha (hymn)."
9.2.3.3.3	"May this be the second for me."
9.2.3.3.4	"They said, 'So be it,' and made Bṛhaspati the second for him."
9.2.3.3.5	Bṛhaspati is indeed Brahman.
9.2.3.3.6	Then Indra and Bṛhaspati, having defeated the Asuras, Rakṣas, and enemies on the right side, performed this sacrifice in a place free from danger.
9.2.3.4.1	This is what the gods did.
9.2.3.4.2	These are the demons and Rākṣasas that were destroyed by the gods.
9.2.3.4.3	When he does this, he says, 'I do what the gods did.'
9.2.3.4.4	And Indra and Brhaspati destroyed the demons and Rakshas on the right side, and made the sacrifice free from fear and free from demons.
9.2.3.5.1	He who is Indra, he is Apratiraṭha.
9.2.3.5.2	He who is Brihaspati, he is Brahmā.
9.2.3.5.3	When Brahmā recites Apratiraṭa, he thereby drives away the Asuras, the Rakṣas, and the fiends from the south with Indra and Brihaspati, and performs this sacrifice free from fear and free from fiends.
9.2.3.5.4	Therefore Brahmā recitess Apratiraṭā.
9.2.3.6.1	The swift one, the fierce one, the bull, the terrible one.
9.2.3.6.2	The twelve verses of Indra are of equal form.
9.2.3.6.3	Twelve months are a year.
9.2.3.6.4	The year is Agni.
9.2.3.6.5	As great as Agni is, as great as his measure is, with that much he repels the Asuras, the Rakshas, the enemies, on the right side.
9.2.3.6.6	With Tristubh verses.
9.2.3.6.7	The Tristubh is the thunderbolt.
9.2.3.6.8	By means of the thunderbolt he thus repels the Asuras, the Rakshas, the evil spirits, on the right side.
9.2.3.6.9	They amount to twenty-two Gāyatrī verses.
9.2.3.6.10	They are Agni's.
9.2.3.6.11	For Agni is the deity.
9.2.3.7.1	Then he lifts it up with the verse, "May all the gods, O Agni, lift thee up with their thoughts."
9.2.3.7.2	His relation has been told.
9.2.3.8.1	Now they proceed to the five directions, saying, "May the divine goddesses protect the sacrifice."
9.2.3.8.2	The gods and the Asuras, both of whom were Prajapati's sons, contended for the directions.
9.2.3.8.3	The gods won the directions from the Asuras.
9.2.3.8.4	In the same way the sacrificer wins the directions from his hateful enemy.
9.2.3.8.5	"Divine" (they say),
9.2.3.8.6	The Goddesses make it for them.
9.2.3.8.7	"The Goddesses protect this sacrifice."
9.2.3.8.8	"This means, "The Goddesses protect the sacrifice."
9.2.3.8.9	"They are driving away the evil-minded one who is evil-minded."
9.2.3.8.10	Evil-mindedness is hunger.
9.2.3.8.11	"This means "They are driving away hunger."
9.2.3.8.12	"They approach the lord of sacrifice for prosperity."
9.2.3.9.5	"He is to be praised."
9.2.3.9.6	This means "fit for sacrifice."
9.2.3.9.7	"He is grasped."
9.2.3.9.8	This means "he is held."
9.2.3.9.9	"Having taken the hot (water), they sacrificed."
9.2.3.9.10	They sacrificed having taken the hot (Soma).
9.2.3.9.11	"The gods sacrificed the sacrifice with energy."
9.2.3.9.12	The gods sacrificed the Soma with energy.
9.2.3.10.1	For the divine upholder, for the one who supports.
9.2.3.10.2	For this is the divine upholder and supporter.
9.2.3.10.3	For the divine glory, for the one with glory, for the hundred offerings.
9.2.3.10.4	For this indeed is the divine glory, the one with glory and the hundred offerings.  
9.2.3.10.5	The gods took up the sacrifice and came.
9.2.3.10.6	For the gods indeed took up this sacrifice and came.
9.2.3.10.7	The gods, acting as Adhvaryus, stood for the gods.
9.2.3.10.8	The sacrifice is indeed an Adhvara.
9.2.3.10.9	The gods, acting as sacrificers, stood for the (other) gods. This is what it means.
9.2.3.11.1	The oblation has been offered, the peace has been offered, and the peace has been pacified.
9.2.3.11.2	This means: 'The offering has been made, the offering has been well made.'
9.2.3.11.3	The sacrifice is the fourth where the oblation goes.
9.2.3.11.4	The Adhvaryu murmurs the Yajus formulas in front.
9.2.3.11.5	The Hotṛ recites the Rk verses from the rear.
9.2.3.11.6	The Brahman recites the Apratiratha from the right side.
9.2.3.11.7	This is indeed the fourth sacrifice.
9.2.3.11.8	Then may the blessings of the Vākas be accepted by us."
9.2.3.11.9	Then may the Vākas and blessings be accepted by us. This is what it means.
9.2.3.12.1	The sun's rays, Harikeśa, Savitr, the light, rising constantly from the east.
9.2.3.12.2	This is the sun, this is Agni.
9.2.3.12.3	This is the sun-ray, Harikeśa, the shining one, going forth in front of Savitr, this light rises constantly.
9.2.3.12.4	Pusha goes forth in his impulse, knowing.
9.2.3.12.5	Pusha is cattle.
9.2.3.12.6	They move forth in his impulse.
9.2.3.12.7	Looking on all the worlds, the protector.
9.2.3.12.8	This one looks on all this.
9.2.3.12.9	This is the protector of this entire world.
9.2.3.13.1	Those five directions which are below the sun, the gods won from the Asuras.
9.2.3.13.2	And they ascended them.
9.2.3.13.3	The sacrificer wins his enemies by them.
9.2.3.13.4	And he ascends them.
9.2.3.13.5	Now, indeed, by means of these (bricks) the gods attained to the Atman.
9.2.3.13.6	In the same way he now attains to the Atman by means of these.
9.2.3.14.1	Then he lays down the spotted stone.
9.2.3.14.2	The spotted stone is yonder sun.
9.2.3.14.3	He thus lays down yonder sun.
9.2.3.14.4	It becomes spotted.
9.2.3.14.5	For the circle is spotted by the rays.
9.2.3.14.6	He places it between the Ahavaniya and the Garhapatya.
9.2.3.14.7	This world is the Garhapaty.
9.2.3.14.8	The heaven is the Ahavaniya.
9.2.3.14.9	He places it between these two worlds.
9.2.3.14.10	Therefore this one shines between these two worlds here.
9.2.3.15.1	At the time of the Agnidhra.
9.2.3.15.2	The Agnidhra is the atmosphere.
9.2.3.15.3	He places that in the atmosphere.
9.2.3.15.4	Therefore, he is the abode of the atmosphere.
9.2.3.15.5	Vyadha.
9.2.3.15.6	Vyadhas, indeed, are here from this.
9.2.3.16.1	That is this Prāṇa.
9.2.3.16.2	He places Prāṇa in himself.
9.2.3.16.3	That is indeed this life.
9.2.3.16.4	He places life in himself.
9.2.3.16.5	This is indeed food.
9.2.3.16.6	This is life.
9.2.3.16.7	Food is indeed life.
9.2.3.16.8	It becomes a stone.
9.2.3.16.9	Or it is firm like a stone.
9.2.3.16.10	It makes the life firm.
9.2.3.16.11	It becomes speckled.
9.2.3.16.12	For food is speckled.
9.2.3.17.1	He places it with the verse, "This is the firm one in the middle of heaven."
9.2.3.17.2	For this is the firm one indeed in the middle of the heaven.
9.2.3.17.3	"The one who fills the two worlds, the sky,"
9.2.3.17.4	For this rising one fills these worlds.
9.2.3.17.5	He describes the Visvacis as the Ghritacis.
9.2.3.17.6	This is the ladle and the altar.
9.2.3.17.7	Between the former and the latter banner.
9.2.3.17.8	This means between this world and the other world.
9.2.3.17.9	And also that which is now being piled up and that which was piled up earlier.
9.2.3.18.1	The bull, the ocean, the red, the Suparna.
9.2.3.18.2	For this is the red-hued Uksa, the ocean, the Suparna.
9.2.3.18.3	"He entered the womb of his father, the eastern one."
9.2.3.18.4	For he enters the womb of his eastern father.
9.2.3.18.5	"He is placed in the middle of heaven, the speckled stone."
9.2.3.18.6	For he is placed in the midst of heaven, the mottled stone.
9.2.3.18.7	"He has spread over the ends of the world."
9.2.3.18.8	He who is advancing, he reaches the ends of these worlds.
9.2.3.19.1	He places it with two (bricks).
9.2.3.19.2	The Sacrificer has two feet.
9.2.3.19.3	The Sacrificer is Agni.
9.2.3.19.4	He places him with as much as Agni is and as much as is his measure.
9.2.3.19.5	With three Tristubh verses.
9.2.3.19.6	For this (Agni) is connected with the Tristubh.
9.2.3.19.7	He does not press down.
9.2.3.19.8	He is not non-existent.
9.2.3.19.9	He does not recite the Sūdadoha.
9.2.3.19.10	Prāṇa is Sūdadoha,
9.2.3.19.11	he is Prāṇa.
9.2.3.19.12	"How can I place Prāṇa in Prāṇa?"
9.2.3.19.13	Placing it so that it does not perish.
9.2.3.20.1	Then they approach Indra, all increasing.
9.2.3.20.2	His relationship has been explained.
9.2.3.20.3	"The divine call, the sacrifice, and the coming."
9.2.3.20.4	"May the god Agni, the inviter, invite the gods."
9.2.3.20.5	The god Agni is both the inviter and the invited.
9.2.3.20.6	"May Agni, the god, invite the gods and bring them."
9.2.3.20.7	This means, "May Agni, the God, invite the gods, and may he bring them."
9.2.3.21.1	"May I be grasped by the uplifting of the strength."
9.2.3.21.2	"May Indra, with his grasping power, cast down my enemies."
9.2.3.21.3	As the Yajus, so the meaning.
9.2.3.22.1	Brahma and the gods have increased both the grasping and the releasing.
9.2.3.22.2	"May Indra and Agni, with their grasping power, cast away my enemies."
9.2.3.22.3	"As the Yajur, so the meaning."
9.2.3.23.1	Those four directions which are above that sun, the gods won them from the Asuras.
9.2.3.23.2	And they ascended them.
9.2.3.23.3	The sacrificer wins his enemies by them.
9.2.3.23.4	And he ascends them.
9.2.3.23.5	And by them the gods won this (world).
9.2.3.23.6	In the same way, he obtains this by means of the Abhijas.
9.2.3.24.1	Then they ascend the fire.
9.2.3.24.2	"They ascend, saying, "Do you ascend the heaven with Agni."
9.2.3.24.3	The heaven is the world of heaven.
9.2.3.24.4	"They say, "Do you go up with this Agni to this heaven."
9.2.3.24.5	"Bearing the pot in their hands."
9.2.3.24.6	They indeed bear the pot in their hand.
9.2.3.24.7	Having gone to the highest heaven, he dwells with the gods.
9.2.3.24.8	Having gone to the highest heavenly world, he dwells with gods. This is the meaning.
9.2.3.25.1	Go to the eastern direction, knowing.
9.2.3.25.2	The eastern direction belongs to Agni.
9.2.3.25.3	Go to your own direction, knowing. This is the sense.
9.2.3.25.4	"May Agni be in front of Agni."
9.2.3.25.5	"This is said: 'May Agni be in the front of Agni.'
9.2.3.25.6	'May I shine in all directions.'
9.2.3.25.7	'May he shine in all directions' is what is meant.
9.2.3.25.8	'Grant us sustenance for the two-legged and the four-legged.'
9.2.3.25.9	He seeks a blessing.
9.2.3.26.1	I ascend from the earth to the sky.
9.2.3.26.2	From the sky to heaven.
9.2.3.26.3	They go from the Garhapatya to the Agnidhra.
9.2.3.26.4	From the Agnidhra to the Ahavaniya.
9.2.3.26.5	From the heaven, from the surface of the sky, I have come to the heavenly light.
9.2.3.26.6	From the surface of the heaven, I have come from the heavenly world. This is what it means.
9.2.3.27.1	Those who go to heaven do not look back, they ascend to the heaven and earth.
9.2.3.27.2	Those who go to the heavenly world do not look back.
9.2.3.27.3	Those who know the sacrifice which is supported on all sides, the wise one who spreads it.
9.2.3.27.4	This very sacrifice is supported on all four sides.
9.2.3.27.5	Those who spread it are indeed the wise ones.
9.2.3.28.1	O Agni, go forth, the first of those who worship the gods.
9.2.3.28.2	This Agni is yours. Go forth, the first of those who worship the gods.
9.2.3.28.3	The eye of the gods and of men.
9.2.3.28.4	This is the eye of both, of the gods and men.
9.2.3.28.5	Seeking, in accord with the Bhrigus.
9.2.3.28.6	This means: Seeking, in accord with those who worship.
9.2.3.28.7	May the sacrificers go to heaven, may they be well.
9.2.3.28.8	"May the sacrificers go, to heaven, may be well." This is what it means.
9.2.3.29.1	Those are the five directions in the other world which the gods won from the Asuras.
9.2.3.29.2	And they ascended them.
9.2.3.29.3	The sacrificer also wins his enemies by them.
9.2.3.29.4	Then indeed he mounts them.
9.2.3.29.5	And indeed, by means of these, the gods attained to this (world).
9.2.3.29.6	And in the same way, he attains to this (world) by means of these.
9.2.3.30.1	Then he offers to him.
9.2.3.30.2	The gods, having approached him, satisfied him with food from above with this offering.
9.2.3.30.3	and in the same way he now nourishes him with food from above, with this offering.
9.2.3.30.4	To Krishna (the dark one) and Shuklavatsa (the white calf) with milk.
9.2.3.30.5	Night is Krishna, Shuklavatsa.
9.2.3.30.6	Her calf is the sun.
9.2.3.30.7	He nourishes him with his own share, with his own juice.
9.2.3.30.8	When it is held above.
9.2.3.30.9	For he pleases him with this above.
9.2.3.30.10	With the milking.
9.2.3.30.11	For milk is given with the milking.
9.2.3.31.1	When he offers it,
9.2.3.31.2	This is the head of the sacrifice, namely Agni.
9.2.3.31.3	The breath is milk.
9.2.3.31.4	He places the breath in the head.
9.2.3.31.5	One should offer it as one would pour out from a self-flowing vessel.
9.2.3.31.6	Prāṇa is the self-born.
9.2.3.31.7	This is the essence.
9.2.3.31.8	The head and that Prāṇa are nourished and united with the essence.
9.2.3.31.9	"Naktôṣāsā samanasa virūpe" (RV 10.125.1).
9.2.3.31.10	Its relation has been stated.
9.2.3.32.1	"Agne sahâsâkṣa" (RV 8.48.1).
9.2.3.32.2	He is the thousand-eyed one with golden pieces.
9.2.3.32.3	"Sahasramûrdhann" (RV 6.47.1).
9.2.3.32.4	The hundred-headed Rudra was created from him.
9.2.3.32.5	"Your hundred breaths and thousand circulating breaths."
9.2.3.32.6	Indeed, his hundred breaths and thousand breaths are those of the hundred-headed one.
9.2.3.32.7	"You are the lord of a thousand riches."
9.2.3.32.8	You are the lord over all riches.
9.2.3.32.9	Thus, we offer to you for that strength, svāhā.
9.2.3.32.10	This indeed is strength.
9.2.3.32.11	He thus pleases him.
9.2.3.33.1	He offers with two (verses).
9.2.3.33.2	The Sacrificer has two feet.
9.2.3.33.3	The Sacrificer is Agni.
9.2.3.33.4	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with so much he thus offers him.
9.2.3.34.1	Then he places him (in the fire-place) with the formula, "Thou art the bird, the Garutman."
9.2.3.34.2	Here he makes him, having been cut, into the bird, the Garuda.
9.2.3.34.3	He makes the Garutmān Suparna.
9.2.3.34.4	Having made the Garutmān, he places it at the end.
9.2.3.34.5	"Sit on the back of the earth."
9.2.3.34.6	"Fill the atmosphere with light."
9.2.3.34.7	"Illuminate the heaven with light."
9.2.3.34.8	Illuminate the directions with brilliance."
9.2.3.34.9	Thus indeed, he does all this.
9.2.3.35.1	"He offers, the well-directed one in front."
9.2.3.35.2-8	"He who is well-directed, he who is well-disposed, he who is good, he who is the best, he who is most excellent, he who is supreme, he who is highest, he who is foremost, he who is nearest, he who is closest, he who is best, he who has the best, he is the best, the best of all, the best of the gods, the best of men, the best of cattle, the best of horses, the best of sheep, the best of goats, the best of birds, the best of beasts, the best of trees, the best of plants, the best of grasses, the best of grains, the best of fruits, the best of flowers, the best of tastes, the best of smells, the best of touch, the best of sounds, the best of lights, the best of shadows, the best of darkness, the best of brightness, the best of heat, the best of cold, the best of wind, the best of rain, the best of clouds, the best of lightning, the best of thunder, the best of stars, the best of planets, the best of constellations, the best of seasons, the best of months, the best of days, the best of nights, the best of times, the best of places, the best of directions, the best of beings, the best of gods, the best, the supreme, the highest, the foremost, the nearest, the closest, the best, he has the best, the most excellent, the most excellent of all, the most excellent among the gods, the most excellent in the world of men, the most excellent cattle, the most excellent horses, the most excellent sheep, the most excellent goats, the most excellent birds, the most
9.2.3.35.9	Then the world of gods, together with the sacrificer, settles down.
9.2.3.35.10	He places it with two (verses).
9.2.3.35.11	Its relation is told.
9.2.3.35.12	With the Vasat-utterance.
9.2.3.35.13	Its relation is above.
9.2.3.36.1	Then he puts the kindling woods on it.
9.2.3.36.2	The gods, having approached him, satisfied him from above with food, with kindling woods and oblations.
9.2.3.36.3	In the same way, he now satisfies him with food above, with the kindling woods and oblations.
9.2.3.37.1	He first places the kindling wood of the śamī tree.
9.2.3.37.2	This is what he was burning when the oblation was offered.
9.2.3.37.3	The gods were afraid of him, thinking, "He might harm us."
9.2.3.37.4	They saw this Shami tree.
9.2.3.37.5	They appeased him with it.
9.2.3.37.6	Because they appeased him with this Shami tree, it is called Shami.
9.2.3.37.7	In the same way, he now appeases him with this Shamyā, for appeasement, not for injury.
9.2.3.38.1	I choose the variegated, most excellent, and auspicious blessing of Savitar, the universal, which Kanva milked in abundance, the cow of a thousand streams, with milk.
9.2.3.38.2	Kanva saw her.
9.2.3.38.3	She milked for him all his desires with a thousand streams.
9.2.3.38.4	In the same way she milks for the sacrificer all his desires with the thousand streams.
9.2.3.39.1	Then he lays down the Vaikankati brick.
9.2.3.39.2	Its relation has been explained.
9.2.3.39.3	"He recites, "We worship thy supreme birth, O Agni."
9.2.3.39.4	The sky is his supreme birth.
9.2.3.39.5	"We worship thee with praises in the lower abode."
9.2.3.39.6	The atmosphere is the lower abode.
9.2.3.39.7	"Thou whom we worship from the womb whence thou hast arisen."
9.2.3.39.8	This is his own womb.
9.2.3.40.6	He thus pleases him with food and cattle.
9.2.3.40.7	If one does not find a cow with hanging ears, one should offer it after putting a drop of curds.
9.2.3.40.8	That it stands up as a drop of curded milk, that is the form of an animal.
9.2.3.40.9	"He places it with the verse, "O Agni, shine forth in front," for Viraj.
9.2.3.40.10	Viraj is food.
9.2.3.40.11	He thus pleases him with the food.
9.2.3.40.12	He puts in three fire-sticks.
9.2.3.40.13	Agni is threefold.
9.2.3.40.14	He thus pleases him with as much food as Agni is and as much as his measure is.
9.2.3.41.1	Then he offers oblations.
9.2.3.41.2	It is as if one were to serve food after having turned around.
9.2.3.41.3	With the ladle he offers the eastern one with the western one. Today, O Agni, with praises, may I prosper in the sacrifice, in the good, in the heart-touching, with your Ohas.
9.2.3.41.4	This means, 'May I prosper in the praise that touches your heart.'
9.2.3.41.5	He offers with the Paṅkti verse.
9.2.3.41.6	The Paṅkti verse has five feet.
9.2.3.41.7	Agni has five layers.
9.2.3.41.8	The year has five seasons.
9.2.3.41.9	The year is Agni.
9.2.3.41.10	He thus pleases him with as much food as Agni is and as much as his measure is.
9.2.3.42.1	Then he offers to Visvakarman.
9.2.3.42.2	This Agni is Visvakarman;
9.2.3.42.3	he thus pleases him.
9.2.3.42.4	I offer the mind,
9.2.3.42.5	with ghee and the mind.
9.2.3.42.6	I offer their minds with ghee and with the mind. This is it.
9.2.3.42.7	"As the gods have come here."
9.2.3.42.8	"As the Gods have come here." This is it.  
9.2.3.42.9	"Vitihotra, the one who increases truth."
9.2.3.42.10	"The one who increases truth" is what this means.
9.2.3.42.11	"I offer to the lord of all worlds, to the one of all deeds."
9.2.3.42.12	To him, the lord of all beings, I offer this oblation. This is what it means.
9.2.3.42.13	The oblation is for Visvahā and Ādābhya.
9.2.3.42.14	This means that the oblation is always safe.
9.2.3.43.1	Then he offers the full oblation.
9.2.3.43.2	This is everything that is full. He pleases him with everything.
9.2.3.44.1	Seven are your kindling woods, O Agni.
9.2.3.44.2	Kindling woods are the vital breaths.
9.2.3.44.3	The vital airs kindle him.
9.2.3.44.4	"Seven tongues."
9.2.3.44.5	He says this of those seven men whom he made into one man.
9.2.3.44.6	"Seven sages."
9.2.3.44.7	For they were seven sages.
9.2.3.44.8	"Seven abodes, dear ones."
9.2.3.44.9	He says of the metres.
9.2.3.44.10	The metres are his seven abodes, dear.
9.2.3.44.11	"The seven Hotr priests worship you in seven ways."
9.2.3.44.12	For the seven Hotr priests indeed worship him in seven ways.
9.2.3.44.13	"The seven wombs."
9.2.3.44.14	This refers to the sacrificial posts.
9.2.3.44.15	"Be filled."
9.2.3.44.16	This means "Beget offspring."
9.2.3.44.17	"With ghee."
9.2.3.44.18	Ghee is semen.
9.2.3.44.19	He thus places semen in these worlds.
9.2.3.44.20	"Svāhā."
9.2.3.44.21	Sacrifice is the form of Svāhā.
9.2.3.44.22	He thus makes this sacrifice complete in one stroke.
9.2.3.45.1	He says seven times.
9.2.3.45.2	Agni has seven layers.
9.2.3.45.3	The year has seven seasons.
9.2.3.45.4	The year is Agni.
9.2.3.45.5	He thus pleases him with as much as Agni is and as much as his measure is.
9.2.3.45.6	He offers three oblations.
9.2.3.45.7	Agni is three-fold.
9.2.3.45.8	He thus pleases him with as much food as Agni is and as much as his measure is.
9.2.3.45.9	He puts in three kindling-sticks.
9.2.3.45.10	That makes six.
9.2.3.45.11	Its significance has been explained.
9.2.3.46.1	He puts the kindling-sticks in while standing.
9.2.3.46.2	The kindling-sticks are bones.
9.2.3.46.3	Bones are indeed like standing.
9.2.3.46.4	He offers the oblations while seated.
9.2.3.46.5	Or the flesh-offerings.
9.2.3.46.6	The flesh-offerings are as it were.
9.2.3.46.7	The kindling-sticks are within.
9.2.3.46.8	The offerings are outside.
9.2.3.46.9	For the bones are within,
9.2.3.46.10	and the flesh outside.
9.2.3.47.1	Now then, the prosperity itself.
9.2.3.47.2	He offers six times in front and six times above.
9.2.3.47.3	With six (offerings) they go to the stone of the Pṛśni.
9.2.3.47.4	With two (bricks) he lays down the dark stone.
9.2.3.47.5	With four (bricks) they proceed to Agni.
9.2.3.47.6	With five (bricks) they ascend Agni.
9.2.3.47.7	That is one less than thirty.
9.2.3.47.8	The oblation is the thirtieth.
9.2.3.47.9	With two (bricks) one lays down Agni.
9.2.3.47.10	That makes thirty-two.
9.2.3.47.11	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
9.2.3.47.12	This is the Anushtubh.
9.2.3.48.1	Those three Anushtubh verses which are recited at the Garhapatya, they bring this one here.
9.2.3.48.2	When they bring this one, then all the Agni is here.
9.2.3.48.3	He thought, "It is not proper for me to eat food here."
9.2.3.49.1	He said to Agni, "You have taken away the food."
9.2.3.49.2	He said, "Yes."
9.2.3.49.3	Therefore, as soon as they bring him here, he is enough for food and enough for the oblations.
9.2.3.50.1	They also say, "Prajapati himself placed this dear son on his lap."
9.2.3.50.2	He who knows this indeed places a dear son on his chest.
9.2.3.51.1	Whatever they bring here, that is this (fire).
9.2.3.51.2	When they made those seven men into one man, it is this very one who is being built here.
9.2.3.51.3	And whatever of their upward prosperity, the essence, they brought together, it is this one which they bring here.
9.2.3.51.4	Whatever they bring here, that is the glory and essence of these seven men. They collect it upwards.
9.2.3.51.5	This is his head.
9.2.3.51.6	This Agni is the Self.
9.2.3.51.7	Having thus prepared his own Self, he restores the head.
9.3.1.1.1	Now, he offers to Vaisvānara.
9.3.1.1.2	Herein is this entire Agni prepared.
9.3.1.1.3	This very one is the deity here, Vaiśvānara.
9.3.1.1.4	Therefore he offers this oblation.
9.3.1.1.5	He makes him a deity with the oblation.
9.3.1.1.6	The deity to whom the oblation is offered, that deity is not the one to whom it is not offered.
9.3.1.1.7	Twelve potsherds.
9.3.1.1.8	Twelve months are a year.
9.3.1.1.9	The year is Vaiśvānara.
9.3.1.2.1	When he offers this oblation to Vaiśvānaran,
9.3.1.2.2	he generates the fire Vaiśvānari.
9.3.1.2.3	He pours it down in front of the initiation on the day before, in the form of semen.
9.3.1.2.4	Whatever form the semen is poured in the womb, in that form it is born.
9.3.1.2.5	Now that which is the semen of the fire, he pours down there, therefore this one here is the fire.
9.3.1.2.6	He is born.
9.3.1.2.7	It is whispered there.
9.3.1.2.8	The sacrifice is semen there.
9.3.1.2.9	Semen is indeed poured down in a whisper.
9.3.1.2.10	It is spoken here.
9.3.1.2.11	For semen when born is spoken.
9.3.1.3.1	He who is the fire, these are the worlds.
9.3.1.3.2	This earth alone is the universe.
9.3.1.4.8	Above this is Agni.
9.3.1.5.1	This is the sky.
9.3.1.5.2	Therefore it is hairless.
9.3.1.5.3	For the sky is like hairless.
9.3.1.5.4	This is all.
9.3.1.5.5	The breath itself is the wind.
9.3.1.5.6	He is a man.
9.3.1.5.7	He is in the middle of it.
9.3.1.5.8	For the wind is in the middle.
9.3.1.6.1	The head itself is the sky.
9.3.1.6.2	The stars are the hair.
9.3.1.6.3	This entire universe is that.
9.3.1.6.4	The eye is indeed the sun.
9.3.1.6.5	He is a man.
9.3.1.6.6	It is on the left side of the head.
9.3.1.6.7	Because the sun is on the left of heaven.
9.3.1.6.8	This is his head, the universal man.
9.3.1.6.9	This Agni is the Self.
9.3.1.6.10	Having thus prepared his own self, he places the head back.
9.3.1.7.1	Then he offers to the Maruts.
9.3.1.7.2	The Maruts are the vital airs.
9.3.1.7.3	He thus places the vital airs in him.
9.3.1.7.4	Having offered to Vaisvānara,
9.3.1.7.5	Vaisvānara is the head.
9.3.1.7.6	He thus puts the vital airs in the head.
9.3.1.8.1	It is one.
9.3.1.8.2	For the head is like one.
9.3.1.8.3	The other seven are seven-headed.
9.3.1.9.8	The Prāṇas are indeed as if present.
9.3.1.10.1	He offers the first two Maruts, these are the Prāṇas.
9.3.1.10.2	He offers them in the middle of Vaiśvānara,
9.3.1.10.3	for these are the Prānās in the middle of the head.
9.3.1.11.1	Then the second two, these are them.
9.3.1.11.2	He offers these closer together,
9.3.1.11.3	for these Prāṇas seem to be closer together.
9.3.1.12.1	Then the third two, these are they.
9.3.1.12.2	He offers them at a greater distance.
9.3.1.12.3	For the two vital airs are indeed at a greater distance from each other.
9.3.1.12.4	Speech alone is to be uttered in the forest.
9.3.1.12.5	He becomes one whose speech is to be uttered only in the forest. For
9.3.1.12.6	speech causes much harm.
9.3.1.13.1	When he offers to Vaisvânara and Maruts,
9.3.1.13.2	Vaisvânara is indeed the nobility,
9.3.1.13.3	and the Maruts are the people.
9.3.1.13.4	He makes it both nobility and people.
9.3.1.13.5	He offers to Vaisvânara first.
9.3.1.13.6	Having made it a Kshatra, he makes it a Vish.
9.3.1.14.1	It is one.
9.3.1.14.2	He makes the Kshatra one-standing, and the Shri one-standing.
9.3.1.14.3	The others are many.
9.3.1.14.4	He makes it a Vish, and establishes it in the earth.
9.3.1.15.1	It is a Nirukta (i.e. a word with a meaning).
9.3.1.15.2	For the Kshatra is like a Nirukta.
9.3.1.15.3	The others (words) are Anirukta (i,e. words without a meaning).
9.3.1.15.4	The Vish is like an Anirukta.
9.3.1.15.5	Standing, he offers this (oblation).
9.3.1.15.6	For the Kshatra is indeed standing.
9.3.1.15.7	He offers the others while seated.
9.3.1.15.8	For the Vaisya is indeed seated.
9.3.1.16.1	He offers this (oblution) with the ladle at the Vasat-call, accompanied by the Puronuvākyā and the Yājyā.
9.3.1.16.2	He offers others with his hand while seated, with the Svāhā-call.
9.3.1.16.3	He makes the Vaisya follow the Kshatra, to be obedient and submissive.
9.3.1.17.1	They say, how are these (verses) with Puronuvākyā and Yājyā, offered with the Sruva at the Vasat-utterance?
9.3.1.17.2	Of these seven-footed Maruts, the first three feet are the Triṣṭubh Puronuvākyatā.
9.3.1.17.3	And the last four feet are the Catuṣpadas Triṣṭubha Yājyā.
9.3.1.17.4	This is the only difference.
9.3.1.17.5	This is the staff.
9.3.1.17.6	Svāhā-form, Vaṣaṭ-form.
9.3.1.17.7	Thus indeed, these (offerings) are accompanied by the Puronuvākyā and Yājyā, and are offered with the Sruva at the Vaṣaṭkāra.
9.3.1.18.1	That which he first offers to the south, to Māruta, that is the seven streams flowing eastwards.
9.3.1.18.2	It is offered on seven potsherds.
9.3.1.18.3	For seven are the rivers that flow eastward.
9.3.1.19.1	The first oblation that is offered to the north is the seasons.
9.3.1.19.2	It is offered on seven potsherds.
9.3.1.19.3	For there are seven seasons.
9.3.1.20.1	The second oblation that is made to the south is the cattle.
9.3.1.20.2	It is also offered on seven potshers.
9.3.1.20.3	For there is seven kinds of domestic animals.
9.3.1.20.4	It is made without interruption from the first oblation.
9.3.1.20.5	He establishes the animals in the waters.
9.3.1.21.1	Then the second oblation which he offers towards the north, that is the seven sages.
9.3.1.21.2	It is offered on seven potsherds.
9.3.1.21.3	For there are seven sages.
9.3.1.21.4	He offers it without interruption from the former one.
9.3.1.21.5	He establishes the sages in the seasons.
9.3.1.22.1	Then the third oblation which he makes towards the south, that is the vital airs.
9.3.1.22.2	It is offered on seven potsherds.
9.3.1.22.3	For there are seven vital airs in the head.
9.3.1.22.4	He offers it without interruption from the former one.
9.3.1.22.5	He thus places the vital airs of the head without interruption.
9.3.1.23.1	Then the one which he offers third from the north, that is the metres.
9.3.1.23.2	It is offered on seven potsheds.
9.3.1.23.3	For there is a group of seven metres.
9.3.1.23.4	He offers them without interruption from the previous one.
9.3.1.23.5	The Rsis, the metres, are not separated from it.
9.3.1.24.1	And those seven which flow towards the west, that is the forest, that is the one to be known.
9.3.1.24.2	It is with seven potsherds.
9.3.1.24.3	For those seven which flow to the west, they are.
9.3.1.24.4	This is his downward-moving breath.
9.3.1.24.5	That is the forest, the one to be know, of Prajapati.
9.3.1.24.6	The forest is like the other world.
9.3.1.24.7	The downward-moving breath is like the otherworld.
9.3.1.24.8	Therefore, those who drink the water of these rivers become more quarrelsome, more quarrelsome, and more quarrelsome.
9.3.1.24.9	Whatever he says here, he makes it food for him and then offers it to him, thereby pleasing him.
9.3.1.25.1	He who is Vaiśvānara, he is the sun.
9.3.1.25.2	And those Maruts are the rays.
9.3.1.25.3	They are seven, with seven skulls.
9.3.1.25.4	For there are seven groups of Maruts.
9.3.1.26.1	He offers to Shukra-jyotis, Citra-jyotih, Satya-jyotih and Jyotisman.
9.3.1.26.2	These are their names.
9.3.1.26.3	Having thus prepared the Mandala, he places the rays in it with their names.
9.3.2.1.1	Now he offers the stream of Vasu.
9.3.2.1.2	Here this entire Agni is prepared.
9.3.2.1.3	This is indeed Vasu here.
9.3.2.1.4	The gods took up this stream for him.
9.3.2.1.5	With that they pleased him.
9.3.2.1.6	Now, when the Vasus took this stream for him, therefore they call it the stream of Vasu.
9.3.2.1.7	In the same way this one takes this stream for him.
9.3.2.1.8	With that he pleases him.
9.3.2.2.1	Now, when he offers this stream of Vasu,
9.3.2.2.2	it is indeed a consecration for him.
9.3.2.2.3	The gods, having thus made him all-pervading, anointed him with these desires and with this stream of wealth.
9.3.2.2.4	In the same way he now makes him all-pervasive and anoints him with these desires, with this stream of riches.
9.3.2.2.5	With ghee taken five times, with a spoon made of Udumbara wood.
9.3.2.3.8	Then, indeed, he is consecrated in the vital airs.
9.3.2.4.1	That is said to be the forest.
9.3.2.4.2	Speech is said to be forest.
9.3.2.4.3	Food is eaten by speech.
9.3.2.4.4	Then, indeed, he who is consecrated is consecrated by speech.
9.3.2.4.5	That is all wealth.
9.3.2.4.6	For all these are desires.
9.3.2.4.7	This is the stream of wealth, just as milk or ghee is poured out. In the same way, this offering of ghee is poured out from the beginning.
9.3.2.4.8	Because it is a stream of wealth, they call it "stream of wealth."
9.3.2.5.1	He says, "This is mine and this is mine."
9.3.2.5.2	I please you with this and with that.
9.3.2.5.3	"With this and with that I consecrate thee." This is what it means.
9.3.2.5.4	"And give me this and that."
9.3.2.5.5	When this stream of water reaches the fire, then he should recite this formula.
9.3.2.6.1	The gods, having pleased him with this food, anointed him with these desires, and with this stream of wealth, then they requested him for these desires.
9.3.2.6.2	He, being pleased and anointed, granted them these desires.
9.3.2.6.3	In the same way, he now pleases him with this food, consecrates him with these desires, and with this stream of wealth, and then asks him for these desires.
9.3.2.6.4	Therefore, being pleased and consecrated, he grants these desires.
9.3.2.6.5	He unites two by two desires for non-separation, saying, "May the sacrifices be united like the two oceans."
9.3.2.7.1	The gods said, "By what shall we receive these desires?"
9.3.2.7.2	They said, "By ourselves."
9.3.2.7.3	Sacrifice is the self of the gods.
9.3.2.7.4	Sacrifice is also the self of the sacrificer.
9.3.2.7.5	When he says, "May they be accomplished by sacrifice," he means, "May they (be accomplished) by myself."
9.3.2.8.1	He arranges them in twelve (rows).
9.3.2.8.2	The year has twelve months.
9.3.3.1.1	Then he offers these sacrificial rites, saying, "May Agni and Gharma be mine."
9.3.3.1.2	He thus propitiates him with these sacrificial rites.
9.3.3.1.3	And thus he consecrates him with these sacrificial acts.
9.3.3.2.1	Then he offers the Stoma-rites.
9.3.3.2.2	The gods, having obtained all their desires, went to the heavenly world with the odd Stotras.
9.3.3.2.3	And thus the sacrificer, having obtained all his desires, goes to the heavenly world.
9.3.3.3.1	It is indeed from the Trayastrimsa.
9.3.3.3.2	The Trayastrimsa is the end of the odd Stotras.
9.3.3.3.3	The gods, indeed, went to heaven at the very end.
9.3.3.3.4	In the same way, the sacrificer goes to heaven at the end.
9.3.3.4.1	Then he offers in pairs.
9.3.3.4.2	The metres indeed said, "The odd Stomas are exhausted.
9.3.3.4.3	We shall go to heaven by even Stomas."
9.3.3.4.4	They went to the heavenly world with the Stomas in pairs.
9.3.3.4.5	In the same way the Sacrificer goes to the heavenly world by the Stomas in pair.
9.3.3.5.1	That is the forty-eight.
9.3.3.5.2	The forty-eight is the end of the Stomas in the form of pairs.
9.3.3.5.3	The metres went to the heavenly worlds from the end.
9.3.3.5.4	Then indeed the sacrificer goes to heaven at the very end.
9.3.3.6.1	He says, "One is mine, three are mine, four are mine, eight are mine."
9.3.3.6.2	Just as one climbing a tree climbs higher and higher branches, so is it.
9.3.3.6.3	In that he offers the Stoma-s.
9.3.3.6.4	Stoma-s are food.
9.3.3.6.5	He anoints him with food alone.
9.3.3.7.1	Then he offers the oblations to the Vyasas.
9.3.3.7.2	The Vyasas are animals.
9.3.3.7.3	He thus pleases him with food and animals.
9.3.3.7.4	And he anoints him with animals and food.
9.3.3.8.1	Then he makes an offering to the one who is known by name.
9.3.3.8.2	The gods, having obtained all their desires, then gratified him directly.
9.3.3.8.3	In the same way, the sacrificer, having obtained all his desires, then gratifies him directly.
9.3.3.8.4	"To Vaja, svāhā! To Prasava, svāhā!" These are his names.
9.3.3.8.5	He gratifies him by means of his names.
9.3.3.9.1	There are thirteen names.
9.3.3.9.2	Thirteen months are a year.
9.3.3.9.3	Thirteen are the ashes of Agni.
9.3.3.9.4	He thus pleases him with as much as Agni is and as much as his measure is.
9.3.3.9.5	When he offers the name-grabbing oblation,
9.3.3.9.6	he thus anoints him with the name-grabs.
9.3.3.10.1	Then he says, "This is your rule."
9.3.3.10.2	You are the controller for Mitra, the controller.
9.3.3.10.3	"For Urdh (the sky), for rain, for the lordship of creatures."
9.3.3.10.4	Food is Urdh.
9.3.3.10.5	Food is rain.
9.3.3.10.6	He thus pleases him with food.
9.3.3.11.1	"He says, 'You are the king of this, you are the king of that, you are the lord of this, you have been anointed as the king of this.' He says, 'For Urdh, for rain, for lordship of creatures.'
9.3.3.11.2	You are the controller of Mitra.
9.3.3.11.3	You are for our prosperity.
9.3.3.11.4	You are also for our rain.
9.3.3.11.5	You are the lord of our progeny.
9.3.3.11.6	He says to him, "You are for us all."
9.3.3.11.7	We anoint you for all this.
9.3.3.11.8	Therefore, they address the anointed human king.
9.3.3.12.1	Then he offers the Kalpas.
9.3.3.12.2	The Kalpas are the vital airs.
9.3.3.12.3	He thus places the vital airs in him.
9.3.3.12.4	May life be established by the sacrifice.
9.3.3.12.5	May the vital air be established by the rite.
9.3.3.12.6	He thus establishes in him the established vital airs.
9.3.3.13.1	He offers twelve times.
9.3.3.13.2	Twelve months are a year.
9.3.3.13.3	The year is Agni.
9.3.3.13.4	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with so much he places the installed life-breaths in him.
9.3.3.13.5	In that he offers twelve times,
9.3.3.13.6	the life-breaths are the twelve times.
9.3.3.13.7	The life-breaths indeed are immortality.
9.3.3.13.8	He anoints him with nectar alone.
9.3.3.14.1	Then he says, "Stoma, Yajus, Rik, Sama, Brihat, and Rathantara."
9.3.3.14.2	This is indeed the threefold knowledge.
9.3.3.14.3	The threefold knowledge is indeed food.
9.3.3.14.4	He pleases him with food.
9.3.3.14.5	He anoints him with food. "
9.3.3.14.6	The gods have attained heaven.
9.3.3.14.7	"I have become immortal."
9.3.3.14.8	One goes to heaven.
9.3.3.14.9	One becomes immortal.
9.3.3.14.10	"I have become the offspring of Prajapati."
9.3.3.14.11	One becomes the offspring of Prajapatī.
9.3.3.14.12	"Veda svāhā."
9.3.3.14.13	This is the indirect form of the word "vasat."
9.3.3.14.14	Food is offered to the gods either by the word "vasa" or by the word "svāhā".
9.3.3.14.15	He pleases him with both of these, with the Vasat-call and the Svāhā-call. And with these two he anoints him.
9.3.3.14.16	Here he places the ladle, lest what is smeared with ghee should fall outside the fire.
9.3.3.15.1	The sky itself is the body, the cloud is the udder, the lightning is the teat, and the stream is the stream.
9.3.3.15.2	It comes to the cow from the sky.
9.3.3.16.1	The cow itself is the body; the udder is the udder; the teat is the teat; and the stream is indeed the stream.
9.3.3.16.2	The sacrificer comes to the cow.
9.3.3.17.1	The sacrificers himself is the body, his arm is the udder. The ladle is the teat, the stream is indeed a stream.
9.3.3.17.2	From the sacrificer, the gods.
9.3.3.17.3	From the gods, the cow.
9.3.3.17.4	From the cow, the sacrificer.
9.3.3.17.5	This is the endless, inexhaustible food of the gods, which circulates.
9.3.3.17.6	He who knows this thus, for him this becomes endless, inexhaustible food.
9.3.3.17.7	Now, then, the prosperity itself.
9.3.3.18.1	They say, how does this stream of Soma reach the fire in a year?
9.3.3.18.2	How does it become united with the fire in a whole year?
9.3.3.18.3	This stream of Soma is sixty-three hundred, then six, then thirty-five.
9.3.3.18.4	Then he obtains the number of days in a year, which is sixty-three hundred.
9.3.3.18.5	Then he obtains the number (of days) in the seasons, which are six.
9.3.3.18.6	Then he attains the number of days and nights in a year.
9.3.3.18.7	Then the thirty-five (days) are the thirteenth month.
9.3.3.18.8	That is the Self.
9.3.3.18.9	The Self is thirty.
9.3.3.18.10	Two are the foundations.
9.3.3.18.11	Two are breaths.
9.3.3.18.12	The head alone is the thirty-fifth.
9.3.3.18.13	This is the year.
9.3.3.18.14	Thus indeed, he attains the fire for a year through this stream of wealth.
9.3.3.18.15	Thus he attains the fire through the year.
9.3.3.18.16	In the Sandilā fire, these many bricks are laid down in the middle, having mantras.
9.3.3.18.17	These fires are indeed separate, because these bricks are separate.
9.3.3.18.18	Thus indeed, these fires of him are offered separately with the stream of Soma.
9.3.3.19.1	They say, how does this stream of Soma attain the great praise?
9.3.3.19.2	How does one attain the great recitation?
9.3.3.19.3	Of this very Vasordhara, the first nine mantras are the three-headed head.
9.3.3.19.4	Then the forty-eight are the two twenty-four wings.
9.3.3.19.5	Then the twenty-five are the twenty-five self.
9.3.3.19.6	Then the twenty-one (verses) are the twenty-one-fold tail.
9.3.3.19.7	Then the thirty-three (verses) are his control.
9.3.3.19.8	Then the eighty (verses) are indeed the attainment of the eighty.
9.3.3.19.9	For the great hymn is called the eighty.
9.3.3.19.10	Then what is above the eighty, that is indeed the great hymn above the eighty.
9.3.3.19.11	Thus indeed does he attain the great praise of the stream of Soma.
9.3.3.19.12	Thus he attains the great praise.
9.3.4.1.1	Now indeed he offers the Vaja-prasavini (oblation).
9.3.4.1.2	Food indeed is Vaja.
9.3.4.1.3	This is the oblation for the attainment of food.
9.3.4.1.4	He thus causes food to be attained by him.
9.3.4.2.1	The gods, having pleased him with this food, anointed him with these desires, and with this stream of wealth, then they further pleased him.
9.3.4.2.2	In the same way he now pleases him with this food and anoints him with these desires and with this stream, and then further pleases him.
9.3.4.3.1	Now, when he offers the Vājaprasavīya oblation,
9.3.4.3.2	it is indeed a consecration of him.
9.3.4.3.3	The gods, having pleased him with this food, consecrated him with these desires and with this stream of Soma, and then they consecrated him further.
9.3.4.3.4	In the same way, he now pleases him with this food and consecrates him with these desires and with this stream of ghee. Then he consecrates him again with this (food).
9.3.4.4.1	It consists of all herbs.
9.3.4.4.2	All this is food which consists of all herbs;
9.3.4.4.3	He thus pleases him with all food.
9.3.4.4.4	Then he anoints him with all the food.
9.3.4.4.5	Of these, one should take out the food and not eat it as long as he lives.
9.3.4.4.6	With a wooden vessel and a wooden ladle.
9.3.4.4.7	The relationship of these two is stated.
9.3.4.4.8	They have four corners.
9.3.4.4.9	There are four directions.
9.3.4.4.10	He thus propitiates him with food from all directions.
9.3.4.4.11	And he thus anoints him with food from the directions.
9.3.4.5.1	When he offers the Vājaprasavīya oblation,
9.3.4.5.2	it is these deities that are gratified by the libation with which he is about to offer.
9.3.4.5.3	They, being pleased and satisfied, consent to this sacrifice.
9.3.4.5.4	He who is consented to by them, he prospers.
9.3.4.5.5	He who the kings consent to for the kingdom, he becomes the king, not he whom they do not consent to.
9.3.4.5.6	When he offers in the fire, he consecrates the fire.
9.3.4.5.7	Now when he offers to these deities, he thereby pleases those deities who preside over this sacrifice.
9.3.4.6.1	And indeed he also offers to the Parthivas.
9.3.4.6.2	The gods indeed desired: "May we perform all the sacrifices here itself."
9.3.4.6.3	They performed all the sacrifices here.
9.3.4.6.4	In the same way, the sacrificer here performs all the sacrifices.
9.3.4.7.1	Those which are the Parthani (sacrifices), they are the Vaja-prasaviya of the Rajasuya.
9.3.4.7.2	When he offers them, he performs the Rajasuya sacrifice.
9.3.4.7.3	Then those fourteen which are the subsequent ones and those seven which are the earlier ones, they are the Vāja-prasaviya for the Vājapeya.
9.3.4.7.4	When he offers those (oblations), then he performs the Vājapeya.
9.3.4.7.5	And those seven additional ones are of Agni.
9.3.4.7.6	When he offers those (additional oblations), then he (performs) the Agnisava.
9.3.4.8.1	He offers the oblations of the Rajasuya first, then of the Vājapeva.
9.3.4.8.2	Having performed the Rajasuya, one becomes a king; having performed the Vājape ya, one becomes a supreme king.
9.3.4.8.3	First one attains kingship, then supreme kingship.
9.3.4.8.4	Therefore, having performed the Vājapeya, one should not perform the Rājasūya.
9.3.4.8.5	This is the reversal.
9.3.4.8.6	As one would be a king while being an emperor, so it is.
9.3.4.9.1	One offers the last oblations to Agni.
9.3.4.9.2	All these are indeed the oblations, namely the Agni oblations.
9.3.4.9.3	All this becomes accomplished through the Agni oblations, namely both the king and the emperor.
9.3.4.9.4	Therefore, one offers the last oblatioins to Agni.
9.3.4.10.1	Then he consecrates him with a black antelope skin.
9.3.4.10.2	The black antelope skin is indeed the sacrifice.
9.3.4.10.3	He consecrates him with the sacrifice.
9.3.4.10.4	From the hair.
9.3.4.10.5	The hair is indeed the metres.
9.3.4.10.6	He consecbrates him with the metres.
9.3.4.10.7	From the north.
9.3.4.10.8	His friend is above it.
9.3.4.10.9	With the neck turned towards the east.
9.3.4.10.10	That is indeed divine.
9.3.4.11.1	Some consecrate him to the south of the fire, for the offering of food is made to the south.
9.3.4.11.2	"They say, "We shall consecrate him from half of the food."
9.3.4.11.3	One should not do so.
9.3.4.11.4	This is the direction of the ancestors.
9.3.4.11.5	He who is consecrated thus quickly goes to that direction.
9.3.4.12.1	Some sprinkle him at the Ahavaniya fire. The Ahavaniya fire is the heavenly world.
9.3.4.12.2	"They sprinkle him in the heavenly world."
9.3.4.12.3	One should not do so.
9.3.4.12.4	This is his divine self, that is his human self.
9.3.4.12.5	Those who sprinkle him thus, they make his mortal self to follow his divine self.
9.3.4.14.4	The one who desires to shine should place it thus.
9.3.4.14.5	One desiring prosperity should anoint it with a woolen cloth.
9.3.4.14.6	One desiring brahmic glory should anoint it on a black antelope skin.
9.3.4.14.7	One desiring both should anoint it in both.
9.3.4.14.8	He spreads it north of the tail, with the hair pointing north and the neck towards the east.
9.3.4.15.1	It is untouched, surrounded by a border.
9.3.4.15.2	When he touches the black antelope skin, he becomes surrounded by it. Thus this divine self is consecrated in the black antelope skin.
9.3.4.15.3	And when he consecrates him standing near the fire, thus he is not separated from this divine consecration.
9.3.4.16.1	Having offered into the fire, he then consecrates him.
9.3.4.16.2	This is his divine self, this is his human self.
9.3.4.16.3	The gods came first, then the men.
9.3.4.16.4	Therefore, having offered in the fire, he consecrates him with the remaining part of that.
9.3.4.16.5	Here he places the ladle.
9.3.4.17.1	Then he anoints him, having turned his right arm around, with the verse, "In the impulse of the divine Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, with the instrument of Sarasvati, the controller of speech, with the sovereignty of Agni, I anoint thee."
9.3.4.17.2	Sarasvati is speech.
9.3.4.17.3	This is her entire instrument.
9.3.4.17.4	He consecrates him with the Sarasvati, the controller of speech, with the instrument, with the sovereignty of Agni, which is generated by Savitr.
9.3.4.17.5	Here he places the cup, thinking, "Whatever is smeared here, may it not be outside Agni."
9.3.4.18.1	He consecrates him in the middle of the Parthani.
9.3.4.18.2	The Parthani are the year.
9.3.4.18.3	He thus places him in the middle of the year.
9.3.4.18.4	He offers six times in front and six times above.
9.3.4.18.5	There are six seasons.
9.3.4.18.6	He thus encloses him on both sides while being purified by the seasons.
9.3.4.18.7	Brihaspati is the last of the former ones.
9.3.4.18.8	Indra is the first of the latter ones.
9.3.4.18.9	Brihas pati is Brahman.
9.3.4.18.10	Indra is the Kshatra.
9.3.4.18.11	Brahma and Kshatra both protect him who is being pressed.
9.4.1.1.1	Now, he offers to the Rāṣṭrabhṛts.
9.4.1.1.2	The Rāṣṭrabṛts are the kings.
9.4.1.1.3	They indeed support the kingdoms.
9.4.1.1.4	These are the deities who are being pressed with this pressing with which one is going to be pressed.
9.4.1.1.5	He thus pleases them.
9.4.1.1.6	They, being pleased and satisfied, consent to this sacrifice.
9.4.1.1.7	He offers with their consent.
9.4.1.1.8	He who the kings consent to rule, he becomes a king, not he whom they do not consent to.
9.4.1.1.9	In that the kings rule over the kingdoms, these are the ruling gods, therefore they are the rulers of kingdoms.
9.4.1.2.1	In that he offers to these rulers of kingdoms,
9.4.1.2.2	The pairs of Prajapati, when released, came forth as Gandharvas and Apsarasas.
9.4.1.2.3	They became a chariot and wandered around.
9.4.1.2.4	Having wandered around them, he placed them in himself, he made them in himself.
9.4.1.2.5	In the same way, he now places them in himself, makes them in himself.
9.4.1.3.1	He who is this Prajapati, when he fell down, he is the same Agni who is being piled up here.
9.4.1.3.2	And those which came out from him, they are the same as the deities to whom he offers.
9.4.1.4.1	He offers to Gandharvas and Apsarases.
9.4.1.4.2	For having become Gandharvas and apsarases, they came out.
9.4.1.5.5	The gods who are in pairs support the kingdom in pairs. Therefore, these are the supporters of the kingdom.
9.4.1.5.6	With twelve spoonfuls of ghee.
9.4.1.5.7	There are twelve oblations.
9.4.1.5.8	Its relationship is explained.
9.4.1.6.1	One offers to the male first, then to the female.
9.4.1.6.2	One thus bestows the male with virility.
9.4.1.7.2-9	This is the truth, the abode of truth. Agni is the Gandharva. His herbs are the Apsarases. Agni, the Gandharva, indeed, ascended with the herbs, the Apsarases, in union. The name is "Muda." The herbs are indeed "Muda." For all this is delighted with the herbs. May this Brahman protect the nobility.
9.4.1.7.10	To him, svāhā!
9.4.1.7.11	To them, svāhā!"
9.4.1.7.12	His relationship is mentioned.
9.4.1.8.1	"It is called "Saṃhita"."
9.4.1.8.2	This Aditya is Saṃhita.
9.4.1.8.3	He indeed unites day and night.
9.4.1.8.4	"It says, "Viśvasāme"."
9.4.1.8.5	This indeed is the entire Sama.
9.4.1.8.6	Sūrya is Gandharva.
9.4.1.8.7	His rays are the Apsarases.
9.4.1.8.8	Sūry is Gandharva.
9.4.1.8.9	He went forth with the Maruts, the Apsarases, and the Mithunas.
9.4.1.8.10	The name is Ayavas.
9.4.1.8.11	Because the Maruts move like the Ayavas.
9.4.1.8.12	"May this Brahman protect the kingdom."
9.4.1.8.13	His relationship has been explained.
9.4.1.9.1	The name Susumna.
9.4.1.9.2	This means "good sacrifice."
9.4.1.9.3	The name is Suryarasmi.
9.4.1.9.4	The rays of the moon are like those of the sun.
9.4.1.9.5	The moon is Gandharva.
9.4.1.9.6	His stars are Apsarases.
9.4.1.9.7	The moon, Gandharva, went forth with the stars, the Apsarases, in union.
9.4.1.9.8	They are called Bhakurya.
9.4.1.9.9	They are indeed called Bhakurya,
9.4.1.9.10	For the stars make the light.
9.4.1.9.11	May this Brahman protect the nobility.
9.4.1.9.12	His relation is stated.
9.4.1.10.1	"It is called 'Iṣīra' (the swift one).
9.4.1.10.2	"It is 'Kṣipra' (the quick one).
9.4.1.10.3	" "It is called 'Viśvavyaca' (the creator of all).
9.4.1.10.4	" "Because it creates all this.
9.4.1.10.5	" "It (the wind) is the Gandharva (the celestial musician).
9.4.1.10.6	" "Its Apsarases (celestial nymphs) are the waters.
9.4.1.10.7	" "The Gandharva (wind) united with the Apsarases (waters) and went up.
9.4.1.10.8	" "Its name is 'Ūrja' (nourishment).
9.4.1.10.9	" "The waters are nourishment.
9.4.1.10.10	For energy is born from water.
9.4.1.10.11	"May this Brahman protect the kingdom."
9.4.1.10.12	Its relationship has been explained.
9.4.1.11.1	"Bhujyu is Suparna."
9.4.1.11.2	"Bhujy is indeed the sacrifice."
9.4.1.11.3	For the sacrifice enjoys all beings.
9.4.1.11.4	"The sacrifice is Gandharva."
9.4.1.11.5	Its dakshina is the Apsarasas.
9.4.1.11.6	Sacrifice, indeed, went forth with the Apsarases, the Dakshina, in union.
9.4.1.11.7	They are called Stava.
9.4.1.11.8	Dakshina is Stava, for the sacrifice is praised with Dakshina.
9.4.1.11.9	And he who gives Dakshina is praised.
9.4.1.11.10	"May this Brahman protect the kingdom."
9.4.1.11.11	His relationship has been explained.
9.4.1.12.1	Prajapati is the creator of all.
9.4.1.12.2	Prajapati is the one who creates all.
9.4.1.12.3	He created all this.
9.4.1.12.4	Mind is Gandharva.
9.4.1.12.5	His Rks and Sāmans are the Apsarases.
9.4.1.12.6	Mind, Gandharva, with the Rks and Sāmans, the Apsarases, copulated together.
9.4.1.12.7	The names are Iṣṭayas.
9.4.1.12.8	The Rks and Sämans are the Iṣṭayas.
9.4.1.12.9	"May we be blessed with the Rk and the Sama."
9.4.1.12.10	"May this Brahman protect us, may this Kshatra protect us."
9.4.1.12.11	His relationship has been explained.
9.4.1.13.1	Then he offers at the head of the chariot.
9.4.1.13.2	This indeed is the pressing. This indeed is pressed for him, for whom these deities approve the pressing, by whom he is approved and is pressed.
9.4.1.13.3	The king to whom the other kings give their consent, he alone becomes the king, not the one to whom they do not give their consent.
9.4.1.13.4	With ghee taken five times.
9.4.1.13.5	Those are the five oblations that are offered.
9.4.1.13.6	Its relation has been stated.
9.4.1.14.1	From the head.
9.4.1.14.2	One is consecrated from the head when the head is held above.
9.4.1.14.3	For it is above that he consecrates him.
9.4.1.14.4	With the same mantra.
9.4.1.14.5	For he anoints him with the same.
9.4.1.14.6	All around.
9.4.1.14.7	He anoints him all around.
9.4.1.15.1	And why he offers on the chariot-head,
9.4.1.15.2	This is the sun, that is the chariot.
9.4.1.15.3	Having made this form, Prajapati having surrounded these pairs, placed them in himself, made them in himself.
9.4.1.15.4	In the same way, he who has taken these pairs, places them in himself, makes them in himself.
9.4.1.15.5	When placed above.
9.4.1.15.6	For he who has taken those pairs, places them above, makes them above.
9.4.1.15.7	With the same mantra.
9.4.1.15.8	For he, who has taken those couples, places them in the same way, makes them in the same.
9.4.1.15.9	All around.
9.4.1.15.10	For he, having taken these pairs, has placed them in himself, has made them his own.
9.4.1.16.1	"O Lord of the world, O Prajapati!"
9.4.1.16.2	For he is indeed the lord of the world, Prajapati.
9.4.1.16.3	"Whose houses are above, whose here?"
9.4.1.16.4	For his houses are above and here.
9.4.1.16.5	"To this Brahman, to this Kshatra!"
9.4.1.16.6	This Agni is indeed Brahman and Kshatra.
9.4.1.16.7	"Mahas, grant protection! Svāhā!"
9.4.1.16.8	This means "Grant great protection! Svāha!"
9.4.2.1.1	Then he offers the Vātahoma oblations.
9.4.2.1.2	These worlds are indeed this Agni.
9.4.2.1.3	Vāyu is the Vātahomah oblations.
9.4.2.1.4	He places Vāyu in these worlds.
9.4.2.1.5	Therefore Vāyu is here in these worlds.
9.4.2.4.1	with folded hands.
9.4.2.4.2	For there is no intention of his coming here.
9.4.2.4.3	With the exclamation "Svāhā!"
9.4.2.4.4	For he offers the oblation downward and downward.
9.4.2.4.5	This is the chariot of the sun.
9.4.2.4.6	He places the wind behind the sun.
9.4.2.4.7	Therefore it blows from here only.
9.4.2.5.1	"You are the ocean, the shining one."
9.4.2.5.2	This world is the ocean, the shining one.
9.4.2.5.3	"It is said, "The one who gives moisture."
9.4.2.5.4	For he gives moisture.
9.4.2.5.5	He places in this world the wind that is in the other world.
9.4.2.5.6	"He says, "May the auspicious one, the one who gives, carry me. Svāhā!"
9.4.2.5.7	This means, "May the benevolent one, the one giving, carry me."
9.4.2.6.1	You are the wind, the group of winds.
9.4.2.6.2	The wind in the sky is the group of winds,
9.4.2.6.3	That wind in the sky he places in this (wind).
9.4.2.6.4	"May I be auspicious, may I be prosperous, may you blow towards me, svāhā."
9.4.2.6.5	"May I have peace, may I have prosperity, may you blow toward me."
9.4.2.7.1	"You are the wind, you are the wind."
9.4.2.7.2	This world is the wind, the blower.
9.4.2.7.3	He places it in this world, that which is the wind in this world.
9.4.2.7.4	"He offers with, "May it be auspicious, may it be prosperous, may it carry me forward, svāhā."
9.4.2.7.5	"It means, "May be auspicious, may be prosperous, may carry me forward."
9.4.2.8.1	He offers with three (verses).
9.4.2.8.2	These are the three worlds.
9.4.2.8.3	And Agni is threefold.
9.4.2.8.4	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with that much he places the wind in them.
9.4.2.9.1	And why he offers the Vāta-homa offerings,
9.4.2.9.2	he yokes this very chariot.
9.4.2.9.3	The gods yoked this chariot to all their desires, saying, "We shall attain by the yoked one."
9.4.2.9.4	By the yoked one they attained all their desires.
9.4.2.10.6	They yoke him with those very (animals).
9.4.2.10.7	The yoke is below, below.
9.4.2.10.8	For the yoke is below, suitable for yoking.
9.4.2.10.9	With the hands.
9.4.2.10.10	For the hands are suitable for yoking
9.4.2.10.11	With the feet.
9.4.2.10.12	For the feet are suitable for yokeing.
9.4.2.11.1	He yokes the right-hand pair first, then the left-hand pair, then the right-hand draught-animal.
9.4.2.11.2	Thus in the case of the gods.
9.4.2.11.3	Otherwise in the case of men.
9.4.2.11.4	One should not yoke it; lest one should yoke the yoked.
9.4.2.11.5	But one should give a vehicle, saying, "Let us yoke with the yoked."
9.4.2.11.6	They carry it up, from the Adhvaryu's dwelling.
9.4.2.11.7	For he is above.
9.4.2.11.8	He gives it to the Adhvaryu.
9.4.2.11.9	For he makes it with that.
9.4.2.11.10	But he should direct it at the time of the Dakṣiṇās.
9.4.2.12.1	Then he offers the Rungmatī oblations.
9.4.2.12.2	Here this entire Agni is consecrated.
9.4.2.12.3	He desired lustre here.
9.4.2.12.4	The gods placed lustre in him with these Rungmatī (oblations).
9.4.2.12.5	and in the same way he places this in him.
9.4.2.13.1	And as to why he offers the Rungmatī oblations,
9.4.2.13.2	the Rung emerged from the scattered Prajapati.
9.4.2.13.3	The gods restored him to his original state and placed the Rung in him with these Rungmatī (oblations).
9.4.2.13.4	And in the same way this one places this in him.
9.4.2.14.1-5	The rays of thee, O Agni, are in the sun, the rays of you gods are in the sun. Bestow radiance on us, on the Brahmanas. The rays of thee are in the sun; the rays of you are in the sun." The rays are immortality. He bestows immortality on him. He offers three oblations. Agni is threefold.
9.4.2.14.6	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, with that much he places the lustre in him.
9.4.2.15.1	Then he offers to Varuna.
9.4.2.15.2	Here this entire Agni is consecrated.
9.4.2.15.3	This is Varuna, the deity here.
9.4.2.15.4	Therefore he offers this oblation to him.
9.4.2.15.5	He makes him a deity with the oblation.
9.4.2.15.6	The deity to whom the oblation is offered, that deity is not the one to whom it is not offered.
9.4.2.15.7	With a verse addressed to Varuna.
9.4.2.15.8	He thus pleases him with his own self and his own deity.
9.4.2.16.1	The reason why he offers to Varuna is that
9.4.2.16.2	the power of Prajapati had oozed out.
9.4.2.16.3	Where the gods united him, they placed his power in him.
9.4.2.16.4	In the same way he places it in him.
9.4.2.16.5	With a verse addressed to Varuna.
9.4.2.16.6	Varuna is indeed the nobility.
9.4.2.16.7	Nobility is indeed power.
9.4.2.16.8	He places power in him by means of power.
9.4.2.17.1	"I come to you with the Brahman, bowing."
9.4.2.17.2	"I beg you by the Brahman, bowing down." This is what it means.
9.4.2.17.3	"The sacrificer seeks it with oblations." This is what is meant.
9.4.2.17.4	"This sacrificer seeks it by means of oblations." This means.
9.4.2.17.5	"Be not angry with us, O Varuna, here."
9.4.2.17.6	"Do not be angry with us, here, O Varuna." This is what this means.
9.4.2.17.7	"O Varuna, do not deprive us of our long life."
9.4.2.17.8	He declares the gift to himself.
9.4.2.18.1	Then he offers the oblations of the Arkas and Asvamedha.
9.4.2.18.2	This Agni is Arkas.
9.4.2.18.3	That Aditya is Asvamedha
9.4.2.18.4	They were not created separately.
9.4.2.18.5	The gods united them with these oblations, they made them one.
9.4.2.18.6	In the same way, he nourishes and unites them with these oblations.
9.4.2.19.1	"Svāhā to the golden Gharmā!"
9.4.2.19.2	The sun is the Gharmā.
9.4.2.19.3	He establishes that sun in this fire.
9.4.2.20.1	"Svāhākāra to the golden Arka!"
9.4.2.20.2	This Agni is the Arka. This (Agni) is the Arka.
9.4.2.23.3	He places this Aditya as the highest of all.
9.4.2.23.4	Therefore, he is the highest of all this.
9.4.2.24.1	He offers five oblations.
9.4.2.24.2	Agni has five layers.
9.4.2.24.3	The year has five seasons.
9.4.2.24.4	Agni is the year.
9.4.2.24.5	As much as Agni is, as much as are his measures, by so much he makes him grow, he joins him.
9.4.2.25.1	"What indeed is the heaven, O Agni, svāhā!"
9.4.2.25.2	"Heaven, O Sun, svāhā!"
9.4.2.25.3	These are indeed the names of this Agni.
9.4.2.25.4	He pleases them.
9.4.2.25.5	He makes the deity with oblation.
9.4.2.25.6	The deity to whom the oblation is offered, that deity is not the one to whom it is not offered.
9.4.2.25.7	And indeed he places these Agni-s in this Agni by name.
9.4.2.26.1	He offers five oblations.
9.4.2.26.2	Agni has five layers.
9.4.2.26.3	The year has five seasons.
9.4.2.26.4	The year is Agni.
9.4.2.26.5	Whatever is the extent of Agni, whatever is his measure, by so much he thus gratifies him with food.
9.4.2.27.1	Now, indeed, about the pouring of oblations.
9.4.2.27.2	One should offer at this time whatever oblation one knows to be connected with a Brahman.
9.4.2.27.3	One yokes this chariot for the sake of desires.
9.4.2.27.4	Whatever oblation he offers here, he offers it as a true one.
9.4.2.28.1	They say, "One should not offer, lest one should exceed."
9.4.2.28.2	He should offer, indeed.
9.4.2.28.3	These oblations are offered for the sake of desires.
9.4.2.28.4	There is no excess of desires.
9.4.3.1.1	Having returned, at the time of the Dhishnya oblations, he offers the Dhishnya offerings.
9.4.3.1.2	These are the fires, for they are the Hotras.
9.4.3.1.3	He thus builds the fires.
9.4.3.1.4	These are the classes.
9.4.3.1.5	This Agni is built as the nobility.
9.4.3.1.6	He thus makes it both nobility and class.
9.4.3.1.7	He builds the eastern one first, then these ones.
9.4.3.1.8	Having made it nobility, he makes it class.
9.4.3.2.1	It is one.
9.4.3.2.2	He thus establishes the nobility in one place, and the prosperity in one place.
9.4.3.2.3	many others.
9.4.3.2.4	He places the height of that (fire-altar) (in the form of) a pyramid.
9.4.3.3.1	It has five layers.
9.4.3.3.2	The others have one layer.
9.4.3.3.3	He places (the fire-altar) of the Kṣatriya above (that of the Brāhmaṇa) by means of energy.
9.4.3.3.4	He makes the Kṣatriyas more energetic than the Viśs.
9.4.3.3.5	He builds it upwards.
9.4.3.3.6	He builds the Kṣatriyās above (the fire-altars of) the other castes, and the others below.
9.4.3.3.7	He places it below the Kṣatra, the people.
9.4.3.4.1	He builds it with both the Yajus and the Lokamprinā. He builds it with the Lokamprinã alone.
9.4.3.4.2	He thus places the Kṣatra above the people.
9.4.3.4.3	The Kṣatra becomes more powerful than the people.
9.4.3.4.4	And the people become less powerful than the Kṣatra.
9.4.3.5.1	When he builds them with the Lokamprinas, he makes the Lokamprinās the Kshatra. The Lokamprinās are the Kshatra; he makes the Kshatra the eater of the Vish.
9.4.3.5.2	He builds both the Adhvara and Agni.
9.4.3.5.3	The Adhvara first, then Agni.
9.4.3.5.4	Its relation has been explained.
9.4.3.5.5	He builds the Adhvara in the place where he lays down the Adhvara-bricks.
9.4.3.5.6	He first lays down the Agni-dhriya brick.
9.4.3.5.7	He first pours down (the Agni-dhriya bricks) while sitting facing the south, facing the north.
9.4.3.5.8	Its relation has been stated.
9.4.3.6.1	In it he lays down eight bricks.
9.4.3.6.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
9.4.3.6.3	Agni is Gayatri.
9.4.3.6.4	He thus builds him up to the extent of Agni's size.
9.4.3.6.5	Of them the stone is the ninth.
9.4.3.6.6	There are nine vital airs.
9.4.3.6.7	Seven in the head.
9.4.3.6.8	Two downward.
9.4.3.6.9	He places them in him.
9.4.3.6.10	The fire which is placed in the fire-pan is the tenth.
9.4.3.6.11	There are ten vital airs.
9.4.3.6.12	The Agnidhra is in the middle.
9.4.3.6.13	He places the vital airs in the middle.
9.4.3.6.14	In the middle, indeed, the vital airs are present, and they move in and out of the self.
9.4.3.7.1	He places twenty-one Hotrīya bricks.
9.4.3.7.2	Twenty-one is the number of the Parishrita.
9.4.3.7.3	Its relation has been explained.
9.4.3.7.4	Eleven are the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsa.
9.4.3.7.5	The Tristubh metre has eleven syllables.
9.4.3.7.6	Indra is connected with the Tristubh.
9.4.3.7.7	The Brāhmaṇacchaṃsin is connected with Indra.
9.4.3.7.8	Eight in the others.
9.4.3.7.9	His relation is stated.
9.4.3.8.1	Six in the Marjalis.
9.4.3.8.2	Six are the seasons, the fathers.
9.4.3.8.3	The seasons, the fathers, surrounded him on the right.
9.4.3.8.4	He is on their right.
9.4.3.8.5	He places him thus: "This is him."
9.4.3.8.6	Thus he makes the clan face the nobility.
9.4.3.9.1	Then he surrounds them with the Parisrita (bricks).
9.4.3.9.2	The Parisrita (brick) is indeed water.
9.4.3.9.3	He thus surrounds them with water.
9.4.3.9.4	He places them around.
9.4.3.9.5	The Khata-carrying ones are indeed the Kshatriya class of waters.
9.4.3.9.6	And these are the Vis (commoners) which are the waters in the holes.
9.4.3.9.7	When he places the (bricks) in the pit, he places the Kṣatra (class) in the Kṣatra; he places the Kşatra in the Kṣatras.
9.4.3.9.8	When he places them around, he places the Viś (class) in Viś; he places the Viš in the Viś.
9.4.3.9.9	The number of bricks is equal to the number of mantras.
9.4.3.9.10	As many as are the Yajus-verses in this (rite), so many are the Parishrita-offerings.
9.4.3.9.11	He thus makes the people follow the king and his ways.
9.4.3.10.1	Then he scatters the soil on them.
9.4.3.10.2	Its relation has been explained.
9.4.3.10.3	Silently.
9.4.3.10.4	For the soil is not mentioned.
9.4.3.10.5	Then he offers the Pasupurodāsa of the Agniṣṭoma animal in the direction of the Dīśāṃ-aveṣṭi oblations.
9.4.3.10.6	This Agni is in the directions.
9.4.3.10.7	He offers these oblations to them.
9.4.3.10.8	He makes that deity with the oblation.
9.4.3.10.9	That deity to whom the oblation is offered, that deity is not that deity to whom it is not offered.
9.4.3.10.10	There are five.
9.4.3.10.11	There are five directions.
9.4.3.11.1	They say, "One should offer this Iṣṭi with ten oblations."
9.4.3.11.2	It is all-Stoma, all-Prstha.
9.4.3.11.3	All the metres, all the directions, all the seasons, all this Agni is.
9.4.3.11.4	He makes him a deity with oblations.
9.4.3.11.5	The deity to whom the oblation is offered, that deity is not the one to whom it is not offered.
9.4.3.11.6	There are ten.
9.4.3.11.7	The Viraj has ten syllables.
9.4.3.11.8	Viraj is Agni.
9.4.3.11.9	There are the ten directions.
9.4.3.11.10	The directions are Agni.
9.4.3.11.11	There ate the ten vital airs.
9.4.3.11.12	The vital airs are Agni.
9.4.3.11.13	Whatever is the extent of Agni, whatever is his measure, by so much he pleases him with food.
9.4.3.12.1	One should offer these oblations to the gods themselves.
9.4.3.12.2	These are the deities who are gratified by this libation, by which one is about to perform this sacrifice.
9.4.3.12.3	He pleases them.
9.4.3.12.4	They, being pleased and gratified, consent to this sacrifice.
9.4.3.12.5	They are the ones who consent to his consecration.
9.4.3.12.6	He who the kings consent to as their king, he is the king, not he whom they do not consent to.
9.4.3.12.7	Because these deities are consecrated with this consecration, and because these deities consecrate him with this consecration, therefore it is the property of the gods.
9.4.3.13.1	They have two names.
9.4.3.13.2	The son of a man who performs the Savana rite becomes one with two names.
9.4.3.13.3	The Savana rite for which one performs, and the Savana rite by which one performs, these are his two names.
9.4.3.14.1	There are eight (Savana rites).
9.4.3.14.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
9.4.3.14.3	Agni is Gayatri.
9.4.3.14.4	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, by so much he pleases him with food.
9.4.3.15.1	They say, "One should not offer these oblations, lest they should exceed."
9.4.3.15.2	But one should offer them.
9.4.3.15.3	These oblations are offered for the sake of desires, and there is nothing beyond desires.
9.4.3.15.4	Whatever oblation is offered after the Pasupurodāsa, the oblation is placed in the middle of the animal.
9.4.3.15.5	He offers two oblations, of the sacrifice and of Agni.
9.4.3.15.6	First of the sacrifice, then of Agni.
9.4.3.15.7	Its relation is stated.
9.4.3.15.8	The Pasupurodāsa is high.
9.4.3.15.9	These are low.
9.4.3.15.10	Because it is an Iṣṭi.
9.4.3.15.11	He says, "Recite, O Pratiprasthātṛ," at the Pasupurodās.
9.4.3.15.12	He says "Recite, offer," at these.
9.4.3.15.13	Because it (the Pasupurodása) is an Iṣți.
9.4.3.15.14	The Svishtakrit is equal.
9.4.3.15.15	The Nidā is equal.
9.4.3.15.16	Deities are equal.
9.4.3.15.17	The Svishtakrit does not participate.
9.4.3.16.1	Then he touches him with the eastern consecration: "Savitar, the bestower of wealth, has made you the king of the wealthy."
9.4.3.16.2	"This is your king."
9.4.3.16.3	"Soma is our king of the Brahmanas."
9.4.3.16.4	He indeed rescues the Brahmanas and makes them unfit to eat.
9.4.4.1.1	Then, when he is about to begin the morning recitation, he yokes the fire, saying, "With the yoked one I partake."
9.4.4.1.2	With that yoked one he partakes of all desires.
9.4.4.1.3	He yokes it before all the rites. Whatever is done above it, all that is accomplished in the yoked one.
9.4.4.2.1	He yoked it on the enclosing sticks.
9.4.4.2.2	The enclosing sticks are the fires.
9.4.4.2.3	He thus yokes Agni with the fires.
9.4.4.3.1	Having touched the middle enclosing stick, he mutters this formula: "I yoke Agni with strength and ghee."
9.4.4.3.2	Strength is power.
9.4.4.3.3	"I yoke Agni with power and ghee."
9.4.4.3.4	"This divine bird is great in age."
9.4.4.3.5	This is the divine Suparna, the great hawk, in the smoke.
9.4.4.3.6	By that we may go to the highest heaven, ascending to the highest heaven of the expanse of the sky.
9.4.4.3.7	The world of heaven is the Naaka.
9.4.4.3.8	By that may we go to the highest world of heaven, ascending to heaven. This is the meaning.
9.4.4.4.1	Then (the Adhvaryu) says, "These are thy two wings, firm and feathered, by which thou, O Agni, dost drive away the Rakshas. By them may we go to the world of the good, where the Rishis, the first-born, the ancient ones have gone."
9.4.4.4.2	He thus addresses those Rishis.
9.4.4.5.1	Then (the Adhvaryu) says, "The Moon, the hawk, the truthful, the golden-winged, the bird, the swift."
9.4.4.5.2	Gold is nectar.
9.4.4.5.3	This means, "The bird of the nectar side belongs to the lord."
9.4.4.5.4	"Firmly seated in the great abode,
9.4.4.5.5	I bow to you.
9.4.4.5.6	Do not harm me."
9.4.4.5.7	He speaks of the protection of the self.
9.4.4.6.1	The middle verse is the self.
9.4.4.6.2	And those on either side are the two wings.
9.4.4.6.3	Therefore they have wings.
9.4.4.6.4	The two wings are indeed those.
9.4.4.7.1	He yokes with three (verses).
9.4.4.7.2	Agni is threefold.
9.4.4.7.3	He yoked him with as much as Agni is, as much as is his measure.
9.4.4.8.1	Then he offers the king after pressing on the fire.
9.4.4.8.2	This indeed is that very pressing. He presses that which they allow him, the deities with whom he presses, being allowed.
9.4.4.8.3	The king to whom the other kings give their consent, he becomes the king, not he to whom they do not give their consent.
9.4.4.8.4	What he offers in the fire, that he consecrates with the fire.
9.4.4.8.5	This is his divine self, consecrated with Soma, consecrated with immortality.
9.4.4.8.6	Then he eats.
9.4.4.8.7	He consecrates himself.
9.4.4.8.8	This is his soul, anointed with Soma, anointed with immortality.
9.4.4.9.1	Having offered into the fire, he then eats.
9.4.4.9.2	This is his divine soul.
9.4.4.9.3	This is the human soul.
9.4.4.9.4	The gods came first, then the humans.
9.4.4.9.5	Therefore, having offered into the fire he then eats.
9.4.4.10.1	Then he releases him, having obtained him, for the purpose for which he yokes him, the Yajñāyajñiya.
9.4.4.10.2	One who is about to perform the Stotra.
9.4.4.10.3	The Yajñāyuja is indeed the heavenly world.
9.4.4.10.4	He yokes him by means of this (Yajñāyujya).
9.4.4.10.5	Having obtained him, for that purpose for which he has yoked him,
9.4.4.11.1	He releases him before the Stotra.
9.4.4.11.2	If he were to release it after the hymn, he would go beyond heaven and be lost.
9.4.4.11.3	But when he releases it before the hymn, he attains heaven and releases it.
9.4.4.12.1	He releases it on the boundary lines.
9.4.4.12.2	For he yokes him on the boundary lines
9.4.4.12.3	Wherever they yoke a suitable animal, there they release it.
9.4.4.13.1	Having touched the two twilight-prayers, he recites the two Yajus-verses. The two Yajus verses flow along the three enclosing sticks. "The head of heaven, the navel of earth." On the right (he recites), "Thou standest on the head of the universe, thou art established." On the left (he recites).
9.4.4.13.2	With the verses containing the word "mūrdha" (head).
9.4.4.13.3	Because this is the head of heaven.
9.4.4.13.4	The Yajus-verses beginning with "O Agni, the all-consuming" are the praise of Agni.
9.4.4.13.5	Water is peace.
9.4.4.13.6	Therefore, the verses beginning with "O water" are recited.
9.4.4.14.1	One releases (Agni) with two verses.
9.4.4.14.2	The sacrificer has two feet.
9.4.4.14.3	The sacrificers are Agni.
9.4.4.14.4	With as much as Agni is and as much as is his measure, he thus releases him.
9.4.4.14.5	He yokes with three.
9.4.4.14.6	That is five.
9.4.4.14.7	The fire has five layers.
9.4.4.14.8	The year has five seasons.
9.4.4.14.9	The year is Agni.
9.4.4.14.10	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, so much it becomes.
9.4.4.15.1	Some indeed yoke it at the Prāyaniya Atiratra and release it at the Udayaniya.
9.4.4.15.2	The form of the sacrifice is indeed the release.
9.4.4.15.3	One should not do so, thinking, "I will perform the form of the sacrifice before the actual sacrifice."
9.4.4.15.4	One should not act like that.
9.4.4.15.5	The sacrifice is performed and completed every day.
9.4.4.15.6	Every day it connects him to the path to the world of heaven.
9.4.4.15.7	Every day he goes to the world of Svarga through it.
9.4.4.15.8	Therefore one should yoke and unyoke every day.
9.4.4.16.1	And just as in the Prāyaniya Atiratra, having recited the Sāmidhenī verses, one would say, "I am the reciter of the Udayaniya," so it is.
9.4.4.16.2	Therefore one should yoke and release every day.
9.4.4.17.1	Now, Śāṇḍilya, having taught the daily rites to the Kankatīyas, went forth, saying, "You should yoke yourselves daily and unyoke yourselves daily."
9.4.4.17.2	Therefore one should yoke oneself daily and unyoike oneself daily.
9.5.1.1.1	Now, then, about the vow of drinking milk.
9.5.1.1.2	One should be initiated with the vow of drinking only milk.
9.5.1.1.3	Indeed, the nectar had escaped from the gods.
9.5.1.2.1	They said, "We will seek it by means of penance and exertion."
9.5.1.2.2	They sought it by means of exertion and penance.
9.5.1.2.3	Having initiated themselves, they became on a milk diet.
9.5.1.2.4	This indeed is penance, that one becomes on a milk diet after initiation.
9.5.1.2.5	They heard the sound of it quickly.
9.5.1.3.1	They said, "One who has become initiated becomes more and more."
9.5.1.3.2	"Let us undertake more penance."
9.5.1.3.3	They went to the three breasts.
9.5.1.3.4	They saw them from a distance.
9.5.1.4.1	They said, "This one is nearer."
9.5.1.4.2	"Let us go to more penance," (they said).
9.5.1.4.3	They went to the two breasts.
9.5.1.4.4	They did not see them from a distance now.
9.5.1.5.1	They said "This one is closer."
9.5.1.5.2	"Let's go to more penance."
9.5.1.5.3	They went to one breast.
9.5.1.5.4	They reached it.
9.5.1.5.5	But they were not able to reach it.
9.5.1.6.1	They said, "It has gone up.
9.5.1.6.2	But we are not able to reach.
9.5.1.6.3	Let us all practise austerity."
9.5.1.6.4	They practised fasting on the Upavasatha day.
9.5.1.6.5	For this is the whole of austerity, that one fasts.
9.5.1.6.6	Therefore one should not eat on the Upavsatha day.
9.5.1.7.1	Then, having taken it in the morning, they offered it to Agni.
9.5.1.7.2	They placed immortality in Agni.
9.5.1.7.3	Agni is indeed the Self of all the gods.
9.5.1.7.4	When they placed immortality in Agni, they placed immortality in the Self.
9.5.1.7.5	Then the gods became immortal.
9.5.1.8.1	That which is that immortal Soma, that is he.
9.5.1.8.2	Even today the sacrificer seeks it with effort and austerity.
9.5.1.8.3	Having been initiated, he becomes a milk-eater.
9.5.1.8.4	This indeed is austerity, that having been initiated, one becomes a milk-eate.
9.5.1.8.5	He hears its sound, saying, "It is the price."
9.5.1.9.1	He approaches three udders.
9.5.1.9.2	He sees it there.
9.5.1.9.3	He approaches two breasts.
9.5.1.9.4	He sees the other one from a distance.
9.5.1.9.5	He approaches one breast.
9.5.1.9.6	He attains it.
9.5.1.9.7	But he is unable to reach it.
9.5.1.9.8	He approaches the fast-day without eating.
9.5.1.9.9	This is all austerity, namely, fasting.
9.5.1.9.10	Therefore, one should not eat on the fast-day.
9.5.1.10.1	He offers it in the fire in the morning, after having taken it.
9.5.1.10.2	He places immortality in the fire.
9.5.1.10.3	Then he eats it.
9.5.1.10.4	He puts immortality in himself.
9.5.1.10.5	He becomes immortal.
9.5.1.10.6	This is the immortality of man, that he goes through the whole of his life.
9.5.1.10.7	Thus indeed, by this self, he goes through the entire life.
9.5.1.11.1	Having offered in the fire, he then eats.
9.5.1.11.2	This is his divine self.
9.5.1.11.3	This is his human self.
9.5.1.11.4	Gods came first, then men.
9.5.1.11.5	Therefore, having offered in the fire, one eats.
9.5.1.12.1	Now, here is the discussion about the Samitsya-yajus.
9.5.1.12.2	The gods and the demons, both of them being the sons of Prajapati, approached the inheritance of their father. They approached speech, which is both true and false, both truth and falsehood.
9.5.1.12.3	They both spoke the truth and both spoke falsehood.
9.5.1.12.4	Those who spoke alike became alike.
9.5.1.13.1	The gods, having abandoned falsehood, adhered to truth.
9.5.1.13.2	The Asuras, having abandoned truth, adhered to falsehood.
9.5.1.14.1	Then indeed he saw that truth, when he was among the Asuras. The gods, having abandoned falsehood, approached truth.
9.5.1.14.2	"Let us go there."
9.5.1.14.3	He went to the gods.
9.5.1.15.1	He saw falsehood, when he was with the gods. The Asuras, having abandoned truth, approached falsehood. "Let us go there."
9.5.1.15.2	He went to Asuras.
9.5.1.16.1	All the gods spoke the truth, all the Asuras spoke falsehood.
9.5.1.16.2	The gods who spoke the truth became more powerful, the Asuras who spoke falsehood became less powerful.
9.5.1.16.3	Therefore, he who speaks the truth becomes more powerful, he who speaks falsehood becomes less powerful.
9.5.1.16.4	He becomes the last.
9.5.1.16.5	The gods became the last.
9.5.1.17.1	Then the Asuras, having been defeated, spoke untruth. They became like the Usha plant, like the Aushas plant.
9.5.1.17.2	Therefore, he who speaks untruth when defeated, becomes like the Usha, like the Ausha plant.
9.5.1.17.3	But he who speaks untruths at the end becomes defeated.
9.5.1.17.4	For the Asuras were defeated.
9.5.1.18.1	And that truth is the threefold knowledge.
9.5.1.18.2	The gods said, "Having performed the sacrifice, we shall accomplish this truth."
9.5.1.19.1	They offered the consecration oblation.
9.5.1.19.2	The Asuras then understood that the gods, having performed the sacrifice, were accomplishing truth.
9.5.1.19.3	"We shall take away whatever belongs to us there."
9.5.1.19.4	The Samit-yajus was not offered.
9.5.1.19.5	Then they went.
9.5.1.19.6	Therefore they do not offer the Samitsya-yajus of that sacrifice.
9.5.1.19.7	The gods, having seen the Asuras, and having abandoned the sacrifice, began to perform another.
9.5.1.19.8	They said, "They are performing another." They went away again.
9.5.1.20.1	When they had gone away, they offered the Prayaniya (oblation).
9.5.1.20.2	The Asuras indeed knew that.
9.5.1.20.3	The peace of that (sacrifice) has been declared.
9.5.1.20.4	Then they went.
9.5.1.20.5	Therefore that sacrifice is peaceful.
9.5.1.20.6	The gods, having seen the Asuras, and having forgotten the sacrifice, decided to do something else.
9.5.1.20.7	"They said, "They are doing something else," and went back."
9.5.1.21.1	When they had gone back, having bought a king, and having made him go away, they offered a sacrificial oblation to him as a guest.
9.5.1.21.2	The Asuras, however, soon found out about it.
9.5.1.21.3	The Iḍā is invoked.
9.5.1.21.4	Then they went away.
9.5.1.21.5	Therefore that sacrifice is concluded with the Iḍā.
9.5.1.21.6	The gods, having seen the Asuras, and having concealed the sacrifice, began to perform another one.
9.5.1.21.7	"They said, 'They are performing another one.' They went back again."
9.5.1.22.1	When they had gone back, the Apasads were woven.
9.5.1.22.2	They, having recited the three Samidheni verses, offered to the deities alone and not to the Prayāja and Anuyāja offerings. They placed the offerings on both sides of the sacrifice.
9.5.1.22.3	For they were in a hurry there.
9.5.1.22.4	Therefore, at the Upasads, having recited the Samidheni verse three times, he offers to the deities alone, not to the Prayājas and Anuyājas, and places the offerings on both the sides of the sacrifice.
9.5.1.23.1	They offered the animal to Agni-Soma on the Upavasatha day.
9.5.1.23.2	The Asuras came to know of it.
9.5.1.23.3	They did not offer the Samits and Yajus.
9.5.1.23.4	Then they went away.
9.5.1.23.5	Therefore, they do not offer the Samit and Yajus of that animal.
9.5.1.23.6	The gods, seeing the Asuras, decided to perform a different sacrifice.
9.5.1.23.7	"They said, "We will perform a different one." They went back."
9.5.1.24.1	When they had gone, they performed the morning Soma-pressing.
9.5.1.24.2	The Asuras indeed knew that.
9.5.1.24.3	They had done as much as the morning Soma- pressing.
9.5.1.24.4	Then they went.
9.5.1.25.5	The gods, seeing the Asuras, decided to perform a different sacrifice.
9.5.1.25.6	They went back again, saying, "They are performing a different sacrifice."
9.5.1.26.1	When they had gone, they performed the Savaniya animal sacrifice.
9.5.1.26.2	The Asuras found out about it.
9.5.1.26.3	They did as much as was done for that animal.
9.5.1.26.4	Then they went.
9.5.1.26.5	The gods, seeing the Asuras, having destroyed the sacrifice, began to perform another sacrifice.
9.5.1.26.6	They said, "We shall perform another sacrifice." They went again.
9.5.1.27.1	When they had gone, they performed the third pressing.
9.5.1.27.2	They established it.
9.5.1.27.3	Whatever they established, they attained all that as truth.
9.5.1.27.4	Then the Asuras became angry.
9.5.1.27.5	Then the gods became victorious, the Asuras defeated.
9.5.1.27.6	He who knows this becomes victorious over his enemies, his foes become his brothers.
9.5.1.28.1	The gods said, "Those who have not come to these sacrifices, which are based on material things, let us know how we can establish them."
9.5.1.28.2	They said, "Let us reflect."
9.5.1.28.3	They said, "We desire to know."
9.5.1.28.4	"We desire to know how to establish these sacrifices."
9.5.1.29.1	While they were deliberating, they saw these Samishtayajus (verses).
9.5.1.29.2	They offered them.
9.5.1.29.3	By them they established these sacrifices.
9.5.1.29.4	Because they established them, they are called Samishtayajuses.
9.5.1.29.5	Now, because they are connected with the Samidhs, therefore the Samitsya-yajus-offerings.
9.5.1.30.1	These indeed are the nine sacrifices.
9.5.1.30.2	These are the nine Samitsya-Yajus-offer ings.
9.5.1.30.3	When he offers these, he thus establishes these sacrifices.
9.5.1.30.4	He offers both (kinds of) offerings, first those of the Adhvara and then those of Agni.
9.5.1.30.5	The significance of this has been explained.
9.5.1.31.1	Two oblations are offered to Agni.
9.5.1.31.2	The sacrificer has two feet.
9.5.1.31.3	The sacrificers are Agni.
9.5.1.31.4	He thus establishes the sacrifice as much as Agni is and as much as is his measure.
9.5.1.31.5	The sacrifice is well-offered by the Bhrigus.
9.5.1.31.6	May Agni, well-offered, protect us.
9.5.1.32.1	These (oblations) become eleven in both ways.
9.5.1.33.5	Now, that which is the Self of the sacrifice, that is the deity; in that very (deity) he establishes the sacrifice at the end.
9.5.1.34.1	Having offered the Samitsya-formulas, they proceed to the Avabhrtha bath.
9.5.1.34.2	Having risen from the Avabhrth bath, having performed the Udayaniya rite, he offers the Pasupurodasa of the Anubandhya animal and the oblations of the Devakas.
9.5.1.35.1	Prajapati, having attained this, became satisfied.
9.5.1.35.2	Having established himself in the directions, he established and arranged everything.
9.5.1.35.3	Because he established and arranged, therefore he is called Dhātā.
9.5.1.35.4	In the same way, the sacrificer, having established himself in the quarters, establishes and arranges everything.
9.5.1.36.1	Why he offers these oblations,
9.5.1.36.2	This Agni is in the directions.
9.5.1.36.3	Those very ones are in front, the darbha-stalks and the bricks for the Locana.
9.5.1.36.4	They are the breath-bearers in the first layer.
9.5.1.36.5	All in the second.
9.5.1.36.6	All in third.
9.5.1.36.7	All in fourth.
9.5.1.36.8	Then for the fifth layer, the enemies of enemies, the Nakṣatras, the five-crested ones.
9.5.1.36.9	They go upward, they go out.
9.5.1.36.10	Prajapati was afraid of them: "All this will go beyond them."
9.5.1.36.11	Having become Dhatr, he went around them.
9.5.1.36.12	He stood in them.
9.5.1.37.1	He who is Dhatr, that is the sun.
9.5.1.37.2	Now that which is the highest point of the directions, that is this, in which this shines.
9.5.1.38.1	He who is the creator, he is the same as the creator. The cake on twelve potsherds.
9.5.1.38.2	On twelve potsherds
9.5.1.38.3	Twelve months are a year.
9.5.1.38.4	The year is Prajapati.
9.5.1.38.5	Prajapati is the creator.
9.5.1.38.6	Now that which is the supreme limit of the directions, these are the first oblations: a cake to Anumati, a cake to Raka, a cake to Sinivali, a cake to Kuhvi.
9.5.1.38.7	In that he offers these, he establishes him in that which is the highest limit of the directions.
9.5.1.38.8	He offers them all.
9.5.1.40.1	They say, "One should not offer these oblations, lest they should exceed."
9.5.1.40.2	But one should offer them.
9.5.1.40.3	These oblations are offered for the sake of desires.
9.5.1.40.4	There is nothing beyond desires.
9.5.1.40.5	Whatever oblation is offered after the Pasupurodāsa, the oblation is placed in the middle of the animal.
9.5.1.40.6	He offers two oblations, of the sacrifice and of Agni.
9.5.1.40.7	The oblation of the sacrifice is offered first.
9.5.1.40.8	Then that of Agni.
9.5.1.40.9	Its relation has been stated.
9.5.1.40.10	The Pasupurodāsa oblation is offered loudly.
9.5.1.40.11	These are offered silently.
9.5.1.40.12	Because it is an Iṣṭi.
9.5.1.40.13	He says, "Recite, O Pratiprasthātṛ," at the Pasupurodāsā oblation.
9.5.1.40.14	He says "Recite, offer" at these.
9.5.1.40.15	Because it (the Pasupurodása) is an Iṣți.
9.5.1.40.16	The Svishtakrit is the same.
9.5.1.40.17	The Nidā is the same. The Nidā is the name of a rite.
9.5.1.41.1	They offer the Samitsya verses to this animal.
9.5.1.41.2	They sprinkle it with the Hridayashula.
9.5.1.41.3	Because this animal is established.
9.5.1.41.4	Having gone around with the Hridaya-shula,
9.5.1.42.1	he returns and offers the Vaishvakarman offerings.
9.5.1.42.2	This Agni is in all actions.
9.5.1.42.3	All these rites are performed for him.
9.5.1.42.4	He pleases them.
9.5.1.42.5	He makes the deity with oblation.
9.5.1.42.6	The deity for whom the oblation is taken, that deity is pleased, not the one for whom it is not taken.
9.5.1.42.7	And this Agni is the creator of all.
9.5.1.42.8	He pleases him.
9.5.1.43.1	When one offers to Vaisvānara, 
9.5.1.43.2-5	The Savitrī verses are for the final departure and the Vaiśva-karman verses are for the return. The Savitrī verses constitute the final departure and Vaiśva-karma verses constitute the return. If one were to offer only the Savitrī verses and not the Vaiśva -karma verses, it would be as if one were to make only the final departure and not the return.
9.5.1.43.6	Now if one were to offer only to Vaiśvānara and not to Savitr, one would be doing only the act of going up and not the act of going down.
9.5.1.43.7	One offers to both.
9.5.1.43.8	One does the act of going both up and down.
9.5.1.44.1	There are eight oblations.
9.5.1.44.2	So here.
9.5.1.44.3	One does both the act of going and the act of going upward as in the case of the act of going.
9.5.1.44.4	The ninth is the form of Svāhā.
9.5.1.44.5	Thus he makes their departure and return in this way.
9.5.1.44.6	The tenth is the offering.
9.5.1.44.7	Thus he causes their departure and return to be in this way. 
9.5.1.44.8	He offers a continuous oblation there, for the sacrifice is semen there, for the uninterruptedness of semen.
9.5.1.44.9	With the ladle, here, with the word "svāhā".
9.5.1.44.10	For semen is indeed called "nirukta" (i.e., named).
9.5.1.45.1	Whatever is born from the mind, from the heart, from the eye, from that all this first action originated. After that, the dead one goes to the world of the righteous.
9.5.1.45.2	Where the sages went, the first-born, the ancient ones.
9.5.1.45.3	The Rsis say this to him:
9.5.1.46.1	"This is the place of sacrifice, I give it to you."
9.5.1.46.2	The place of sacrifice is heaven.
9.5.1.46.3	He gives it to him for heaven.
9.5.1.46.4	"O Jātavedas, you who bring the sacrificial oblation,
9.5.1.46.5	May the lord of sacrifice follow you here."
9.5.1.46.6	"We know him in the highest heaven."
9.5.1.46.7	The bond is as the Yajus.
9.5.1.47.1	Know this, O ye Gods, in the highest heaven, the form of this (Agni).
9.5.1.47.2	"Come ye by the paths of the Gods, ye have performed the desired and the undesired for us."
9.5.1.47.3	The relation is as the Yajus.
9.5.1.47.4	"Awake, O Agni,
9.5.1.47.5	By whom thou carriest."
9.5.1.47.6	The relation of these two has been stated.
9.5.1.48.1	With the sacrificial grass, the enclosing sticks, the ladle, the altar and the sacrificial grass, do thou, O Riki, lead this sacrifice to heaven among the gods.
9.5.1.48.2	"We are going."
9.5.1.48.3	"With these forms of our sacrifice, do thou lead us to heaven."
9.5.1.49.1	"Whatever has been given, whatever has been given away, whatever has been fulfilled, and whatever are the fees, may Agni, the all-worker, bestow them in heaven among the gods."
9.5.1.49.2	And whatever we give now and whatever we do not give now, may this Agni Vaiśvānara place us in the world of heaven. Thus it is said.
9.5.1.50.1	Where are the streams of honey and ghee that are not exhausted, may Agni Vaiśvânara place us in heaven among the gods. Thus it is.
9.5.1.50.2	The binding is as per the Yajus.
9.5.1.51.1	He offers eight oblations to Visvakarman.
9.5.1.51.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
9.5.1.51.3	Agni is Gayatri.
9.5.1.51.4	He thus pleases him with as much food as Agni is and as much as his measure is.
9.5.1.52.1	Having offered the oblations to Visvakarman, he gives a name.
9.5.1.52.2	When one is born completely, then they give a name.
9.5.1.52.3	Here, indeed, this entire created being is born.
9.5.1.53.1	Having given a name, he then stands near it.
9.5.1.53.2	He creates it with the entire self.
9.5.1.53.3	If he does not mention this gift of the self here, then indeed this (self) would injure his self here.
9.5.1.53.4	But when he mentions this gift of the Self here, then indeed it does not injure his Self.
9.5.1.53.5	Of all the fires that are in this earth, thou art the best.
9.5.1.53.6	"May we live, O Agni, for a long time."
9.5.1.53.7	Of all the fires that have five layers in this earth, you are the best.
9.5.1.53.8	May you lead us to life. This is in Anushtubh metre.
9.5.1.53.9	Speech is Anushtubh.
9.5.1.53.10	Speech is all the metres.
9.5.1.53.11	All of them together praise him with these verses.
9.5.1.53.12	Having approached the fire, having ascended it, having churned it, he offers the oblation at the end of the day.
9.5.1.54.1	Then he offers the Payasyā oblation to Mitra-Varuna.
9.5.1.54.2	One who performs this rite becomes divine.
9.5.1.54.3	Mitra-Varuna is the divine pair.
9.5.1.54.4	If he were to act like a human being without having performed this (sacrifice), it would be a fall.
9.5.1.54.5	Just as one who is divine becomes human, so would it be.
9.5.1.54.6	When he performs the Payasyā sacrifice with Maitrāvaruṇa, he approaches the divine pair.
9.5.1.54.7	Having performed this (sacrifice) one may act according to one's desire and as befits one.
9.5.1.55.1	When one performs the Payasyă sacrifice with Maitrāvaruna,
9.5.1.55.2	From the semen of Prajapati, which had been scattered, fell down.
9.5.1.55.3	The gods collected it there and deposited it in him with this Maitravaruni Payasya.
9.5.1.55.4	In the same way, he deposits it in him.
9.5.1.56.1	He who was Prajapati, who was scattered, is indeed this very one who is being built as Agni.
9.5.1.56.2	Now that semen which fell from him, that is this Payasyā (oblation) to Mitra-Varuna. For Mitra-Varuna are the out-breath and in-breath.
9.5.1.56.3	The out-breath and the in-breath indeed make the semen which has been deposited grow.
9.5.1.56.4	It is Payasyā (i.e. made of milk).
9.5.1.56.5	For milk is semen.
9.5.1.56.6	It is a sacrifice.
9.5.1.56.7	For a sacrifice is indeed the semen of a sacrifice.
9.5.1.56.8	It is performed in a low voice.
9.5.1.56.9	For semen is deposited in a low voice.
9.5.1.56.10	It is at the end.
9.5.1.56.11	For semen is deposited at the end. Here it is deposited.
9.5.1.57.1	They perform the Vājinī rite on it.
9.5.1.57.2	He places the Dakṣiṇā on it. One should give a pair of sheep, says Māhitthi.
9.5.1.57.3	One should know that it is by the Abhijānayanī rite, says Māhitthī.
9.5.1.57.4	The offering made to Agni is indeed flowing, the Soma offering is made to Agni when one offers on the Anīṣṭaka.
9.5.1.58.1	He should place the Svayamātr̥ṇā (bricks) himself.
9.5.1.58.2	These indeed are the Svayamātarīṇā bricks.
9.5.1.58.3	These are the worlds, this Agni is built.
9.5.1.59.1	One should place the Rtavīya (bricks).
9.5.1.59.2	The seasons are the Rtavīyas.
9.5.1.59.3	This Agni is built in the seasons.
9.5.1.60.1	One should put the Viśvajyotīṣa (bricks).
9.5.1.60.2	These are the deities of the Viśvajyotiṣa.
9.5.1.61.7	The fire that is deposited in the fire-pan, that very brick is the fire. All the fire is united with that.
9.5.1.61.8	When he offers in the fire, then it is as if all the oblations offered in the fire-pit of the Sāṇḍila are offered when it is piled up with wings and tail.
9.5.1.62.1	All the beings, all the gods are in the womb of him who carries the fire.
9.5.1.62.2	He who builds it for less than a year, he causes all these beings to be born in the womb of a being.
9.5.1.62.3	He who causes a human being to be born in a womb, that is indeed condemned. But what is this?
9.5.1.62.4	This is indeed a god.
9.5.1.62.5	Vatsa says, "One should not be a priest for one who has not kept the vow for a year."
9.5.1.62.6	"One should not be the priest for one who is being expelled from the sacrifice, which is the semen of the gods, and is being offered today."
9.5.1.63.1	They say, "One should choose the last one for six months."
9.5.1.63.2	"For the last one for the six months, the embryo is born alive."
9.5.1.63.3	If one were to chant a great hymn for one who has kept the vow for less than a year, one should chant the Rigashtī.
9.5.1.64.2	He said to him, "O son of Sandilā, how should Agni be conceived?"
9.5.1.64.3	"We are exhausted by carrying the fire for a year."
9.5.1.64.4	"We desire to conceive Agni."
9.5.1.65.1	He said, "One should indeed conceive it as one desires, by whom it has been carried for a year before.
9.5.1.65.2	For that very one, being carried, is conceived."
9.5.1.68.1	He should indeed make it for one who is born a year ago.
9.5.1.68.2	Breath is Agni.
9.5.1.68.3	It supports him.
9.5.1.68.4	Then indeed, when the semen has been deposited, the breath descends and finds it.
9.5.1.68.5	That which it finds when it is born and born, that is why it is called Jātavedas.
9.5.1.68.6	Therefore, one who knows this should make it even for one who is a year old.
9.5.1.68.7	Now, when one who knows this drinks or causes to be drunk, then it is as if all the oblations have been offered in the fire of the Sandilī, with its wings and tail, when it is piled up. Thus his oblations are offered.
9.5.2.1.1	Indra saw this seven-verse (hymn). For the attainment of the deficient, for the excess, for the prosperity of the fallen.
9.5.2.1.2	Now, indeed, one who has built the fire-altar and has committed some sin, or has been accused of a crime, or has been slandered,
9.5.2.1.3	When Śyāparṇa Sāyākāyana heard this, then he added this rite.
9.5.2.2.1	This is the prosperity of the three, the prosperity of Agni, the prosperity of him who builds the fire, the prosperity of he who builds the fire.
9.5.2.3.1	In that he worships with this, whatever he, whether knowing or not knowing, has destroyed here, or has not made up, all that becomes obtained for him by this, whatever of his is not obtained.
9.5.2.3.2	He who desires anything in that Anushtubh verse, obtains it here itself.
9.5.2.3.3	And from this very rite he wards off the Rakshas, the demons.
9.5.2.3.4	They do not afflict him.
9.5.2.3.5	Therefore, one who knows this should build a fire for someone else, if he so desires.
9.5.2.3.6	For the one who is in control is better than the one who is not.
9.5.2.5.2	The deer is not terrible, the mountain is the highest. With the two second verses of the Vamadhara (Samhita).
9.5.2.5.3	The gods, having killed the evil, performed this rite, having removed evil.
9.5.2.5.4	In the same way, the sacrificer, having killed the evils, performs this rite, having eliminated evil.
9.5.2.6.1	The Agni who is worshipped in heaven, the Agni who is worshipped on earth, the Agni who has been worshipped in the sky, the Agni who was worshipped in the waters, the Agni who will be worshipped in the waters.
9.5.2.6.2	With the third (verses).
9.5.2.6.3	The gods, having burnt sin with Vaiśvānara, performed this rite, having removed sin. In the same way the sacrificer, having burnt sin by Vaiśvānaran, performs this rite, having got rid of sin.
9.5.2.7.1	We have not seen the desire, O Agni, that is beyond thee.
9.5.2.7.2	With one verse addressed to Kāma, the gods, having removed sin by means of the six verses, and with one verse addressed to Kama, made all desires their own.
9.5.2.7.3	In the same way the sacrificer, having removed sin with the six verses, makes all desires his own with one verse addressed by Kama.
9.5.2.8.1	It consists of seven verses.
9.5.2.8.2	The Agni with seven layers, the seven seasons, the seven directions, the seven worlds of the gods, the seven Stomas, the seven Backs, the seven metres, the seven animals caught, the seven wild animals, the seven vital airs in the head, whatever is of seven kinds pertaining to the deity and the self, all that he obtains by this.
9.5.2.8.3	They merge into the Anushtubh.
9.5.2.8.4	Anushtubh is speech.
9.5.2.8.5	He obtains by speech whatever he has not obtained.
9.5.2.9.1	Some say, "One should worship with eight verses."
9.5.2.9.2	With the second verse, "We desire your favor today," which is about desire.
9.5.2.9.3	Seven verses are in the past tense.
9.5.2.9.4	That makes eight.
9.5.2.9.5	The Gayatri verse has eight syllables.
9.5.2.9.6	Agni is related to the Gayatri.
9.5.2.9.7	Whatever is the extent of Agni, whatever is his measure, by that much he attains whatever of his is not attained.
9.5.2.9.8	And thus they both worship the same deity."
9.5.2.9.9	One should not do so.
9.5.2.9.10	These indeed are the seven or eight Anushtubh verses.
9.5.2.9.11	He who recites eight, attains his desire here.
9.5.2.10.1	He worships with the verses addressed to Indra and Agni.
9.5.2.10.2-6	Indra-Agni is Agni. Whatever Agni is, whatever is his measure, so much does he obtain of it, whatever of his is not obtained. Indra and Agni are all the gods. Agni is of all the gods. Whatever Agni is, whatever his measure, so many does he obtain of them, whatever of them is not obtained.
9.5.2.11.1	Some perform this rite of the sacrifice itself, saying, "We shall perform this rite, free from sin."
9.5.2.11.2	Some say, "Having performed the fire-laying rite with the earth containing excrement, one should stand."
9.5.2.11.3	For there it becomes complete and perfect."
9.5.2.11.4	One should do as one wishes. This is the rule for the selection of the site.
9.5.2.11.5	Now, the rule for the non-selection of the site.
9.5.2.12.1	There are three oceans: Agni for the Yajus verses, the Mahāvrat for the Saman verses, and the Mahd for the Rk verses.
9.5.2.12.2	He who performs these for another dries up these oceans.
9.5.2.12.3	When they dry up, the metres dry up with them; the world with the metres; the self with the world; the beings and cattle with the self.
9.5.2.12.4	He who gives these to another becomes more and more sinful.
9.5.2.13.1	But he who, without performing these, performs other sacrifices for another, then from these very oceans the metres again flow forth; the metres follow the world, the world follows the Self, the Self follows the beings, the beings follow the cattle.
9.5.2.13.2	He who does not give these to another becomes better and better every day.
9.5.2.13.3	Now this is his divine immortal self.
9.5.2.13.4	He who gives these to another gives away that divine self to another.
9.5.2.13.5	Then only a dry stump remains.
9.5.2.14.1	Some do this, or have it done, saying, "This is the expiation."
9.5.2.14.2	One should not do it thus.
9.5.2.14.3	Just as one would sprinkle a dry post with water, so is it.
9.5.2.14.4	One may die or be afflicted.
9.5.2.14.5	One should know that there is no expiation for this.
9.5.2.15.1	Then indeed Shaṇḍilya said:
9.5.2.15.2	Turu, the son of Kauśika, performed the Agnihotra sacrifice for the gods in Kāvīṣī.
9.5.2.15.3	The gods asked him, "O sage, why did you perform the Agnihotra sacrifice in the village of Kāvīṣīs, where it is said to be forbidden?"
9.5.2.16.1	He replied,
9.5.2.16.2	"What is permitted?
9.5.2.16.3	What is forbidden?
9.5.2.16.4	The sacrificer is the self of the sacrifice, the priests are its limbs.
9.5.2.16.5	Where the self is, there are the limbs.
9.5.2.16.6	Where the limbs are, there is the self.
9.5.2.16.7	If the priests become non-existent, then the sacrificer also becomes non-existent.
9.5.2.16.8	Both become non-existent. They become non-existent together.
9.5.2.16.9	But there should be no dispute over the sacrificial fees.
9.5.2.16.10	By disputing, the priests become non existent.
10.1.1.1.1	This Agni is piled up in front, the year.
10.1.1.1.2	The great praise is praised above.
10.1.1.1.3	The first juice went from the scattered Prajapati.
10.1.1.2.1	That which was Prajapati, that which was scattered, that is the year.
10.1.1.2.2	And those which were his joints, which were scattered, they are the days and nights.
10.1.1.3.1	Now that year, which was Prajapati, fell apart. This is the same as the Agni who is being built here.
10.1.1.3.2	And those days and nights, the junctions, which fell apart, they are the bricks.
10.1.1.3.3	When he places these (bricks), he places in it those days and nights and junctions which fell apart.
10.1.1.3.4	This is the same mantra here. It is obtained here.
10.1.1.4.1	And that which is his best juice has gone to the great praise.
10.1.1.4.2	They follow that juice of his with the two Rk verses.
10.1.1.4.3	And that mantra which comes first there, it comes as if it is being brought forward.
10.1.1.4.4	As if he were to say, "I will bring that one thing from yonder," so does the Yajus go forth in front.
10.1.1.4.5	They attain it in a year.
10.1.1.5.1	The Adhvaryu seizes it with a cup.
10.1.1.5.2	Because he seizes it, therefore it is a cup.
10.1.1.5.3	In it the Udgata puts the essence with the Mahavrata.
10.1.1.5.4	All these are the Sama hymns, namely the Mahavrata.
10.1.1.5.5	In this (oblation) he places the essence of all (the verses).
10.1.1.5.6	In this (oblation), the Hotri places the essence by means of the great Utkha.
10.1.1.5.7	All these verses are the great Utktha.
10.1.1.5.8	In this (offering) he places the essential of all verses.
10.1.1.6.1	When they praise and when they recite the Anushtubh, then he offers this Vasat-call in it.
10.1.1.6.2	That very same essence enters him.
10.1.1.6.3	They do not see this as a praise of the great vow, but they see it as a great hymn.
10.1.1.6.4	They see Agni alone.
10.1.1.6.5	For Agni is the Self.
10.1.1.6.6	That very same essence enters them both, becoming the Ṛk and the Sāman.
10.1.1.6.7	The Yajus enters both the Ṛk-Sāman.
10.1.1.7.1	This is the fire of the pair, the first, second, third and fourth layers.
10.1.1.7.2	The fire that is deposited in the fifth layer is the pair.
10.1.1.7.3	This is the pair of the self.
10.1.1.8.1	The thumbs are the males, the fingers are the females.
10.1.1.8.2	The ears are male, the eyebrows are female.
10.1.1.8.3	The lips are male, the nostrils are female.
10.1.1.8.4	Teeth are male, the tongue is female.
10.1.1.8.5	All are a couple.
10.1.1.8.6	He goes to this fire with this couple, with his own self.
10.1.1.9.1	This is the meaning here.
10.1.1.9.2	Even so, one is a couple.
10.1.1.9.3-9	Thus indeed, it is the pair. This Agni which is being piled up is indeed speech. For speech is piled up. And that which is deposited in the piled up Agni is indeed Prāṇa. Prāṇa is the bull of speech, Prāṇa is the pair. Speech is indeed this Self. And that Prāṇa in the Self is the pair.
10.1.1.9.10	He thus approaches Agni, the Fire, with this pair, himself.
10.1.1.10.1	This is the approach here.
10.1.1.10.2	There is no doubt that he will have a son who knows thus the two pairs, himself and Agni.
10.1.1.10.3	This self is indeed food.
10.1.1.10.4	He who eats the food of the right, for the sage has said, 'The Self.'
10.1.1.11.1	This food eaten becomes twofold.
10.1.1.11.2	What is immortal above it, that goes beyond the navel.
10.1.1.11.3	It goes up with the upward-moving breaths.
10.1.1.11.4	It goes to the wind.
10.1.1.11.5	And what is mortal below it, that goes below the navel.
10.1.1.11.6	That which becomes two, it goes to this (earth), urine and excrement.
10.1.1.11.7	That which goes to this (world), that Agni is kindled. It goes to that.
10.1.1.11.8	That which (Agni) goes to the wind, that Agni is deposited in the fire. It goes to him.
10.1.1.11.9	This is the only going here.
10.1.2.1.1	Prajapati desired these worlds.
10.1.2.1.2	He saw this self in the form of Agni.
10.1.2.1.3	He created it.
10.1.2.1.4	By that he attained this world.
10.1.2.1.5	He saw the second self in the form, of Mahāvrata.
10.1.2.1.6	He created that.
10.1.2.1.7	By that, he attained the atmosphere.
10.1.2.1.8	He saw his third self in the form Mahāuktha.
10.1.2.1.9	He created this.
10.1.2.1.10	By that attained heaven.
10.1.2.2.1-3	This very world is the fire that is built, the sky is the Great Vrata, heaven is the Great Praise. Therefore one should offer all these together, the fire, the Great Vrata and the Great Praise. For these worlds were created together.
10.1.2.5.1	The head is Agni.
10.1.2.5.2	The breath is the Mahāvrat.
10.1.2.5.3	The self is the great Utkha.
10.1.2.5.4	Therefore one should offer all these together.
10.1.2.5.5	For the head, breath and self are together.
10.1.2.5.6	That Agni is offered first, because the head is the first to be born when one is born.
10.1.2.5.7	Therefore, when all these are done together, the self is proclaimed as the great Utkham.
10.1.2.5.8	The Self is the great praise.
10.1.2.6.1	They say, "Which of these are the most difficult to obtain?"
10.1.2.6.2	The Agniṣṭoma is the Jyotiṣṭoma.
10.1.2.6.3	One should offer sacrifice with the Jyotiṣtoma.
10.1.2.7.1	Of this Jyotiṣṭomam Agniṣṭoma, the Bahispavamāna is three-fold.
10.1.2.7.2	That is the head of the vow.
10.1.2.7.3	The Pavamāna hymns are fifteen and seventeen.
10.1.2.7.4	They are the two wings.
10.1.2.7.5	The Hotr's oblation is fifteen, the Prstha is seventeen, the Yajñāyajñiya is twenty-one.
10.1.2.7.6	That is the tail.
10.1.2.8.1	Of these two, the fifteen and the seventeen, there are thirty-two Stotriya verses.
10.1.2.8.2	Of these, the twenty-five are the twenty-five Self.
10.1.2.8.3	Now those seven which go beyond, they are the Parimādas.
10.1.2.8.4	These are the animals.
10.1.2.8.5	The animals are the Parimāda.
10.1.2.8.6	This is the great vow.
10.1.2.8.7	Here he attains that great vow.
10.1.2.9.1	Then the Hotṛ recites the seven metres, the extra four, the Viraj with eight.
10.1.2.9.2	Of these, three hundred and eighty are the syllables, and forty-five.
10.1.2.9.3	Then those eighty are the attainment of eighty.
10.1.2.9.4	For eighty is said to be a great hymn.
10.1.2.9.5	Then of those forty-five, twenty-five are the twenty-five Self.
10.1.2.9.6	Where there is the self, that is the head, those are the wings and tail.
10.1.2.9.7	And the twenty which are there, that is the covering.
10.1.2.9.8	This much is the great Ukhtha.
10.1.2.9.9	Herein he obtains this great Ukhtha itself.
10.1.2.9.10	All these are obtained in the Jyotistoma Agniṣṭoma.
10.1.2.9.11	Therefore one should offer sacrifice with the Jyotiṣṭoma Agniṣṭoma alone.
10.1.3.1.1	Prajapati created the creatures.
10.1.3.1.2	He created the gods from the upward-moving breaths, and the mortal creatures from the downward-moving breaths.
10.1.3.1.3	And he created Death, the eater of creatures, above them.
10.1.3.2.1	Of that Prajapati, half was mortal and half immortal.
10.1.3.2.2	Now, what was his mortal part, by that he feared death.
10.1.3.2.3	Fearing, he entered this duality, becoming earth and water.
10.1.3.3.1	Death said to the gods, "Where is he who created us?"
10.1.3.3.2	"He entered this (duality) fearing you."
10.1.3.3.3	He said, "Let us search for him, let us bring him back. I will not harm him."
10.1.3.3.4	The gods brought him back to her.
10.1.3.3.5	What was in her, that was in the water, they brought back the water. Then what was in her,
10.1.3.3.6	that was in the earth, they brought back that earth. Having brought back both, the earth and the water, they made a brick.
10.1.3.3.7	Therefore, both of these are bricks: clay and water.
10.1.3.4.1	These five mortal bodies of him were: hair, skin, flesh, bone, and marrow.
10.1.3.4.2	And these are the immortal ones: mind, speech, breath, sight, and hearing.
10.1.3.5.1	He who was that Prajapati, he is indeed this Agni who is being piled up.
10.1.3.5.2	Now those five mortal bodies of his were the bricks made of clay.
10.1.3.5.3	And those immortal ones were the bricks made out of stone.
10.1.3.6.1	The gods said, "Let us make this one immortal."
10.1.3.6.2	Having taken this mortal body with these two immortal bodies, they made it immortal with the bricks and the layers of earth. So also the second, so also the third, so also the fourth.
10.1.3.7.1	Having placed the fifth layer, he pours down the earth.
10.1.3.7.2	There he places the oblique and the self-perforated bricks.
10.1.3.7.3	He sprinkles with pieces of gold.
10.1.3.7.4	He places the fire.
10.1.3.7.5	That is the seventh layer.
10.1.3.7.6	That is immortality.
10.1.3.7.7	Thus, having surrounded this mortal body with these two immortal bodies, he made it immortal with the layers of bricks.
10.1.3.7.8	Then indeed Prajapati became immortal.
10.1.3.7.9	In the same way, the sacrificer, having made himself immortal, becomes immortal.
10.1.3.8.1	The gods did not know him, whether they made him all or not all, whether they restrained him too much or not enough.
10.1.3.8.2	They saw this verse:
10.1.3.8.3	Agni, Indra, Brahma, the god Brihaspati,
10.1.3.8.4	The gods of the world, with their minds, have brought us the sacrifice, the auspicious.
10.1.3.9.1	It has an Agniya, an Indra, and a Vaishvadeva.
10.1.3.9.2	What is its Agniya, that is Agni's Agniya; what is its Indra, that is Indra's Indra; what is its Vaishvadeva, that is Vaishvadeva's Vaishvadeva.
10.1.3.9.3	Herein he makes everything complete.
10.1.3.10.1	Whatever he does or does not do, whatever he knows or does not know, whatever he recites or does not recite, all that he obtains by this (verse).
10.1.3.10.2	The Anushtubh is the Dhamaccha.
10.1.3.10.3	Speech is the Anushtubh.
10.1.3.10.4	Speech is Dhamaccha.
10.1.3.10.5	Whatever is not obtained by him, he obtains by speech.
10.1.3.10.6	Some say that one should stand by the fire-pit containing excrement, because there it becomes complete.
10.1.3.11.1	But they say that one should rather stand by the fire of the eldest.
10.1.3.11.2	For this is his beloved abode, that he is the eldest.
10.1.3.11.3-7	Whatever is his beloved abode, by that he obtains whatever is not obtained by him. By the Agniyeya (verse). For Agni is the rite of the Gayatri. Agni is the Gayatri. Whatever is the extent of Agni, by that much he obtains whatever is obtained by him. Whatever is not obtained by the Anirukta (verse). The Anirukta is everything.
10.1.3.11.8	He obtains everything that he does not obtain.
10.1.3.11.9	"He is the most excellent, O giver of gifts." The relation of this is stated.
10.1.3.11.10	Having made the fire-altar with the earth, one should worship it.
10.1.3.11.11	For there it becomes all and complete.
10.1.4.1.1	In the beginning, indeed, Prajapati was both mortal and immortal.
10.1.4.1.2	His vital airs were immortal, and the body was mortal.
10.1.4.1.3	By this rite he makes himself one with the immortal Self, which is covered by one layer.
10.1.4.1.4	In the same way, the sacrificer becomes both mortal and immortal.
10.1.4.1.5	His vital airs become immortal, and his body mortal.
10.1.4.1.6	By this rite he makes his Self one with the immortal, which is covered with one layer.
10.1.4.2.1	He builds the first layer.
10.1.4.2.2	This is his breath.
10.1.4.2.3	That indeed is the immortal.
10.1.4.2.4	For breath is immortal.
10.1.4.2.5	This is the immortal layer.
10.1.4.2.6	Then he pours down the excrement.
10.1.4.2.7	This is his marrow.
10.1.4.2.8	That indeed becomes mortal.
10.1.4.2.9	For marrow is mortal.
10.1.4.2.10	He establishes this in the immortal.
10.1.4.2.11	By that this becomes immortal.
10.1.4.3.1	He lays down the second layer.
10.1.4.3.2	This is indeed his own breath.
10.1.4.3.3	That indeed is the immortal.
10.1.4.3.4	For the out-breath is indeed immortal.
10.1.4.3.5	This is the layer of the immortal.
10.1.4.3.6	This mortal (layer) he encloses on both sides with the immortal (layer).
10.1.4.3.7	Thus this becomes immortal for him.
10.1.4.3.8	Then he pours down the dung.
10.1.4.3.9	That is his bone.
10.1.4.3.10	That indeed is mortal.
10.1.4.3.11	For bone is mortal.
10.1.4.3.12	He establishes that in the immortal.
10.1.4.3.13	By that it becomes immortal for him.
10.1.4.4.1	He builds the third layer.
10.1.4.4.2	That indeed for him is the Prāṇa.
10.1.4.4.3	That indeed becomes immortal.
10.1.4.4.4	For Prāṇa is immortal.
10.1.4.4.5	This is the heap of nectar.
10.1.4.4.6	This mortal (body) is surrounded on both sides by nectar.
10.1.4.4.7	By that it becomes immortal.
10.1.4.4.8	Then he puts down the excrement.
10.1.4.4.9	That is his sinew.
10.1.4.4.10	That is indeed mortal.
10.1.4.4.11	Sinew is mortal.
10.1.4.4.12	He establishes that in this immortal.
10.1.4.4.13	That makes this (citī) of his immortal.
10.1.4.5.1	He builds the fourth layer.
10.1.4.5.2	That is his Udanas (vital breath).
10.1.4.5.3	That indeed is immortal.
10.1.4.5.4	For the Udanas are immortal.
10.1.4.5.5	This is the immortal layer.
10.1.4.5.6	This mortal (layer) he encloses on both sides with the immortal (layers).
10.1.4.5.7	That makes this (layer) of his immortal.
10.1.4.5.8	Then he throws down the excrement.
10.1.4.5.9	This is his flesh.
10.1.4.5.10	This is mortal.
10.1.4.5.11	For flesh is mortal.
10.1.4.5.12	He establishes this in the immortal.
10.1.4.5.13	This becomes immortal for him.
10.1.4.6.1	He builds the fifth layer.
10.1.4.6.2	This is the same for him.
10.1.4.6.3	This is immortal.
10.1.4.6.4	For the same is immortal.
10.1.4.6.5	This is the heap of nectar.
10.1.4.6.6	This mortal (body) is surrounded on both sides by nectar.
10.1.4.6.7	By that it becomes immortal.
10.1.4.6.8	Then he puts down the dung.
10.1.4.6.9	That is his fat.
10.1.4.6.10	That is indeed mortal.
10.1.4.6.11	Fat is mortal.
10.1.4.6.12	He establishes that in this immortal.
10.1.4.6.13	That makes this (cit) immortal for him.
10.1.4.7.1	He builds the sixth layer.
10.1.4.7.2	That is his speech.
10.1.4.7.3	That indeed is immortal.
10.1.4.7.4	For speech is immortal.
10.1.4.7.5	That is the immortal layer.
10.1.4.7.6	That mortal (cit) he encloses on both sides with the immortal (cit).
10.1.4.7.7	That makes this (cit of the dead) immortal for him
10.1.4.7.8	Then he pours down the earth.
10.1.4.7.9	That is its blood, that is its skin.
10.1.4.7.10	That indeed is mortal.
10.1.4.7.11	For blood is mortal, skin is mortal.
10.1.4.7.12	He establishes it in this immortal (fire).
10.1.4.7.13	By that it becomes immortal.
10.1.4.8.1	Those are the six bricks, the six mortar-layers.
10.1.4.8.2	That makes twelve.
10.1.4.8.3	Twelve months are a year.
10.1.4.8.4	The year is Agni.
10.1.4.8.5	As much as Agni is, as much as is his measure, by so much Prajapati made himself immortal and one-holed.
10.1.4.8.6	In the same way the sacrificer makes himself immortal and oneholed.
10.1.4.9.1	Having placed the Vikarni and the Svayamatrna, he sprinkles with pieces of gold.
10.1.4.9.2	He places Agni in front.
10.1.4.9.3	Indeed, Prajapati made the golden form at the end of himself.
10.1.4.9.4	Since it was at the end, therefore this is the last form of the self.
10.1.4.9.5	Therefore they say, "Prajapati is golden."
10.1.4.9.6	In the same way, the sacrificer makes the golden form at his own end.
10.1.4.9.7	Now, that which is at the end, that is the last form of the Self.
10.1.4.9.8	Therefore, those who know this and those who do not know this, they say that the golden Agni is present in that world.
10.1.4.10.1	Now, this was debated by the teachers Chandilya and Saptarathavahani and their students.
10.1.4.10.2	This is his form, says Sandilya Lohani, the son of Saptarathavaha.
10.1.4.11.1	Sandilya said, "Form is indeed the form with hair, the form without hair."
10.1.4.11.2	This is his form."
10.1.4.11.3	It is as Sandilya said.
10.1.4.11.4	The fire is carried when it is heaped up.
10.1.4.11.5	From the offering of the oblations, the oblations are offered upwards.
10.1.4.12.1	The gods eat food with the breath.
10.1.4.12.2	Agni is the breath of the gods.
10.1.4.12.3	Therefore they offer to the gods first.
10.1.4.12.4	For the gods eat food with breath.
10.1.4.12.5	Humans eat food with the out-breath.
10.1.4.12.6	Therefore food is placed behind humans.
10.1.4.12.7	For it is by means of Apāna that men eat food.
10.1.4.13.1	They say, "One should not eat at the fire of one who is building a fire-altar."
10.1.4.13.2	For he who builds a fire-altar becomes of the form of Vayu.
10.1.4.13.3	Vayu is the lord of distress.
10.1.4.13.4	Therefore one should not eat at a fire-altar being built.
10.1.4.13.5	But one who knows this may eat at will.
10.1.4.13.6	This is the form of Agni, for one who builds an altar.
10.1.4.13.7	All this is Agni's food.
10.1.4.13.8	One who knows this should know that all this is his food.
10.1.4.14.1	They say, what is done in the fire by which the sacrificer conquers death again?
10.1.4.14.2	Agni indeed is the deity for one who builds an altar.
10.1.4.14.3	Agni is indeed immortality.
10.1.4.14.4	The gods are prosperity.
10.1.4.14.5	One goes to prosperity.
10.1.4.14.6	The gods (are) fame.
10.1.4.14.7	One who knows this becomes famous.
10.1.5.1.1	All these sacrifices are indeed the one who builds this altar.
10.1.5.1.2	When he offers a sacrifice to Agni, that is the Agnihotra.
10.1.5.2.4	They offer oblations to Agni with the same mantra.
10.1.5.2.5	The Vanivāhana and the carrying of ashes are the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices.
10.1.5.2.6	The Garhapatya fire is the Cāturmāsya sacrifices.
10.1.5.2.7	The fire above the Garhapatya and below the Sarvauṣadha are the Iṣṭi sacrifices.
10.1.5.2.8	Then those animal-sacrifices which are above all the herbs and before the layers.
10.1.5.2.9	Those which are in these sacrifices are the Vishnu-steps.
10.1.5.2.10	What is to be recited is the Vatsapra.
10.1.5.3.1	The Soma-sacrifice is the first layer.
10.1.5.3.2	What is before the Savas is the Rajasuya, the second.
10.1.5.3.3	The Vajapeya is the third.
10.1.5.3.4	The Asvamedha is the fourth.
10.1.5.3.5	The Agnisava is the fifth.
10.1.5.3.6	What is sung with the Sāmans is the Mahāvrata.
10.1.5.3.7	What is the muttering of the Udgātṛ in front of that is the Śatarudriya.
10.1.5.3.8	The Vāso-dhārā is the great Uktha.
10.1.5.4.2	He who offers Agnihotra in this world eats in the other world.
10.1.5.4.3	The sacrifice is of that much extent.
10.1.5.4.4	One who offers the Darsha-Pūrnamāsa sacrifices every fortnight,
10.1.5.4.5	One who offers Cāturmāsya sacrifices every four months,
10.1.5.4.6	One who makes animal sacrifices every six months,
10.1.5.4.7	One offers Soma sacrifices every year,
10.1.5.4.8	He who offers Agni-worship for a hundred years, eats and drinks as he pleases.
10.1.5.4.9	This is the extent of the hundred years, the immortal, the endless, the boundless.
10.1.5.4.10	He who knows this, his immortality, his endlessness, his boundlessness, are indeed so.
10.1.5.4.11	Whatever he may do, even if it be like a mere act of eating, that becomes his immortality, his boundlessness.
10.2.1.1.1	Prajapati desired heaven.
10.2.1.1.2	All animals are Prajapati, man, horse, cow, sheep, and goat.
10.2.1.1.3	He was not able to attain them in these forms.
10.2.1.1.4	He saw himself in the form of Agni.
10.2.1.1.5	He created it.
10.2.1.1.6	He fell down without supporting himself.
10.2.1.1.7	He was unable.
10.2.1.1.8	He then rises up, having covered himself.
10.2.1.1.9	Even now the birds fly up only when their wings have grown and their feathers have fallen off.
10.2.1.2.1	He measures it with his fingers.
10.2.1.2.2	Man is the sacrifice.
10.2.1.2.3	By him all this is measured.
10.2.1.2.4	His smallest measure is the fingers.
10.2.1.2.5	Whatever is the measure of that, he attains that. By that he measures him.
10.2.1.3.1	He measures with twenty-four fingers.
10.2.1.3.2	The Gayatri has twenty-four syllables.
10.2.1.3.3	Agni is Gayatri.
10.2.1.3.4	Whatever is the measure of Agni, by that he measures him.
10.2.1.4.1	He cuts it off four fingers on both sides. He cuts off four fingers on the outside of both sides.
10.2.1.4.2	He cuts it off as much as he cuts off.
10.2.1.4.3	He does not cut it off too much or too little.
10.2.1.4.4	Similarly, he does it to the tail and the upper wing.
10.2.1.5.1	Then he makes the wings hang down.
10.2.1.5.2-7	The two wings of the body are bent down in the third year. In the third year, the two wings of the human body are bent down. In the fourth year, the two sides of the human body bend down. In this fourth year, the human body bends down on both sides. He takes four fingers forward and four fingers backward.
10.2.1.5.8	As much as he raises, so much he lowers.
10.2.1.5.9	He does not make it too high or too low.
10.2.1.6.1	He places one brick in that hole.
10.2.1.6.2	He makes it like the one hole in the body of a bird that is falling down and has stopped.
10.2.1.6.3	And also this.
10.2.1.7.1	Then he makes the two curves.
10.2.1.7.2	The two wings of the fire-altar are crooked, for the wings of a bird are crooked.
10.2.1.7.3	He takes it back four inches, and then brings it forward four inches.
10.2.1.7.4	He takes as much as he brings forward.
10.2.1.7.5	He does not take too much nor too little.
10.2.1.8.1	Then he makes the best form.
10.2.1.8.2	Here all the fire is made.
10.2.1.8.3	In that (fire) the gods placed this excellent form.
10.2.1.8.4	In the same way he places this excellent form in it.
10.2.1.8.5	He makes bricks inscribed with a thousand straight lines.
10.2.1.8.6	A thousand means inscribed.
10.2.1.8.7	A thousand is inscribed.
10.2.1.9.1	Having placed the fifth layer of bricks, he measures the fire in three ways.
10.2.1.9.2	He places the bricks in the middle, in the third thousand, drawn straight.
10.2.1.9.3	He makes those hairs of the body which are straight, from the head to the tail, straight.
10.2.1.10.1	Then he places the bricks drawn straight, in the south, in the thousand.
10.2.1.10.2	He makes the hairs of the body, which are crooked on the right side,
10.2.1.11.1	Then he places the thousand bricks written as 'Sahasra' on the northern side.
10.2.1.11.2	This is the form of the thousand bricks.
10.2.1.11.3	With the thousand.
10.2.1.11.4	The thousand is the whole.
10.2.1.11.5	He thus places the supreme form in him with the whole.
10.2.1.11.6	With three thousands.
10.2.1.11.7	Agni is threefold.
10.2.1.11.8	Whatever is the extent of Agni, whatever is his measure, by that much he places this supreme form in him.
10.2.2.1.1	Those who made those seven men into one man, he became Prajapati.
10.2.2.1.2	He created beings.
10.2.2.1.3	Having created beings, he ascended upwards.
10.2.2.1.4	He went to this world where he shines.
10.2.2.1.5	But then there was no other sacrifice here than this.
10.2.2.1.6	The gods wanted to sacrifice to him by means of sacrifice.
10.2.2.2.1	Therefore this was said by the Rishi: "The gods sacrificed to the sacrifice by means of sacrifice."
10.2.2.2.2	For the gods sacrificed to that sacrifice by means of the sacrifice.
10.2.2.2.3	Those were the first rites.
10.2.2.2.4	For those rites were performed first.
10.2.2.2.5	They go to the heaven of greatness.
10.2.2.2.6	The heaven is the world of heaven.
10.2.2.2.7	The gods are greatness.
10.2.2.2.8	Those gods who performed that sacrifice go to the heavenly world. This is what is meant.
10.2.2.3.1	Where the gods of the Sadhyas are present.
10.2.2.3.2	The gods of the Sadhya are the vital airs.
10.2.2.3.3	They accomplished this first, desiring this very thing.
10.2.2.3.4	They are indeed accomplishing it now.
10.2.2.3.5	"If now this other thing has become the sacrificial place of the immortal world, the abode of the gods."
10.2.2.3.6	"Now this other thing has indeed become the sacrificial place, whatever is immortal."
10.2.2.4.1	"The bird Garutman, the son of Savitar, was born first, and he follows her in her duty."
10.2.2.4.2	Prajapati is the bird Garutman.
10.2.2.4.3	This is Savitar.
10.2.2.4.4	This is the Dharma of Prajapati.
10.2.2.5.1	He becomes seven-purusha.
10.2.2.5.2	This man is seven-purusha, because the body is four and the wings and tail are three.
10.2.2.5.3	For this man, the body is four, and the wings and the tail are three.  
10.2.2.6.1	He measures it with a man whose arms are outstretched.
10.2.2.6.2	Man is the sacrifice.
10.2.2.6.3	By that everything here is measured.
10.2.2.7.2	He places that power in the wings.
10.2.2.7.3	The wings are the arms.
10.2.2.7.4	Food is eaten with the arms.
10.2.2.7.5	He makes room for food.
10.2.2.7.6	He places the pins in the wings, because food is eaten within the span of the arms.
10.2.2.8.1	Then he places the span in the tail.
10.2.2.8.2	He places that power in stability.
10.2.2.8.3	The tail is the foundation, the arm is the span.
10.2.2.8.4	One eats food with the arm.
10.2.2.8.5	He makes room for food.
10.2.2.8.6	When he places the span on the tail, he thereby establishes him in food.
10.2.2.8.7	When one places the smaller one there, one thereby establishes him in the food.
10.2.2.8.8	Now, this is the measure of what is limited. This is the measure of it.
10.2.2.8.9	When one measures in this way, it is for the attainment of this.
10.2.3.1.1	This is the measure of the altar which is sevenfold.
10.2.3.1.2	Having decided on the place of sacrifice, he enters the wives' hall through the eastern door and sprinkles water for the Garhapatya.
10.2.3.1.3	From the Garhapatya, he measures seven steps towards the east.
10.2.3.1.4	Then he measures a span towards the east. 
10.2.3.1.5	In the middle of that, he pours down from the Avakāśa of the Āhavanīya.
10.2.3.1.6	From the eastern half of the span, he measures three steps towards the east,
10.2.3.1.7	which is the boundary of the Vedi.
10.2.3.2.1	These are the eleven spans between the boundary of the altar and the Garhapatyā.
10.2.3.3.4	From this very womb the gods generated the Garhapatya, from the Garhapaty the Ahavaniya.
10.2.3.4.1	He measures out the altar, which is thirty-six steps long, towards the east, thirty steps long towards the west, and twenty-four steps long towards the front.
10.2.3.4.2	That makes ninety.
10.2.3.4.3	This is the altar which is ninety steps long.
10.2.3.4.4	In that (fire-altar) he establishes the seven kinds of fire.
10.2.3.5.1	They say, how does this sevenfold (fire) come to be accomplished by means of this Veda?
10.2.3.5.2	There are ten breaths in man, four limbs, and the self is the fifteenth.
10.2.3.5.3	Thus the second, thus the third.
10.2.3.5.4	Ninety in six men.
10.2.3.5.5	Then one man exceeds.
10.2.3.5.6	The man is fivefold: hair, skin, flesh, bone, and marrow.
10.2.3.5.7	This altar is fivefold: four directions and the fifth, the self.
10.2.3.5.8	Thus he becomes sevenfold by means of this altar.
10.2.3.6.1	Some increase these steps and this span by adding a northern step, saying, "We increase the womb."
10.2.3.6.2	One should not do so.
10.2.3.6.3	The womb does not grow when the embryo is born.
10.2.3.6.4	As long as the embryo is inside the womb, the womb grows.
10.2.3.6.5	This is the extent of the growth of the embryo here.
10.2.3.7.1	Those who do so, they destroy their father Prajapati and his prosperity.
10.2.3.7.2	Having performed the sacrifice, they become worse.
10.2.3.7.3	The Pitrs, the Prajapati, and the prosperity (of the sacrificer) are destroyed.
10.2.3.7.4	He measures out the altar of the fourteen-fold sacrifice, as much as the altar of the seven-fold sacrifice.
10.2.3.8.1	Then he measures out a rope of thirty-six steps.
10.2.3.8.2	He divides it into seven parts.
10.2.3.8.3	He places three parts towards the east and throws away four.
10.2.3.11.1	Now the directions of Agni.
10.2.3.11.2	Twenty-eight men are in the east, twenty-eight in the west.
10.2.3.11.3	That is the Self.
10.2.3.11.4	Fourteen men are the right wing, fourteen the left wing, fourteen the tail.
10.2.3.11.5	He places fourteen inches in the right wing, in the left wing, and fourteen inches in the tail.
10.2.3.11.6	Thus is the measure of the nine hundred and eighty men.
10.2.3.12.1	Then he measures a rope of three men's length.
10.2.3.12.2	He divides it into seven parts.
10.2.3.12.3	He places four parts on himself, three on the wings and tail.
10.2.3.13.1	Then he makes a measuring rod of the length of an arm.
10.2.3.13.2	He divides that into seven parts.
10.2.3.13.3	He places three parts of it on the right wing, and releases four on the left.
10.2.3.14.1	Then he measures a span.
10.2.3.14.2	He divides it into seven parts.
10.2.3.14.3	He places three parts of that on the tail, and releases four.
10.2.3.14.4	Thus this (altar) becomes one hundred and one-fold by this altar.
10.2.3.15.1	They say, "How is it that when thirteen men cross over, these (men) do not fall short of their respective shares?"
10.2.3.15.2	The share of the seventh man is the same as the share of all of them.
10.2.3.16.1	They say, "Prajapati himself created himself. Where there was a deficiency in him, he filled it up with these (men). Thus he became complete.
10.2.3.17.1	Some make the first one-fold, then one-plus, then unlimited.
10.2.3.17.2	One should not do so.
10.2.3.18.1	Prajapati was created first in seven ways.
10.2.3.18.2	He created himself.
10.2.3.18.3	He stood in one hundred and one ways.
10.2.3.18.4	He who creates beyond the seven ways, he severs the father Prajapati.
10.2.3.18.5	He who kills a superior being becomes a sinner.
10.2.3.18.6	Then he makes it a hundred and one-fold.
10.2.3.18.7	He is excluded from all this.
10.2.3.18.8	For this entire world is Prajapati.
10.2.3.18.9	Therefore, one should first make it seven-fold, then one hundred and one-folds.
10.2.3.18.10	One should not make it a hundred and eleven-fold.
10.2.4.1.5	Having divided himself into a hundred parts, he offered Agni and all desires to himself.
10.2.4.1.6	He became all desires.
10.2.4.1.7	From that, no desire remained outside.
10.2.4.1.8	Therefore, they say, "The year is all desires."
10.2.4.1.9	There is no desire outside the year.
10.2.4.2.1	In the same way, the sacrificer, having divided himself into a hundred parts, takes all desires into himself in the fire.
10.2.4.2.2	He becomes all desires.
10.2.4.2.3	Therefore, no desire is outside him.
10.2.4.3.1	That which is the year, that is the sun.
10.2.4.3.2	It is this one hundredfold.
10.2.4.3.3	Its rays are the hundredfold divisions.
10.2.4.3.4	This is the hundredth (verse). He who shines here is established in all this.
10.2.4.3.5	In the same way, the sacrificer, having divided himself into a hundred, is established in all of this.
10.2.4.4.1	Or, he who is of a hundred kinds becomes united with the seven kinds.
10.2.4.4.2	The sun is divided into a hundred kinds and is established in the seven worlds of the gods.
10.2.4.4.3	There are seven worlds of the gods, four directions, and three worlds.
10.2.4.4.4	These are the seven worlds of the Gods.
10.2.4.4.5	He is established in them.
10.2.4.4.6	In the same way, the sacrificer, having divided himself into one hundred and one, is established in the seven worlds of gods.
10.2.4.5.1	The sun, indeed, is divided into one hundred and one ways, and is established in the seven seasons, the seven Stoma-s, the seven Prstha-s, the six Chanda-s, the five Pranas, and the seven directions.
10.2.4.5.2	In the same way, the sacrificer, having divided himself into one hundred and seven ways, is established in all this.
10.2.4.6.1	The one hundred and one-fold (Veda) is established in the seven-fold (Vedic texts). The sun is divided into one hundred and one ways, and is established in the Brahman consisting of seven syllables.
10.2.4.6.2	The Brahman consists of seven syllables. One syllable is the Yajur Veda, two are the Sama Veda.
10.2.4.6.3	And whatever is other than that, that is Brahman. The Brahman consists of two syllables.
10.2.4.6.4	This entire (universe) is the seven-syllabled Brahman.
10.2.4.6.5	In this (universe) he is established.
10.2.4.6.6	In the same way, the sacrificer, having made himself one hundred times, is established in the seven-syllabic Brahman.
10.2.4.7.1	Therefore they build up with sevens.
10.2.4.7.2	Therefore, the one hundred and one kinds of sacrifice are accomplished in the seven kinds, and then the seven kinds are accomplished in the one hundred and eleven kinds.
10.2.4.8.1	Or indeed, the seven kinds of Prajapati were created first.
10.2.4.8.2	He saw that he himself was divided into one hundred and one.
10.2.4.8.3	Among those who possess life, there are fifty bricks and fifty yajus verses, making one hundred. The one hundred and eleventh is the dwelling place and the offerings.
10.2.4.8.4	Having placed that (earth) in the same manner, he recites the Sūda and Doha verses.
10.2.4.8.5	He conquered this victory and this portion by this hundredfold rite.
10.2.4.8.6	In the same way, the sacrificer conquers this victory and this part by this hundredfold ritual.
10.2.4.8.7	Thus the sevenfold becomes one hundredfold.
10.2.4.8.8	The one hundred and sevenfold is the sevenfold, and the sevenfold is the one hundred and seven-fold.
10.2.4.8.9	Thus are the modes.
10.2.5.1.1	Now, indeed, of the selection itself.
10.2.5.1.2	He selects at the Antaropavasatha.
10.2.5.1.3	The gods were afraid, thinking, "What if the Rākṣasas, the fiends, do not kill him here?"
10.2.5.1.4	They saw these cities in front, these very worlds.
10.2.5.1.5	These are the worlds in front.
10.2.5.1.6	They attained them.
10.2.5.1.7	Having attained them, they made this self safe from fear and danger.
10.2.5.1.8	In the same way, the sacrificer here attains these worlds in front, and makes this self safe from danger and fear.
10.2.5.2.1	What he builds in the Antaropa Sada rites,
10.2.5.2.2	The gods were afraid of this, thinking, "May the Rākṣasas and demons not kill him here."
10.2.5.2.3	They saw these Upasads as weapons.
10.2.5.2.4	The Upasads are weapons.
10.2.5.2.5	They approached them.
10.2.5.2.6	Approaching them, they made this self safe from fear and danger.
10.2.5.2.7	In the same way, the sacrificer, having approached these thunderbolts, makes this self safe and free from injury.
10.2.5.3.1	This indeed is austerity in the sacrifice, namely the Upasads.
10.2.5.3.2	The Upasads are indeed austerity.
10.2.5.3.3	What is performed in austerity, that is Tapashci.
10.2.5.3.4	As long as they perform the Upasads, so long they perform with the Pravargya.
10.2.5.3.5	They perform the Upasads for a year and the Pravargya for a year.
10.2.5.4.1	The Upasads are the days and nights.
10.2.5.4.2	The Pravargya is the sun.
10.2.5.4.3	He establishes that sun in the days and nights,
10.2.5.4.4	and therefore it is established in the days and night.
10.2.5.5.1	Now if there are twenty-four.
10.2.5.5.2	Twenty-four are the half-months.
10.2.5.5.3	The half-months are the Upasads.
10.2.5.5.4	The sun is the Pravargya.
10.2.5.5.5	He establishes that sun in the half-months.
10.2.5.5.6	Therefore he is established in the half-moons.
10.2.5.6.1	Now if there are twelve.
10.2.5.6.2	Twelve are the months.
10.2.5.6.3	The months are the Upasad.
10.2.5.6.4	The sun (is the Pravargya).
10.2.5.6.5	He establishes that Sun in the months.
10.2.5.6.6	Therefore he is established in the months.
10.2.5.7.1	Now if there are six,
10.2.5.7.2	there are six seasons.
10.2.5.7.3	The seasons are the Upasads.
10.2.5.7.4	The Pravargya is the sun.
10.2.5.7.5	He establishes that sun in the seasons.
10.2.5.7.6	Therefore he is established in seasons.
10.2.5.8.1	Now if three,
10.2.5.8.2	there are three worlds.
10.2.5.8.3	These worlds are the Upasad.
10.2.5.9.4	The spring season is the time of love. He should enjoy it to the full.
10.2.5.10.1	The second month is the time of excrement.
10.2.5.10.2	This is the extent of the love in the summer season.
10.2.5.10.3	The summer season is the time when love is enjoyed to the full. He should enjoy
10.2.5.11.1	it to the full. The third month is the time for excrement.
10.2.5.11.2	The extent of love in the rainy season.
10.2.5.11.3	Whatever desire there is during the rainy season, he concentrates his entire self on that.
10.2.5.12.1	The fourth month is the month of excrement.
10.2.5.12.2	This is the desire during the autumn season.
10.2.5.12.3	Whatever desire there is during autumn, he concentrates his whole self on that.
10.2.5.13.1	Then he lays down the first Praharana of the Viraj of the fifth layer, the Stomabhāga, one by one every day.
10.2.5.13.2	He settles them once, and once he recites the Soodadoha.
10.2.5.13.3	Silently they bring in the Stomabhäga-pūriṣa for a month.
10.2.5.13.4	This is the extent of desire in the winter season.
10.2.5.13.5	The man, in the winter season, takes in himself all that is of him.
10.2.5.14.1	The sixth month is the excrement.
10.2.5.14.2	This is the extent of the desire in the winter season.
10.2.5.14.3	The man, in the spring season, takes in all that is of himself.
10.2.5.14.4	This is all the desire in the twelve months and six seasons.
10.2.5.14.5	Whatever desire there is in twelve months, in six seasons, he obtains all that for himself.
10.2.5.15.1	Then they perform three days: the day of the Satrurudra sacrifice, the day of fasting, and the day of the Prasut offering.
10.2.5.15.2	When they perform those days together, those are the days and nights of that month.
10.2.5.15.3	Now, when he establishes the sun in the rite of Pravargya, it is in the truth.
10.2.5.15.4	This much is the desire in the thirteen months and in the seven seasons.
10.2.5.15.5	He thus gathers all that is his own, as much as is the desire in thirteen months and in seven seasons.
10.2.5.16.1	One should be pregnant for a year.
10.2.5.16.2	The whole year is (the sacrifice).
10.2.5.16.3	The whole is of a hundred kinds.
10.2.5.16.4	By the whole one obtains the whole.
10.2.5.16.5	If one is unable to perform the whole year, one should perform the Viśvajit with the Sarvapṛṣṭha Atiratra.
10.2.5.16.6	In that one should give the whole (to the priests).
10.2.5.16.7	The whole year is the Viśva-jit, the whole is the SarvapṛṢṭha Atiratrā.
10.2.5.16.8	The whole is the whole (to be given to the priests).
10.2.5.16.9	It is of a hundred varieties.
10.2.5.16.10	He obtains all that by means of all.
10.2.6.1.1	Prajapati is the year, consisting of one hundred and one parts.
10.2.6.1.2	Its days and nights, half-months, months, and seasons.
10.2.6.1.3	Sixty are the days and nights of a month.
10.2.6.1.4	The days and nights of the year are obtained in a month.
10.2.6.1.5	Twenty-four are the half-months.
10.2.6.1.6	Thirteen are the months.
10.2.6.1.7	Three are the seasons.
10.2.6.1.8	Those are the hundred kinds.
10.2.6.1.9	The year itself is the hundredth kind.
10.2.6.2.1	It is of seven kinds by the seasons.
10.2.6.2.2	There are six seasons.
10.2.6.2.3	The year is the seventh kind.
10.2.6.2.4	This is the brilliance of this year, that which shines here.
10.2.6.2.5	Its rays are of a hundred kinds.
10.2.6.2.6	A circle is the hundredth type.
10.2.6.4.3	That is indeed his immortality beyond.
10.2.6.4.4	That which is that immortality, that is this light that shines.
10.2.6.5.1	That is this wealth, this variegated radiance.
10.2.6.5.2	That Savitar distributes to the various creatures, to the plants and to the trees.
10.2.6.5.3	He gives more to some and less to others.
10.2.6.5.4	Those to whom he gives more, they live longer; those to whom he gives less, they live less.
10.2.6.6.1	This is said in a verse: "We invoke the distributor of the variegated wealth of Vasu, Savitar, the seer."
10.2.6.6.2	This is all the long life.
10.2.6.6.3	For it is endless.
10.2.6.6.4	What is said here is long, may your life be long. May you live for the whole of your life. This is your world. This is yours.
10.2.6.7.1	Speech speaks while seeing.
10.2.6.7.2	This should be attained by a hundred kinds of means or by a hundred thousand.
10.2.6.7.3	He who arranges a hundred kinds of things or lives for a hundred years, he alone attains immortality.
10.2.6.7.4	Therefore, those who know this and those who do not know this, they say, "The world is a hundred years."
10.2.6.7.5	Therefore, one should not desire to die before one's own time.
10.2.6.7.6	For the world is indeed unknowable.
10.2.6.7.7	Indeed, these are the worlds: day and night, half-months, months, seasons, and the year.
10.2.6.8.1	Those who die within twenty years are reborn in the day and night worlds.
10.2.6.8.2	Those who die within forty years, but beyond twenty years, are reborn in the half-months.
10.2.6.8.3	Those who beyond forty years, but within sixty years, are reborn within the months.
10.2.6.8.4	Those who are beyond sixty years, but within eighty years, are reborn among the seasons.
10.2.6.8.5	Now those who live for more than eighty but less than a hundred years,
10.2.6.8.6	he who lives for a hundred years or more, he alone attains immortality.
10.2.6.9.1	For many sacrifices are measured by one day and one night.
10.2.6.9.2	He who makes a hundred kinds of offerings or lives for a hundred years, he alone attains the highest state.
10.2.6.9.3	He who sustains it for a year makes a hundred kinds.
10.2.6.9.4	Therefore one should build it for a year. This is the deity.
10.2.6.10.1	Now the sacrifice.
10.2.6.10.2	The one hundred men who are measured out by him, each of them is a single kind.
10.2.6.10.3	And he is sevenfold by the layers.
10.2.6.10.4	The layers are sixfold, according to the six seasons.
10.2.6.10.5	Fire is the seventh kind.
10.2.6.11.1	And indeed he is one hundredfold by the bricks.
10.2.6.11.2	The fifty lower bricks and the fifty upper ones make up the hundred kinds.
10.2.6.11.3	Now that which is between the bricks is the hundredth form.
10.2.6.12.1	That is the same Yajus, the hundredfold Yajus.
10.2.6.12.2	The fifty first Yajuses and the fifty last ones are the hundred forms.
10.2.6.12.3	Now that which is between them is the hundredth.
10.2.6.12.4	Thus it becomes of seven kinds and of one hundred kinds.
10.2.6.12.5	He who knows this obtains that which is of one hundred kinds and of seven kinds.
10.2.6.13.1	Thus all the sacrifices are of one hundred kinds, from Agnihotra, through the verses, formulas, words, syllables, rites, and Sāmans.
10.2.6.13.2	He who knows thus, obtains that which is in the hundred-thousand-fold, that which is in a hundred-fold, that in a seven-fold (sacrifice), by means of sacrifice. Thus indeed, he knows the sacrifice.
10.2.6.14.1	Now the inner (sacrifice).
10.2.6.14.2	There are five kinds of fingers, two elbows, the shoulder-blade and the eye.
10.2.6.14.3	That makes twenty-five.
10.2.6.14.4	Thus are the other limbs.
10.2.6.14.5	Those are the hundred kinds.
10.2.6.14.6	The Self alone is the hundred and first kind.
10.2.6.14.7	It has been said for the purpose of the seven kinds.
10.2.6.15.1	He alone is the hundred kinds of Prāṇa-tejas, Prāṇa.
10.2.6.15.2	For Prāṇa is in every limb.
10.2.6.15.3	He who knows him thus, obtains him, who is in the desire of the hundred years, who is in one hundred kinds, who is in seven kinds, who is present in all sacrifices.
10.2.6.15.4	All the sacrifices are completed by the Self.
10.2.6.16.1	There are three kinds of fivefold things: the year, Agni, and the Purusha.
10.2.6.16.2	Their five kinds are food, drink, prosperity, light, and immortality.
10.2.6.16.3	Whatever food there is in the year, that is food.
10.2.6.16.4	Whatever water there is, that is drink.
10.2.6.16.5	Night itself is prosperity.
10.2.6.16.6	All beings dwell together in this night of prosperity.
10.2.6.16.7	The day is light.
10.2.6.16.8	The sun is immortality.
10.2.6.16.9	Thus is the deity.
10.2.6.17.1	Now the sacrifice.
10.2.6.17.2	Whatever food is placed on the fire, that is food.
10.2.6.17.3	Whatever water, that is drink.
10.2.6.17.4	Prosperity is indeed the surrounding.
10.2.6.17.5	That is the form of nights.
10.2.6.17.6	The light is in the Yajurveda.
10.2.6.17.7	For that is the form of the days.
10.2.6.17.8	Fire is the immortal.
10.2.6.17.9	For that is the form (of the sun).
10.2.6.17.10	Thus indeed is the Adhi-yajna.
10.2.6.18.1	Now the Adhyatma.
10.2.6.18.2	Whatever food there is in man, that is food.
10.2.6.18.3	Whatever water there is, that is drink.
10.2.6.18.4	The bones are indeed prosperity.
10.2.6.18.5	For that (is) the form of the encircling (sun).
10.2.6.18.6	The marrow is light.
10.2.6.18.7	That is the form of the Yajus-mantras.
10.2.6.18.8	Breath is immortality.
10.2.6.18.9	That indeed is the form of Agni.
10.2.6.18.10	Breath is Agni.
10.2.6.18.11	Breath indeed is immortality.
10.2.6.18.12	Thus indeed do they say.
10.2.6.19.1	From food one turns away from eating, from drink one turns away from thirst, from prosperity one turns away from sin, from light one turns away from darkness, from immortality one turns away from death.
10.2.6.19.2	For all these things are dependent on him. And he who knows this conquers death and attains the whole of life.
10.2.6.19.3	One should worship it as 'the immortal' in the other world and as 'life' in this world.
10.2.6.19.4	Some worship the breath, saying that the breath is Agni, the breath is the immortal.
10.2.6.19.5	One should not know it thus.
10.2.6.19.6	For the breath is unstable.
10.2.6.19.7	"For that, I bind you with the life-force, not from the middle," for this is said in the Yajus.
10.2.6.19.8	Therefore, one should worship it as immortality in the other world and as life here.
10.2.6.19.9	Thus one attains the entire life.
10.3.1.1.1	The breath is the Gayatri.
10.3.1.1.2	The eye is the Uṣṇik.
10.3.1.1.3	Speech is the Anuṣṭup.
10.3.1.1.4	The mind is the Brihatī.
10.3.1.1.5	The ear is the Paṅkti.
10.3.1.1.6	The one who is the generative breath, that is the Tristup metre.
10.3.1.1.7	And the one who is the downward-moving breath, that is Jagati.
10.3.1.1.8	These are the seven metres, increasing by four, which are performed in the fire.
10.3.1.2.1	Breath is the Gayatri. That is the thousand. This is the greatness of the breath, its power.
10.3.1.2.2	This is the power of the breath.
10.3.1.2.3	If the breath of him who is performing the sacrifice should go out, then this fire would not be sacrificed.
10.3.1.2.4	With this very form, he becomes a thousandfold. This is the Gāyatrī.
10.3.1.3.1	The eye is the Uṣṇīṣa. That is the greatness of the eye, that is the power. This is the thousandfold.
10.3.1.3.2	This is the power of the eye.
10.3.1.3.3	For if the eye of him who is building it were to depart, then this Agni would not be built.
10.3.1.3.4	With this very form of his, he builds a thousand Uṣṇīṣa fires.
10.3.1.4.1	Speech is the Anushtubh verse. This is the greatness of speech, its power, that it is a thousand.
10.3.1.4.2	This is the power of speech.
10.3.1.4.3	For if the speech of one who is building him were to escape, then this Agni would not be built.
10.3.1.4.4	With this very form of it, he is built as a thousand of these Anushtubh verses.
10.3.1.5.1	"The mind is the Brihatī." This is the greatness of the mind, its power, which is this thousand.
10.3.1.5.2	This is the power of the mind.
10.3.1.5.3	For if the mind of one who is building it were to depart, then this Agni would not be built.
10.3.1.5.4	With this very form of it, he builds a thousand Brihatis.
10.3.1.6.1	The ear is the Pancti. Now, the greatness and the power of the ear is this thousand.
10.3.1.6.2	This is the power of the ears.
10.3.1.6.3	For if the ear of him who is building it should depart, then indeed this Agni would not be built.
10.3.1.6.4	With this very form of his, he builds a thousand rows.
10.3.1.7.1	This is the generative breath, this is the Tristubh. This is the greatness of this breath, this is its power, this is the thousand.
10.3.1.7.2	This is the power of this very Prāṇa.
10.3.1.7.3	For if this Prāṇa were to be injured while he is building it, then this Agni would not be built.
10.3.1.7.4	With this very form of his, he is built as a thousand of these Tristubhs.
10.3.1.8.1	Now, this downward-moving breath is the Jagati. This is the greatness of this breath, this is its power, this is the thousand.
10.3.1.8.2	This is the power of this breath.
10.3.1.8.3	For if this breath were to be damaged while they are building it, then this fire would not be built.
10.3.1.8.4	By this very form, he becomes endowed with a thousand worlds.
10.3.1.9.1	These seven metres are established in each other, and these seven breaths in the man are established in each.
10.3.1.9.2	He who recites the collection of metres in this way, his metres are recited, praised or eulogised.
10.3.2.1.1	They say, what is the metre, what is the deity of the head of Agni?
10.3.2.1.2	The metre is Gāyatrī, the deity is Agni, the head.
10.3.2.2.1	What is the metre, which is the deity of neck?

10.3.2.13.3	This is the knowledge of the Self.
10.3.2.13.4	By this one attains these deities and this Self.
10.3.2.13.5	There is no other blessing here than this.
10.3.3.1.1	The wise Shataparnaya approached Mahajala Jabala.
10.3.3.1.2	He said to him, "Why have you approached me, knowing me?"
10.3.3.1.3	He knows Agni.
10.3.3.1.4	Which Agni does he know?
10.3.3.1.5	Speech.
10.3.3.1.6	If one knows that Agni, what does one become?
10.3.3.1.7	One becomes eloquent. Speech does not abandon him.
10.3.3.2.1	He said, "Do you know Agni?" He said, "You who know, please sit down."
10.3.3.2.2	He knows Agni.
10.3.3.2.3	"Which Agni does he knows?"
10.3.3.3.6	He said, "You become wise." He said, "The mind does not leave him."
10.3.3.4.1	He said, "Do you know Agni?" He said, "What do you know about me?" He said,
10.3.3.4.2	"I know Agni."
10.3.3.4.3	He said "Which Agni do you know?"
10.3.3.4.4	He said, "The ear."
10.3.3.4.5	He said, "Who knows that Agni? What does he become?"
10.3.3.4.6	He said, “One becomes one who has ears.” He said, “The ear does not leave him.”
10.3.3.5.1	He said, "Do you know Agni?" He replied, "Yes, I know Agni."
10.3.3.5.2	"Do you know Agni?"
10.3.3.5.3	"Which Agni do you know?"
10.3.3.5.4	"I know the Agni who is all this."
10.3.3.5.5	When he was told this, he climbed down and said, "Teach me that Agni."
10.3.3.6.1	He said, "Indeed, that Agni is the breath.
10.3.3.7.4	That mind is the moon.
10.3.3.7.5	That ear is the directions.
10.3.3.7.6	And that breath is this very wind that blows.
10.3.3.8.1	When Agni follows the wind, then it blows after him.
10.3.3.8.2	Therefore they say, "He follows the wind."
10.3.3.8.3	For he blows after the wind.
10.3.3.8.4	When the sun sets, it enters the wind. The wind enters the moon.
10.3.3.8.5	The directions are established in the wind.
10.3.3.8.6	They are born again from the wind.
10.3.3.8.7	When one who knows this departs from this world, one enters Agni with speech, Aditya with the eye, the moon with the mind, the directions with the ear, and Vayu with the breath.
10.3.3.8.8	Having become of the nature of these, he becomes whatever deity he desires.
10.3.4.1.1	Śvetaketu, son of Haruṇi, was about to perform a sacrifice.
10.3.4.1.2	His father said to him, "Which priests will you have for the sake of the sacrifice?"
10.3.4.1.3	He said, "This very one, my own Vaiśvānara, will be the Hotṛ."
10.3.4.1.4	He asked him, "Do you know, O Brāhmaṇa, the Vaiśvānaran?
10.3.4.2.1	The four great ones.
10.3.4.2.2	He said, "I know."
10.3.4.2.3	Do you know the four great ones of the great ones?
10.3.4.2.4	He said, “I know.”
10.3.4.2.5	Do you know four vows?
10.3.4.2.6	He said “I know.” 
10.3.4.2.7	Do you know what are the four vows of the vows?
10.3.4.2.8	He replied, “I know”.
10.3.4.3.2-10	Then he said, "You will tell us." "Do you know the leaves of the sun?" "Then he said, 'You will tell us.'" "Do you understand the flowers of the sun?" Then he said, 'Do you understand the sheath of the sun?' "Then he asked, 'Do you know the seeds of the sun?'" "Then he inquired, 'Do you comprehend the sun's seeds?'" "He then asked, 'Do the seeds of the Sun exist?'" "Do you comprehend the seeds of the Suṇ?"
10.3.4.3.11	Do you know the root of the sun?
10.3.4.3.12	He said, "You will tell us."
10.3.4.3.13	Do you know the base of the sun? He said, "You know."
10.3.4.3.14	He said, “You will tell us.”
10.3.4.3.15	Do you know about the root of the Sun?
10.3.4.3.16	He said "You will tell."
10.3.4.4.1-7	He said, "Do you know the four great things and the four great things of the great?" Agni is great. Of that great one, the great ones are plants and trees. For that is its food. Wind is great. Of that great one, water is great. For that indeed is its food. The sun is great. The moon is great of that great one.
10.3.4.4.8	For that is its food.
10.3.4.4.9	The Purusha is great.
10.3.4.4.10	Of that great one, the great animals are great.
10.3.4.4.11	For that is its food
10.3.4.4.12	These four are great.
10.3.4.4.13	These four are the great of the great.
10.3.4.4.14	These are the four vows.
10.3.4.4.15	These are of the four vows. The vows.
10.3.4.4.16	These four alone are the Kya.
10.3.4.5.4-8	You know the two chambers of the sun, that is, the nostrils. He said this. You know the two sprouts of the sun, i.e., the lips. He said this.
10.3.4.5.9	This Agni, this Sun, is the Person.
10.3.4.5.10	He who worships this Agni, this Sun as the Person, as 'I am Agni, I am the Sun', by knowledge this Agni, this sun, is indeed deposited in his Self.
10.3.5.1.1	This indeed is the Yajus, this which blows here.
10.3.5.1.2	For this indeed generates all this.
10.3.5.2.6	This is the Yajus established in the Rks and Sāmans.
10.3.5.2.7	The Rks and Sāmans carry it.
10.3.5.2.8	Therefore the Adhvaryu performs the rite with the same Grahas.
10.3.5.2.9	The Stut and Sastra are different.
10.3.5.2.10	It is like running with the former ones after the latter ones.
10.3.5.3.1	Agni is in front.
10.3.5.3.2	For these creatures worship Agni as their leader.
10.3.5.3.3	The sun is the feet.
10.3.5.3.4	For when the sun rises, then all this moves.
10.3.5.3.5	This is the mantra with its preliminary rites, as to the deity.
10.3.5.4.1	Now as to the inner self.
10.3.5.4.2	The breath is the mantra.
10.3.5.4.3	For the breath generates all this.
10.3.5.4.4	This world follows the moving breath.
10.3.5.4.5	Therefore, the Yajus is indeed the breath.
10.3.5.5.1	This very space is the Yajus, which is the space within the self.
10.3.5.5.2	For it moves in accordance with this space.
10.3.5.5.3	This Yajus is the breath, space, and the Yajus.
10.3.5.5.4	Therefore, it is the Yajas.
10.3.5.5.5	The Yajus is verily the breath.
10.3.5.5.6	For the breath moves.
10.3.5.6.1	Food itself is the Yajus.
10.3.5.6.2	For food is born.
10.3.5.6.3	Food moves.
10.3.5.6.4	This Yajus is established in food.
10.3.5.6.5	Food carries.
10.3.5.6.6	Therefore, in the same breath, different kinds of food are placed.
10.3.5.7.1	The mind itself is the front.
10.3.5.7.2	For the mind is the first of the breaths.
10.3.5.7.3	The eye itself is the foot.
10.3.5.7.4	The Self indeed moves through the eye.
10.3.5.7.5	This Yajus, along with its preliminary rites, is established in the deity and in the Self.
10.3.5.7.6	He who indeed knows this Yajus, with its preliminary rites and established in the deity as well as in the Self,
10.3.5.8.1	becomes free from misfortune and distress, and attains the goal of the sacrifice.
10.3.5.8.2	He who knows this becomes the best of his own, the leader, the nourisher, the lord.
10.3.5.9.1	He who knows this and desires to be the foremost among his own, does not become a burden to his wives.
10.3.5.9.2	He who experiences this and desires to become the foremost among his wives, becomes a burden to his wife.
10.3.5.10.1	This is the highest Brahman.
10.3.5.10.2	For there is nothing greater than this.
10.3.5.10.3	He who knows this becomes the best and most excellent of his kinsmen.
10.3.5.11.1	This indeed is the Brahman, the foremost, the supreme.
10.3.5.11.2	He who thus knows this Brahman, the foremost and supreme, becomes the best and supreme among his equals.
10.3.5.11.3	The better ones are born from him.
10.3.5.11.4	Therefore, one who wishes to be superior to him should worship the directions as being prior to him.
10.3.5.11.5	Then he does not harm him.
10.3.5.12.1	The essence of this mantra is the Upanishad.
10.3.5.12.2	Therefore, the Adhvaryu takes up the cup of Soma with a formula of just that much extent, and he enjoys both the praise and the hymn. He enjoys both the praise hymn.
10.3.5.12.3	Therefore, the juice of food is just that much in extent, and it nourishes all food, and it enjoys all food.
10.3.5.13.1	Satisfaction is his destination.
10.3.5.13.2	Therefore, when he is satisfied with food, then he thinks that he has gone.
10.3.5.13.3	The bliss itself is his consciousness, the Self.
10.3.5.13.4	All the gods are indeed blissful-souled.
10.3.5.13.5	This indeed is the knowledge of the gods.
10.3.5.13.6	He who knows this is indeed not a human being.
10.3.5.13.7	He is indeed one with the gods.
10.3.5.14.1	Now, indeed, he who knew this, Priyavrata Rauhinayana, said to the wind blowing, "The wind is the Self, whether it is blowing or not."
10.3.5.14.2	It indeed blows in that way.
10.3.5.14.3	Therefore, one who desires a blessing among the gods should approach with this alone: "The Self is indeed Ananda, may that desire of mine be fulfilled."
10.3.5.14.4	The desire that he has in his mind is fulfilled.
10.3.5.14.5	He who knows this attains the satisfaction, the goal, the bliss, the self.
10.3.5.15.1	This is the mantra of the Upanishad, which is not explained.
10.3.5.15.2	The mantra is indeed the breath.
10.3.5.15.3	The breath is the support of the Upanisad.
10.3.5.15.4	If someone were to say to him, "You have mentioned a deity without mentioning its name. The vital breath will leave you," it would be so.
10.3.5.16.1	He who knows the manifestation of the named deity manifests with fame and glory.
10.3.5.16.2	The Adhvaryu takes up the Soma-graha in a low voice, reciting the Yajus.
10.3.5.16.3	Having taken it up, he manifests.
10.3.5.16.4	He builds the fire with the Upamsu-formula.
10.3.5.16.5	The built and the piled up fire becomes manifest.
10.3.5.16.6	He offers the oblation with the Upamshu-formula.
10.3.5.16.7	It becomes cooked and settled.
10.3.5.16.8	Whatever he does with the Upamśu-formula, it becomes done and settled.
10.3.5.16.9	He who knows this well-defined manifestation becomes manifest with fame, glory and brilliance.
10.3.5.16.10	He quickly goes to the other world.
10.3.5.16.11	He becomes a Yajus.
10.3.5.16.12	They call him a Yajus
10.4.1.1.1	When Prajapati was scattered, the gods collected him, and they poured him into the womb of the cauldron, in the form of semen.
10.4.1.1.2	The womb is the cauldron.
10.4.1.1.3	From that they collected food in this year, which is this fire that is built.
10.4.1.1.4	They placed it on themselves.
10.4.1.1.5	It became the self when placed on themselves.
10.4.1.1.6	Therefore, when food is placed on oneself, it becomes the self.
10.4.1.2.1	In the same way, the sacrificer pours himself as semen into the womb of the pot.
10.4.1.2.2	The pot is indeed the womb.
10.4.1.2.3	Therefore, he makes the food ready in a year in this fire which is built.
10.4.1.3.4	Whatever food is equal to the self, that sustains it and does not harm it.
10.4.1.3.5	Whatever is more, that harms it; whatever is less, that does not sustain it.
10.4.1.4.1	This very Agni is the Sun, whom they bring here.
10.4.1.4.2	This is its food, which is this Agni that is being built.
10.4.1.4.3	It is the Arka, the Yajus.
10.4.1.4.4	This is the great one.
10.4.1.4.5	This is his food, his vow.
10.4.1.4.6	This is the great vow, from the Sama Veda.
10.4.1.4.7	This is indeed the Uktha.
10.4.1.4.8	This is his food, the Thana.
10.4.1.4.9	This is Uktha, from the Rig Veda.
10.4.1.4.10	This one thing is called in three ways.
10.4.1.5.1	Then Indra and Agni were created, Brahman and Kshatra.
10.4.1.5.2	Agni is indeed Brahman, Indra is Kshatra.
10.4.1.5.3	Those two did not become created.
10.4.1.5.4	They said, "We are not able to create offspring in this way."
10.4.1.5.5	"One form, both of us."
10.4.1.5.6	They became one form, both of them.
10.4.1.6.1	Those two who were Indra and Agni, they are these two, gold and man.
10.4.1.6.2	Gold is Indra, man is Agni.
10.4.1.7.4	Whatever is cooked by fire, that is Agni.
10.4.1.7.5	And what is excrement, that is Indra.
10.4.1.7.6	Therefore they do not cook it with fire.
10.4.1.7.7	So that Agni and Indra are not the same.
10.4.1.7.8	Therefore these two, Indra and Agni, are in the fire-altar.
10.4.1.8.1	And whatever Agni is deposited in the fire-altat, that is one form and both become.
10.4.1.8.2	Therefore, these two (gods) generate these beings in that very form.
10.4.1.8.3	This is the same brick Agni.
10.4.1.8.4	All Agni comes together in it.
10.4.1.8.5	This is indeed the abundance of bricks.
10.4.1.8.6	This is only one syllable, 'vau'.
10.4.1.8.7	All Agni comes to it.
10.4.1.8.8	This indeed is the abundance of syllables.
10.4.1.9.1	Seeing this, the Rishi recited the truth. I praise the great Brahman, the one syllable, the many Brahman, the one-syllable.
10.4.1.9.2	For this indeed is the syllable in which all the gods and all beings are merged.
10.4.1.9.3	This is indeed Brahman and Kshatra.
10.4.1.9.4	Agni is indeed Brahman, Indra is Kshatra.
10.4.1.9.5	Indra and Agni are the All-gods.
10.4.1.9.6	The All-gods are the Vidyas.
10.4.1.9.7	This is indeed the Brahman, the Kshatra, the Vidyas;
10.4.1.10.1	Now this was known by Shyaparna Sayakayana, who said: "If this my work had been accomplished, then my subjects would have been the kings, my Brahmanas, my Vaishyas.
10.4.1.10.2	But if I do not have enough of this rite, then I will be blessed with both kinds of progeny."
10.4.1.10.3	This indeed is glory, this is fame, this is the one who nourishes.
10.4.1.11.1	This indeed was said by Chandilya to Vamakakshayanya: "You will be glorious, famous, and the one who nourlishes."
10.4.1.11.2	One who knows this becomes glorious, famous, the one who nourisher.
10.4.1.12.1	This Agni is indeed Prajapati.
10.4.1.12.2	The gods, having performed this Agni, Prajapati, then offered him food in this year, namely the Mahavrata cup.
10.4.1.13.1	The Adhvaryu takes it with the cup.
10.4.1.13.2	Because he takes it, therefore it is called a cup.
10.4.1.13.3	In it the Udgata puts the essence with the Mahavrata.
10.4.1.13.4	All these are the same as the Great Vrata.
10.4.1.13.5	In this he places the essence of all the Sama hymns.
10.4.1.13.6	In this the Hotṛ places the essence with the Great Utktha.
10.4.1.13.7	All these are the same verses as the Great Utkha.
10.4.1.13.8	In this, he places the essence with all the verses.
10.4.1.14.1	When they praise him and when he recites the Anushtubh verse, then he offers this oblation at the Vasat-call.
10.4.1.14.2	"This is indeed the fire, and this is the six-fold food."
10.4.1.14.3	Having made it equal to his own body, he puts it down.
10.4.1.14.4	Whatever food is equal to one's own body, that sustains one and does not harm one.
10.4.1.14.5	Whatever is more, that harms one; whatever is less, that does not sustain one.
10.4.1.15.1	This very Agni is the Sun.
10.4.1.15.2	This is his food, the Kyam. This is the great Vratya Graha.
10.4.1.15.3	This is the Arkyam, according to the Yajur Veda.
10.4.1.15.4	This is indeed the great one.
10.4.1.15.5	This is its food, the Vratam.
10.4.1.15.6	This is called the Mahavrata, according to the Sama Veda.
10.4.1.15.7	This very one is the Uk.
10.4.1.15.8	This is food, the Thas.
10.4.1.15.9	This is Uktham, according to the Rig Veda.
10.4.1.15.10	This one truth is spoken of as three.
10.4.1.16.1	This year, Prajapati, Agni,
10.4.1.16.2	Half of it is Savitri, half is Vaishvakarman.
10.4.1.16.3	There are eight Savitri and eight Vaishvakarmana.
10.4.1.16.4	And what is done in between is the seventeen Prajapati himself.
10.4.1.16.5	The syllable that is among men, that is the syllable among the gods.
10.4.1.17.1	That is called "skin," two syllables, "blood," two syllables, fat, two syllables, flesh, two syllables, "fat," two syllables, bone, two syllables, marrow, two syllables.
10.4.1.17.2	Those are the sixteen syllables.
10.4.1.17.3	Now that which moves between them is indeed the seventeenth Prajapati.
10.4.1.18.1	Therefore, for this vital breath, these sixteen parts of food are brought.
10.4.1.18.2	When they are unable to bring them, then having eaten them, he goes out.
10.4.1.18.3	Therefore, when one is not able to eat, one becomes like a corpse, with the vital breaths being withdrawn.
10.4.1.18.4	Therefore, one becomes like one who is emaciated by disease.
10.4.1.18.5	For he is eaten by the vital airs.
10.4.1.19.1	Therefore, for this Prajapati, who is seventeen, they have arranged this food which is seventeen, namely, this Soma sacrifice which is seventeen.
10.4.1.19.2	And those sixteen parts of his are these sixteen priests.
10.4.1.19.3	Therefore one should not make a seventeenth priest, lest he should exceed.
10.4.1.19.4	Now, whatever is the essence here, and whatever oblations are offered, that is the seventeenth kind of food.
10.4.1.20.1	When they praise him and when he recites the Anushtubh verse, then he offers this into it at the Vasat-call.
10.4.1.20.2	"This is indeed the fire, and this is the six-fold food."
10.4.1.20.3	Having made it equal to his own body, he places it.
10.4.1.20.4	Whatever food is equal to the self, that sustains it and does not harm it.
10.4.1.20.5	What is more than that harms it.
10.4.1.20.6	What less than that does not sustain it.
10.4.1.21.1	This very Agni is the Sun.
10.4.1.21.2	His food is this, the Soma-rite is this.
10.4.1.21.3	This is the Arky (rite), the Yajus (rite).
10.4.1.21.4	This is the great one.
10.4.1.21.5	This is his food, his vow.
10.4.1.21.6	This is the great vow, from the Sama Veda.
10.4.1.21.7	This is indeed the Uktha.
10.4.1.21.8	This is his food, the Thana.
10.4.1.21.9	This is Uktha, from the Rig Veda.
10.4.1.21.10	This one thing is called in three ways.
10.4.1.21.11	With this food he ascended upwards.
10.4.1.21.12	He who ascended is the sun.
10.4.1.21.13	Then he went forth with that food. That is the moon.
10.4.1.22.1	That very same is the sun, which shines.
10.4.1.22.2	That is his food, the Kya. That is the Moon.
10.4.1.22.3	That is the Arky, from the Yajus.
10.4.1.22.4	That very one is the Great One.
10.4.1.22.5	That is its food, the Vrata.
10.4.1.22.6	That is Mahavrata, from the Sama.
10.4.1.22.7	That very is the Uk.
10.4.1.22.8	That is it food, the Thas.
10.4.1.22.9	That is the Uktha of the Rk.
10.4.1.22.10	That one, indeed, is called in three ways.
10.4.1.22.11	Thus is the Adhidevata.
10.4.1.23.1	Now the Adhyatma.
10.4.1.23.2	The breath is indeed the Arka.
10.4.1.23.3	Its food is indeed the Kyam.
10.4.1.23.4	That is the Arkya of the Yajus.
10.4.1.23.5	The breath itself is the Great.
10.4.1.23.6	Its food itself is the Vrata.
10.4.1.23.7	That is Mahāvratam of the Sama.
10.4.1.23.8	The breath indeed is the Uk.
10.4.1.23.9	His food is indeed the truth.
10.4.1.23.10	That is the praise, the Rk.
10.4.1.23.11	That one, indeed, is called in three ways.
10.4.1.23.12	This is the same, indeed, the divine, and this is the inner.
10.4.2.1.1	Prajapati is indeed the year, Agni, Soma, the king, and the moon.
10.4.2.1.2	He himself declared to Yajnavacasa, the son of Rajastambha, "As many as are the luminaries, so many are my bricks."
10.4.2.2.1	Now, this year of Prajapati has seven hundred and twenty days and nights, which are the bricks. There are sixty-three hundred Parashritas, and sixty-three hundred Yajusmatis.
10.4.2.2.2	This year, Prajapati, created all beings, both those with life and those without life, both gods and men.
10.4.2.2.3	Having created all beings, he thought, "I am alone."
10.4.2.2.4	He feared death.
10.4.2.3.1	He thought, "How can I again throw these beings into myself, how can I again place them in myself?"
10.4.2.3.2	"How can I again be the self of all these beings?"
10.4.2.4.1	He divided himself into two.
10.4.2.4.2	The bricks of one were sixty-three hundred, and of the other sixty-three hundred.
10.4.2.4.3	He did not cover it.
10.4.2.5.1	He made three (kinds of) bricks for himself.
10.4.2.5.2	There were three hundred and eighty bricks for each (kind).
10.4.2.5.3	He did not cover it even.
10.4.2.6.1	He made four (kinds of) himself. There were four hundred bricks for each ( kind).
10.4.2.6.2	He did cover it.
10.4.2.7.1	(But) he made five (kinds of) for himself.
10.4.2.7.2	Each (kind) had forty-four hundred bricks.
10.4.2.7.3	He did not cover it.
10.4.2.8.1	Six created twenty hundred bricks.
10.4.2.8.2	He did not cover it either.
10.4.2.8.3	It did not become sevenfold.
10.4.2.9.1	Eight created ninety bricks.
10.4.2.9.2	He also did not cover it
10.4.2.10.1	Nine created eighty bricks.
10.4.2.10.2	He too did not cover it.
10.4.2.11.1	The ten-souled ones made twenty-seven bricks.
10.4.2.11.2	He did not cover (the altar).
10.4.2.11.3	It did not become elevenfold.
10.4.2.12.1	The twelve-souled ones (made) sixty bricks.
10.4.2.12.2	He also did not cover (it).
10.4.2.12.3	It did neither become thirteenfold nor fourteenfold.
10.4.2.13.1	The fifteen-souled ones make forty-eight bricks.
10.4.2.16.1	He made twenty-one parts of himself, thirty-six bricks.
10.4.2.16.2	He did not cover it.
10.4.2.16.3	It did not become twenty-one-fold, nor twenty-two-fold, nor twent-three-fold.
10.4.2.17.1	He made twenty-four parts of himself, and thirty bricks.
10.4.2.17.2	He stood in the fifteenth array.
10.4.2.17.3	Because he stood in the fifteenfold array, therefore the fifteen forms of the moon are filled up and fifteen forms are diminished.
10.4.2.18.1	And because he made himself twenty-four, therefore the year consists of twenty-four half-months.
10.4.2.18.2	He did not perish with these twenty-four forms of himself.
10.4.2.18.3	He saw the fifteen forms of his body in fifteen hours, and the fifteen hours of the night.
10.4.2.18.4	Because they protect for a short time, they are called Muhurtas.
10.4.2.18.5	And because they are small and fill these worlds, they are called Lokampranas.
10.4.2.19.1	This indeed cooks all this by day and night, by half-months, months, seasons and by the year.
10.4.2.19.2	This one cooks what is cooked by that.
10.4.2.19.3	Bharadvaja said, "What is cooked by that is cooked by this one," for this one cooks what is already cooked by that. The number of days in a year is 365.
10.4.2.20.1	They came to be ten thousand eight hundred.
10.4.2.20.2	He remained there for ten thousand and eight hundred.
10.4.2.21.1	Then he looked at all the beings.
10.4.2.21.2	He saw all the beings in the three Vedas.
10.4.2.21.3	Herein is the self of all the metres, all the stomas, all the vital airs, and all the gods.
10.4.2.21.4	This indeed exists.
10.4.2.21.5	For this is the immortal.
10.4.2.21.6	What is immortal, that exists.
10.4.2.21.7	This is what is mortal.
10.4.2.22.1	Prajapati thought, "All beings are indeed in the three Vedas.
10.4.2.22.2	Let me create myself in the form of the three Vedas."
10.4.2.23.1	He arranged the verses, twelve thousand in number, in the Brihatī metre,
10.4.2.23.2	These are the number of the Hārcis created by Prajapati.
10.4.2.23.3	They stood in the thirty-third array in rows.
10.4.2.23.4	Because they stood in the thirtythird array, therefore there are thirty nights in a month.
10.4.2.23.5	And because they stood in rows, therefore Prajapati is fivefold.
10.4.2.23.6	There were eight hundred rows.
10.4.2.24.1	Then he arranged the other two Vedas, twelve thousand Brihatis each, eight of the Yajurveda and four of the Samaveda.
10.4.2.24.2	So much of these two Vedas was created by Prajapati.
10.4.2.24.3	They stood in the thirty-first arrangement in the rows.
10.4.2.24.4	Because they stood in the thirty-third division, therefore there are thirty nights in a month.
10.4.2.24.5	And because they were in the rows, therefore Prajapati is fivefold.
10.4.2.24.6	Those rows became eight hundred.
10.4.2.25.1	All those three Vedas, ten thousand and eight hundred, became eight hundred.
10.4.2.25.2	He attained eighty in a moment.
10.4.2.25.3	In a moment he attained eighty.
10.4.2.26.1	He sprinkled himself in the womb of the three worlds, which is the form of the Vedas, the form of praise, the form of life, and the form of the deities.
10.4.2.26.2	In the first half of the month, the first self was cremated; in the second half, the second self; in the third half, the third self.
10.4.2.26.3	In the year itself, the entire self was cremated.
10.4.2.27.1	What he placed around it, that he placed as night; after that, fifteen Muhurtas; after the Muhurtas, fifteen Aashtis.
10.4.2.27.2	Then he placed the Yajus-containing (verse). He placed it on that day. After that fifteen Muhurtas (of time), after that fifteen Muhurtasa (of time), fifteen Aashitas (of time).
10.4.2.27.3	Thus they placed this threefold knowledge in themselves, in their own selves.
10.4.2.27.4	He became the Self of all beings here, consisting of Chanda, consisting of Stoma, consisting of Praana, consisting of Devatas.
10.4.2.27.5	Having become of the nature of this (fire), he ascended upwards.
10.4.2.27.6	He who ascended, that is the moon.
10.4.2.28.1	His support is this (sun) which shines.
10.4.2.28.2	From this (moon) it was recited, it was recited in this (sun).
10.4.2.28.3	He then created him from himself, he generated him from himself.
10.4.2.29.1	When he is about to perform the Agnihotra, he consecrates himself. Just as Prajapati deposited his own self in the form of semen in the womb of the three worlds, so does he now deposit his own self in that form in the womb of fire.
10.4.2.29.2	In the first half of the month, the first Self is purified; in the second half, the second; in the third half, the third.
10.4.2.29.3	In the year, the entire Self is purified.
10.4.2.30.1	What he places in the enclosure, that he places in the night; after that, fifteen Muhurtas; after that, the fifteen hundred Muhurtas.
10.4.2.30.2	Then when he places the Yajus-containing (bricks), he places them on that day. After that, fifteen Muhurtas (of time). After the Muhurtas, fifteen hundred (bricks).
10.4.2.30.3	Thus he places in himself this threefold knowledge. He makes it his own.
10.4.2.30.4	Herein he becomes the Self of all beings, consisting of metres, consisting of Stoma, consisting of Prāṇa, consisting of deities.
10.4.2.30.5	Having become of the nature of this (fire), he ascends upwards.
10.4.2.31.1	This is his support, who shines here.
10.4.2.31.2	From this (fire) he is born, in this (fire) is he born.
10.4.2.31.3	He creates him from himself, he generates him from himself.
10.4.2.31.4	When he departs from this world, knowing thus, then he is born again in this very self, which is composed of the Vedas, composed of the vital airs, composed of the deities.
10.4.2.31.5	Having become composed of this alone, he ascends upwards. He who, knowing thus, performs this rite, he who knows this thus,
10.4.3.1.1	This indeed is death, namely, the year.
10.4.3.1.2	For this indeed, the day and night, consumes the life of mortals.
10.4.3.1.3	And they die.
10.4.3.1.4	Therefore this is indeed death.
10.4.3.1.5	But he who knows this death as a year, his life is not consumed by the day and night before old age.
10.4.3.1.6	He indeed attains the whole span of life.
10.4.3.2.1	This indeed is the end.
10.4.3.2.2	For this is the end of the life of mortals.
10.4.3.2.3	And they die.
10.4.3.2.4	Therefore he is the end.
10.4.3.2.5	He who knows this end, death, as the year, does not reach the end of his life before old age.
10.4.3.2.6	He attains all his life.
10.4.3.3.1	Those gods, fearing from this year of death, the lord of creation, thought, "May he not reach the end of our life through day and night."
10.4.3.4.1	They instituted these sacrificial rites: Agnihotra, Darsha-Pūrnamāsa, Cāturmāsya, Pasubandha, and Soma sacrifice.
10.4.3.4.2	Those who performed these sacrificial rites attained immortality.
10.4.3.5.1	They then built a fire altar.
10.4.3.5.2	They placed the bricks in an unlimited number, the Yajus verses in an unlimited number and the Lokamprinas in an unlimited number. The gods did this so that even now one could place them in an unlimited number."
10.4.3.5.3	They did not attain immortality.
10.4.3.6.1	They, worshipping and striving, sought immortality, but they did not attain it.
10.4.3.6.2	Prajapati said to them, "You have not placed all my forms."
10.4.3.6.3	You have indeed gone beyond and have not attained them.
10.4.3.6.4	Therefore you have not become immortal."
10.4.3.7.1	They said, "You yourself tell us how we can place all your forms."
10.4.3.8.1	He said, "He should place sixty-three hundred verses, sixty-three hundred mantras."
10.4.3.8.2	Then he placed thirty-six, then Lokamprana, ten thousand and eight hundred.
10.4.3.8.3	Then he said, "You will place all the forms."
10.4.3.8.4	Then you will become immortal."
10.4.3.8.5	The gods placed them thus.
10.4.3.8.6	Then the gods became immortal.
10.4.3.9.1	Death said to the gods, "In this way all men will become immortal."
10.4.3.9.2	"Then who will be my share?"
10.4.3.9.3	They said, "There is no one else who is immortal with the body.
10.4.3.9.4	When you took this share, then you turned away from the body and became immortal. Whether one becomes immortal through knowledge or through action,
10.4.3.9.5	they said, "Is it through knowledge or through actions?" This is indeed that knowledge, namely Agni.
10.4.3.9.6	This is indeed that action, namely Agni.
10.4.3.10.1	Those who know this, and those who perform this rite, are reborn after death.
10.4.3.10.2	Those who are reborn attain immortality.
10.4.3.10.3	But those who do not know this, and do not perform this rite, they are reborn after death,
10.4.3.10.4	and again and again they become the food of this one.
10.4.3.11.1	When he builds the fire, he thereby attains the fire of Prajapati, the year, the death, the end, which the gods attained. He places it (in the fire-place) in the same way as the gods placed it.
10.4.3.12.1	He attains the nights by the Parisrita verses, the days by the Yajus verses, the half-months, months, seasons, the worlds by the Lokamprana verses, the Muhurtas.
10.4.3.13.1	Those who are the Parisrita, the night-worlds, they are made the servants of the nights, they are the image of the nights.
10.4.3.13.2	They are sixty-three hundred.
10.4.3.13.3	And there are sixty-three hundred nights in a year.
10.4.3.13.4	Of these, twenty-one are deposited in the Garhapatya, eighty-two in the Dhishnyas, and two hundred and sixty in the Ahavaniya.
10.4.3.14.1	Now the Yajus-verses.
10.4.3.14.2	The darbha-bunch, the bricks, the lotus-leaf, the golden man, the two ladles, the self-born, the durva-grass, the bricks, two verses, the two semen-seeders, the All-Light, the Rtavya, the Ashada, the tortoise, the mortar and pestle, the cauldron, the five animal heads, the fifteen Apasyas, the five Chhandasya, the fifty Pranabhrats, they are two hundred. The first layer is the first.
10.4.3.15.1	Now the second (layer).
10.4.3.15.2	There are five Asvinis, two Ritavyas, five Vaishvadevyas, five Pranabharts, five Apasyas, and one Vyasya.
10.4.3.15.3	They are forty-one, and the second layer.
10.4.3.16.1	Now the third (layer).
10.4.3.16.2	The five Svayambhuva, the four Vishva-jyoti, the ten Pranabhrata, the thirty-six Chandasya, and the fourteen Valakhilya.
10.4.3.16.3	They are seventy-one, the third layer.
10.4.3.17.1	Now the fourth.
10.4.3.17.2	Eighteen in the first, then twelve, then seventeen.
10.4.3.17.3	They are forty-seven, the fourth layer.
10.4.3.18.1	Now the fifth.
10.4.3.18.2	The five Asapatna, the forty Viraj, the thirty-one Stomabhaga, the five Nakasada, the five Panchuchuda, the thirty-three Chandasya, the eight Garhapatya, the eight Punachiti, the Rtavyas, the Vishvajyoti, the Vikarni, the Svayamaatrina, the Asma Prsni, and the Agni who is deposited in the Cit.
10.4.3.18.3	Those are the thirty-eight hundred and five layers of bricks.
10.4.3.19.1	All of them are five times four hundred.
10.4.3.19.2	Then those sixty-three hundred are the days, and they are made into the seven days of the days, the image of the days.
10.4.3.19.3	Those are sixty-three hundred.
10.4.3.19.4	And there are sixty-three hundred days in a year.
10.4.3.19.5	And the thirty-six days which are the excrement, they are the thirty-six.
10.4.3.19.6	Then the twenty-four days which are the world of half-months, they are made the half-months, and the half-months are the image of the half-months.
10.4.3.19.7	Then the twelve months are made the Sapti of the months, and the months are the image of the months.
10.4.3.19.8	They are two by two, the worlds of the seasons, for the non-emptiness of the seasons.
10.4.3.20.1	Then the worlds of the Muhurtas are made the Saptis of the Muhurtus, and the Muhurtus are the image of Muhurtus.
10.4.3.20.2	They are ten thousand eight hundred.
10.4.3.20.3	For there are as many Muhurtas in a year.
10.4.3.20.4	Of these, twenty-one are placed on the Garhapatya, eighty-two on the Dhiṣṇyas, and the rest on the Āhavanīya.
10.4.3.20.5	For there are as many forms of the year.
10.4.3.20.6	They are placed here as the year's forms.
10.4.3.21.1-5	Now some people think that one should place this (fire) in the Ahavaniya itself, while others think that these fires are to be placed elsewhere. "One should not do so. He builds ten fires, eight Dhishnya fires, the Ahavaniya and the Garhapatya." Therefore they say, "Agni is Viraj."
10.4.3.21.6	The Viraj has ten syllables.
10.4.3.21.7	They call all of them by the name Agni.
10.4.3.21.8	For all these forms belong to him.
10.4.3.21.9	Just as the days, half-months, months and seasons belong to the year, so do all these forms belong (to Agni).
10.4.3.22.1	Those who do so, they make these forms of his external, and then they make him a sinner. For the caste, for the people, for the caste, for each other, for the opposite, for the opposite.
10.4.3.22.2	He places a spotted stone on the Agnidhra-brick.
10.4.3.22.3	Then he sees it.
10.4.3.22.4	Why, seeing that, should he not see the others?
10.4.3.22.5	By which he drives away evil, that is the eleventh.
10.4.3.23.1	They say, "How does he not see them here?"
10.4.3.23.2	For he does not offer them.
10.4.3.23.3	For the brick is made complete by the offering.
10.4.3.24.1	They say: "How are these bricks not excessive when offered?"
10.4.3.24.2	These are his power.
10.4.3.24.3	The man is not different from the power.
10.4.3.24.4	He who, knowing this, performs this rite, he indeed makes this entire Prajapati complete. He who knows this thus,
10.4.4.1.1	Prajapati, creating the beings, was attacked by sin and death.
10.4.4.1.2	He performed austerities for a thousand years, desiring to conquer sin.
10.4.4.2.1	When he was performing austerities, the luminaries rose above those pits of hair.
10.4.4.2.2	Those luminaries are the stars.
10.4.4.2.3	There are as many stars as there are pits of hair. 
10.4.4.2.4	There are as much as there are pits, so many moments in a thousand-year day.
10.4.4.3.1	He who is the one who blows in the thousandth year, he blows away all.
10.4.4.3.2	He who blows away in the thousandth, he is this wind that blows here.
10.4.4.3.3	And that which he blows away as evil, that is this body.
10.4.4.3.4	Who is that man who would endure the thousand years?
10.4.4.3.5	One who knows thus, indeed, endures the thousand years by knowledge.
10.4.4.4.1	All these bricks should be worshipped with a thousand oblations.
10.4.4.4.2	He should worship the one that is completed by one thousand nights, by one thousand nights. He should worship the day that is completed by a thousand days, by a thousand days. He should worship one that is completed in half a month, by half a month. He should worship that which is completed in a month, by a month. He worship that which is complete in a season, by a season. He should worship a Muhurta that is completed in a Muhurta, by a Muhurta. He should worship Samvatsara that is completed in Samvatsara, by Samvatsara.
10.4.4.4.3	Those who know this Agni as completed in a year, they know the thousandth part of it.
10.4.4.4.4	But those who do not know it thus, they do not know even the thousandth part.
10.4.4.4.5	Now he who knows thus, and he who performs this rite, he indeed attains this entire Agni of Prajapati, which Prajapati attained.
10.4.4.4.6	Therefore one who knows thus should indeed perform austerities.
10.4.4.4.7	For if one who knows thus performs austerities, then all that belongs to him becomes heaven-bound.
10.4.4.5.1	This is said in a verse: "Whatever the gods know, that is not false."
10.4.4.5.2	For one who knows thus, nothing is false.
10.4.4.5.3	Thus all the gods know this.
10.4.5.1.1	Now the Upaniṣads of the regions.
10.4.5.1.2	The Śākaṭāyanins meditate on Vāyu as Agni.
10.4.5.1.3	Some say that Āditya is Agni.
10.4.5.1.4	Then indeed the Halīṅgas or the Śraumatys said, "The wind is indeed the fire."
10.4.5.1.5	Therefore, when the Adhvaryu performs the last rite, then he also goes to this (fire).
10.4.5.2.1	Śāṭyāyanī said, "The year is indeed the fire.
10.4.5.2.2	Its head is spring.
10.4.5.2.3	Summer is the right wing, the rainy season is the left wing.
10.4.5.2.4	Autumn is the middle body.
10.4.5.2.5	The two seasons of winter and spring are the tail, the support.
10.4.5.2.6	Speech is Agni.
10.4.5.2.7	Breath is Vayu.
10.4.5.2.8	The eye is Aditya.
10.4.5.2.9	The mind is the moon.
10.4.5.2.10	The ear is the directions.
10.4.5.2.11	Water is the pair.
10.4.5.2.12	Penance is the support.
10.4.5.2.13	The months are the festivals.
10.4.5.2.14	The half-months are the channels.
10.4.5.2.15	The days and nights are the silver and gold leaves.
10.4.5.2.16	Thus he goes to the gods.
10.4.5.2.17	One should know that the year is Agni.
10.4.5.2.18	One should indeed know that one becomes of this nature.
10.4.5.3.1	Śāṇḍilīyana Chhilaka said: These worlds are the three layers of the altar, spread out by themselves.
10.4.5.3.2	The sacrificer is the fourth.
10.4.5.3.3	All desires are the fifth.
10.4.5.3.4	And he who knows this, he knows all this, and the worlds, and himself, and all desires.
10.5.1.1.1	Now this Agni has speech as his Upanishad.
10.5.1.1.2	For it is by speech that one is built up by the Rk, by the Yajus, by the Saman. This is the divine speech.
10.5.1.1.3	But when one says, "Do this," "Do that," by that human speech one is built up.
10.5.1.2.1	That indeed is this speech, divided into three parts: the Rk, Yajus and Sama.
10.5.1.2.2	By that Agni is divided into three parts.
10.5.1.2.3	For it is by this threefold division that he is built.
10.5.1.2.4	Even so he is divided into three.
10.5.1.2.5	But he is divided into threefold in this way: the bricks are laid in him with masculine, feminine and neuter names.
10.5.1.2.6	These parts of man are divided into three kinds, namely, those having masculine names, those having feminine names, and those having neuter names.
10.5.1.3.1	This Self is divided into three kinds.
10.5.1.3.2	He, by means of this Self which is divided into three, attains this heaven which is divided into the three kinds, and immortality.
10.5.1.3.3	All these are called bricks, not brick, not bricks, in the form of words.
10.5.1.3.4	Speech alone is all this, namely, woman, man, and neuter.
10.5.1.3.5	For speech alone is all this.
10.5.1.3.6	Therefore he makes them all settle down as Angiras, not as Angiras, nor as Angiras.
10.5.1.3.7	For he makes this speech settle down.
10.5.1.4.1	That which is that speech, that is the sun.
10.5.1.4.2	That is indeed death.
10.5.1.4.3	Whatever is beyond the sun, all that is attained by death.
10.5.1.4.4	He who builds anything beyond it, he builds it attained by death. Death.
10.5.1.4.5	He offers himself to death.
10.5.1.4.6	Now he who builds it above that, conquers death again.
10.5.1.4.7	For by knowledge this is built above him.
10.5.1.5.1	This indeed is speech, divided into three parts: the Rk, Yajus and Sama.
10.5.1.5.2	The Rk is indeed the circle.
10.5.1.5.3	The Sama is the Rk.
10.5.1.5.4	The Yajus is the man.
10.5.1.5.5	Now this is the immortal, namely this shining light. This is the lotus leaf.
10.5.1.5.6	When he builds the fire on the lotus leaf, he makes his body consisting of the Rk, Yajus and Sama in this immortal.
10.5.1.5.7	He becomes immortal.
10.5.2.1.1	This is the great praise, those are the verses.
10.5.2.1.2	That is the world of the verses.
10.5.2.1.3	And that which shines here as light, that is the great vow, those are the chants.
10.5.2.1.4	That is world of the chants.
10.5.2.1.5	And that person here in this circle, that is Agni, those are the mantras.
10.5.2.1.6	That is a world of the mantras.
10.5.2.2.1	This is the only three-fold knowledge that shines.
10.5.2.2.2	But even the ignorant say this: "This is the only three fold knowledge that shines."
10.5.2.2.3	Speech alone sees and speaks.
10.5.2.3.1	This is indeed death, this is the person in this circle.
10.5.2.3.2	But this is indeed immortality, this is the light that shines.
10.5.2.3.3	Therefore, Death does not die.
10.5.2.3.4	For immortality is within.
10.5.2.3.5	Therefore, it is not seen.
10.5.2.3.6	For immortality lies within.
10.5.2.4.1	This is the verse: "The immortal is within Death."
10.5.2.4.2	For this is the lesser of Death, the immortal.
10.5.2.4.3	Death has placed the immortal within.
10.5.2.4.4-11	For in this world the man is established in this circle and shines. Death is the garment of Vivasvan. This very sun is Vivasvan. For this one is the garment of day and night. He wears it. For he is completely surrounded by it. The self of death is Vivasvan's. For in this circle the self of this man is established.
10.5.2.4.12	This is the verse:
10.5.2.5.1	This is the circle of support for both of them, for both of them - for this one and for the person.
10.5.2.5.2	Therefore one should not praise the great hymn for another, lest one cut off this support.
10.5.2.5.3	He who praises the great hymn for someone else cuts off that support.
10.5.2.5.4	Therefore, they call it the most abundant Utkha-sasa.
10.5.2.5.5	For it is cut off from the foundation.
10.5.2.5.6	Thus, it is about the deity.
10.5.2.6.1	Now, about the sacrifice.
10.5.2.6.2	This is the golden disc that shines.
10.5.2.6.3	And this is the lotus leaf that glows.
10.5.2.6.4	These are the waters.
10.5.2.6.5	The waters are the lotus leaf.
10.5.2.6.6	Now, that person in this circle is indeed the same as the golden person here.
10.5.2.6.7	Having thus arranged these three, he places them here.
10.5.2.6.8	He then ascends beyond the establishment of the sacrifice.
10.5.2.6.9	He then reaches that which shines here.
10.5.2.6.10	Therefore, one should not neglect Agni.
10.5.2.6.11	For there he is at that time.
10.5.2.6.12	Thus indeed is the Adhyatma (the inner science).
10.5.2.7.1	Now the Adhyatman (the inner science):
10.5.2.7.2	What shines as this circle and what is this golden (light), that is the white (light).
10.5.2.7.3	And what shines as this light and what is this lotus leaf, that is the black (light).
10.5.2.7.4	Now, he who is the person in this circle and he who is the golden person, he is the same as the person in the right eye.
10.5.2.8.1	He is indeed Lokamprana.
10.5.2.8.2	All Agni comes together in her.
10.5.2.8.3	His mate is the person in the left eye.
10.5.2.8.4	Half of the self is the pair.
10.5.2.8.5	When one is with the pair, then one is whole, for the sake of wholeness.
10.5.2.8.6	That there are two of them is because the pair is a duality, a procreation.
10.5.2.8.7	Therefore two Lokamprinas are placed.
10.5.2.8.8	Therefore they build the altar with two (bricks).
10.5.2.9.1	This very Indra is the man in the right eye.
10.5.2.9.2	And this is Indrani.
10.5.2.9.3	The gods made this support for them, the nose.
10.5.2.9.4	Therefore one should not eat at the end of one's wife.
10.5.2.9.5	One becomes vigorous from it, and she gives birth to a vigorous child, for whom one does not eat at the conclusion.
10.5.2.10.1	This is the divine vow.
10.5.2.10.2	The Rājanas, the relatives of the king, protect the best of men.
10.5.2.10.3	Therefore, a hero is born among them.
10.5.2.10.4	The words of immortality, the life of the young, quickly generates the swift-moving one.
10.5.2.11.1	They enter the space of the heart and become united.
10.5.2.11.2	When they reach the end of union, then this man sleeps.
10.5.2.11.3	Just as a human couple, having gone to the end of their union, become unconscious, so also does this (couple).
10.5.2.11.4	For this is the divine couple.
10.5.2.11.5	For this is indeed the highest bliss.
10.5.2.12.1	Therefore one who knows thus should sleep.
10.5.2.12.2	For this (couple) is indeed the world.
10.5.2.12.3	These two deities are united with their beloved abode.
10.5.2.12.4	Therefore, indeed, one should not wake up a sleeping person, lest the two deities who are united should be harmed.
10.5.2.12.5	Therefore, indeed, the face of one who is sleeping becomes like phlegm.
10.5.2.12.6	These two deities indeed sprinkle semen.
10.5.2.12.7	Therefore, from semen this entire (universe) originates, whatever this is.
10.5.2.13.1	This very one is death, the person in this circle and the person in the right eye.
10.5.2.13.2	His feet are very much cut off in his heart.
10.5.2.13.3	He comes out after cutting them off.
10.5.2.13.4	When he comes out, then this person dies.
10.5.2.13.5	Therefore they call him the dead, saying, 'He has cut off this.'
10.5.2.14.1	This indeed is the vital breath.
10.5.2.14.2	For he directs all these creatures.
10.5.2.14.3	These are his vital breaths, his own.
10.5.2.14.4	When he sleeps, then these vital breaths, his owns, return to him.
10.5.2.14.5	Therefore sleep is called 'svapya' (sleep).
10.5.2.14.6	They call him who sleeps 'svapya', because he is remote.
10.5.2.14.7	The gods desire the remote.
10.5.2.15.1	He who is asleep with these (senses) does not know anything, does not think with the mind, does not taste the taste of food, does not smell the smell with the breath, does not see with the eye, does not hear with the ear.
10.5.2.15.2	For these are absorbed in him.
10.5.2.15.3	He, being one, is widely distributed among beings.
10.5.2.15.4	Therefore, the one Satī Lokampṛṇā pervades the entire Agni.
10.5.2.15.5	And because there is only one, therefore there is only one.
10.5.2.16.1	They say, "Death is one, but many."
10.5.2.16.2	One should say, "One and many."
10.5.2.16.3	Because he is one there, therefore one.
10.5.2.16.4	And because he is distributed in many ways among the beings here, therefore many.
10.5.2.17.1	They say that death is near, and far.
10.5.2.17.2	One should say that it is both near and far.
10.5.2.17.3	That which is here in the body is near.
10.5.2.17.4	That which one has there is far.
10.5.2.18.1	This is the verse: "He shines in food, dependent on the senses, the nectar that flows away."
10.5.2.18.2	What shines in this circle is food.
10.5.2.18.3	And that person who is in this circle, he is Agni, and he shines in this food.
10.5.2.18.4	Thus it is about the deity.
10.5.2.19.1	Now about the inner self:
10.5.2.19.2	This body itself is food.
10.5.2.19.3	Now that person who is in the right eye, he is Agni, and he shines in this food, having resorted to it.
10.5.2.20.1	The Adhvaryus worship him as Agni, the Yajus-knowers as Yajus.
10.5.2.20.2	For he indeed unites all this.
10.5.2.20.3	The Chandogas as Sama.
10.5.2.20.4	For all this is equal in him.
10.5.2.20.5	The Bahvricas as Uktha.
10.5.2.20.6	For this indeed supports all this.
10.5.2.20.7	"Yatu" means "one who knows the Yatu."
10.5.2.20.8	For this indeed supports all that.
10.5.2.20.9	"Visa" means "serpents."
10.5.2.20.10	"Serpents" means "one knowing serpents."
10.5.2.20.11	"Urga" means "gods."
10.5.2.20.12	"Rayi" means "men."
10.5.2.20.13	"Maya" means "Asuras."
10.5.2.20.14	"Svadha" means "fathers."
10.5.2.20.15	"Devajan" means "one knowledgeable about the Devajan."
10.5.2.20.16	"Rupa" means "Gandharvas."
10.5.2.20.17	Gandha is the Apsarases.
10.5.2.20.18	Whatever they worship, that they become.
10.5.2.20.19	They become that.
10.5.2.20.20	Therefore one who knows this should worship with all of them.
10.5.2.20.21	All of this becomes.
10.5.2.20.22	All of that becomes that.
10.5.2.21.1	This Agni is three-fold: one verse, one Yajus, one Sama.
10.5.2.22.2	For both the Rk and the Yajus are drunk by the two.
10.5.2.22.3	Thus is the one-brick (fire).
10.5.2.23.1	This indeed is death, the person in this circle and the person in the right eye.
10.5.2.23.2	He who knows thus becomes the Self.
10.5.2.23.3	When he who knows thus departs from this world, then he enters this Self.
10.5.3.2.2	It is neither existent nor non-existent.
10.5.3.3.1	This mind, created, became manifest, more defined, more embodied.
10.5.3.3.2	It sought its own self.
10.5.3.3.3	It performed austerities.
10.5.3.3.4	It fainted.
10.5.3.3.5	It saw sixty-three thousand fires, suns, made of mind, of mind, of the mind.
10.5.3.3.6-11	They were recited by the mind. They were recited by the Mind. The Grahas were seized by the Mind. They praised by the Mind. The Mind sang. Whatever rite is performed in the sacrifice, whatever rite is sacrificial, that was done by the Mind in them, in those consisting of Mind, in those consisting in Mind, in those of Mind.
10.5.3.3.12	Whatever these beings resolve upon with their minds, that is their accomplishment. They place them in those (beings), they construct them in those (deities), they take up the Grahas in those (devas), they praise in those (deity), they proclaim in those (deitys).
10.5.3.3.13	This is the extent of the mind's power, this is the extent of its creation. The mind has thirty-six thousand fires, suns.
10.5.3.3.14	Each of them is as much as the former one.
10.5.3.4.1	He created speech from that.
10.5.3.4.2	This speech, created, became more defined and more concrete.
10.5.3.4.3	It sought itself.
10.5.3.4.4	It performed austerities.
10.5.3.4.5	It fainted.
10.5.3.4.6	She saw thirty-six thousand fires, suns, consisting of speech, consisting of speech.
10.5.3.4.7	They were studied by speech.
10.5.3.4.8	They are studied by speech. 
10.5.3.4.9	The Grahas were seized by speech.
10.5.3.4.10	Speech praised.
10.5.3.4.11	Speech praised.
10.5.3.4.12	Whatever rite is performed in a sacrifice, whatever rite is to be performed in a sacrifice - all that is done in the form of speech, in the form of the mind of speech.
10.5.3.4.13	Whatever these beings speak with speech, that is their creation. They place them, they build them, they take up the Grahas in them, they praise them, they proclaim them.
10.5.3.4.14	This is the extent of the power of speech, this is the extent of its creation, this is the speech, thirty-six thousand fires, suns.
10.5.3.4.15	Each one of them is as big as the previous one.
10.5.3.5.1	That speech created the vital breath.
10.5.3.5.2	This vital breath, created, shone forth, became more defined, more embodied.
10.5.3.5.3	He sought himself.
10.5.3.5.4	He performed austerities.
10.5.3.5.5	He fainted.
10.5.3.5.6	He saw sixty thousand fires, suns, made of breath, consisting of breath, in himself.
10.5.3.5.7	They were sustained by breath.
10.5.3.5.8	They were supported by breath.
10.5.3.5.9	The Grahas were seized by breath.
10.5.3.5.10	Breath was praised.
10.5.3.5.11	He hopes for life.
10.5.3.5.12	Whatever rite is performed in a sacrifice, whatever rite is to be performed in a sacrifice is done by means of the breath. That which is done in those rites, which are made of the breath, which are of the nature of the breath, is done in the form of the breath.
10.5.3.5.13	Now, whatever these beings breathe through the breath, that is their work. They place them, they build them, they take up the Grahas in them, they praise them, they recite in them.
10.5.3.5.14	This is the extent of the power of the vital breath, this is the extent of creation, this is the vital breath, thirty-six thousand fires, suns.
10.5.3.5.15	Each one of them is as much as the former one.
10.5.3.6.1	He, the vital breath, created the eye.
10.5.3.6.2	This eye, created, shone forth, more defined, more embodied.
10.5.3.6.3-10	He sought his own self. He performed austerities. It became unconscious. It saw thirty-six thousand fires and suns, consisting of the eye, in its own self. They were seen by the eye itself. They were collected by the eye. The planets were seized by the eye. The eye praised them.
10.5.3.6.11	He saw with his eyes.
10.5.3.6.12	Whatever rite is performed in a sacrifice, whatever rite is to be performed in a sacrifice - all that was done with the eyes, in those rites which were done with the eyes and which were done with mind, it was done with the eye.
10.5.3.6.13	Now, whatever these beings see with the eye, that is their work. They place them, they build them, they take up the Grahas in them, they praise them, they proclaim them.
10.5.3.6.14	This is the extent of the eye's power, this is the extent of its creation, this is the eye, thirty-six thousand fires, suns.
10.5.3.6.15	Each of them is as large as the previous one.
10.5.3.7.1	It created the ear.
10.5.3.7.2	This ear, created, became more defined, more embodied.
10.5.3.7.3	He sought his own Self.
10.5.3.7.4	He performed austerities.
10.5.3.7.5	It became unconscious.
10.5.3.7.6	It saw sixty-three thousand fires, suns, consisting of hearing, made of hearing.
10.5.3.7.7	They studied with hearing alone.
10.5.3.7.8	They were studied with hearing.
10.5.3.7.9	The planets were seized by them with hearing.
10.5.3.7.10	The Srotra (ear) praised.
10.5.3.7.11	The Srotra (ears) desired.
10.5.3.7.12	Whatever rite is performed in a sacrifice, whatever rite is to be performed in a sacrifice - that rite was performed in the Srotra-made, Srotra-composed, Srotra.
10.5.3.7.13	Now, whatever these beings hear with the ear, that is their own doing. They place them, they build them, they take up the Grahas in them, they praise them, they proclaim them.
10.5.3.7.14	This is the extent of the greatness of the ear, this is the extent of its creation, this is the ear, thirty-six thousand fires, suns.
10.5.3.7.15	Each one of them is as great as the previous one.
10.5.3.8.1	That ear created action.
10.5.3.8.2	It united with the vital airs, this is the food-oblation, the food-oblations.
10.5.3.8.3	The action is incomplete without the vital airs.
10.5.3.8.4	The vital airs are incomplete without action.
10.5.3.9.1	This action, having been created, desired to be more manifest and more embodied.
10.5.3.9.2	It sought out its own self.
10.5.3.9.3	It performed austerities.
10.5.3.9.4	It became unconscious.
10.5.3.9.5	He saw that there were thirty-six thousand fires, suns, made of deeds, created by deeds.
10.5.3.9.6	They were governed by deeds.
10.5.3.9.7	Were created by deeds. 
10.5.3.9.8	The planets were seized by deeds.
10.5.3.9.9	Praised by deeds.
10.5.3.9.10	Described by deeds.
10.5.3.9.11	Whatever rite is performed in a sacrifice, whatever rite is fit for a sacrifice, that rite is performed in those rites which are made of rites, which are fashioned by rites.
10.5.3.9.12	Whatever rite these beings perform, that is their doing. They place them, they fashion them, they take up the Grahas in them, they praise them, they recite them.
10.5.3.9.13	This is the extent of the glory of the rite, this is the extent of creation, this is the limit of the rite, thirty-six thousand fires, suns.
10.5.3.9.14	Each one of them is as big as the former one.
10.5.3.10.1	He created Agni, the rite.
10.5.3.10.2	Agni is the most extensive of rites.
10.5.3.10.3	For it is by the rite that they generate him, and by the rite they kindle him.
10.5.3.11.1	This Agni, created, shone forth, more defined, more embodied.
10.5.3.11.2	He sought himself.
10.5.3.11.3	He performed austerities.
10.5.3.11.4	He fainted.
10.5.3.11.5	He saw sixty-three thousand fires, suns, made of fire, built of fire, within himself.
10.5.3.11.6	They were governed by fire.
10.5.3.11.7	The oblations were offered by Agni.
10.5.3.11.8	The Grahas were taken by Agni.
10.5.3.11.9	They praised by Agni.
10.5.3.11.10	Agni was invoked.
10.5.3.11.11	Whatever rite is performed in a sacrifice, whatever rite is to be performed, all that was performed by Agni in the fires of Agni, in the fires of the Agni-kindling.
10.5.3.11.12	Now, whatever these beings offer to Agni, it is for them alone that he does it. They place them (in the fire), they pile them up, they take up the cups on them, they praise them, they recite on them.
10.5.3.11.13	This is the extent of Agni's greatness, this is the extent of his creation, this is the size of Agni. There are thirty-six thousand fires, suns.
10.5.3.11.14	Each one of them is as big as the one before.
10.5.3.12.1	These are indeed the ones that are known through knowledge.
10.5.3.12.2	All beings always worship these ones known through knowledge, even while sleeping.
10.5.3.12.3	Those who know thus, are indeed known through knowledge.
10.5.4.1.1	This very world is the fire that is kindled.
10.5.4.1.2	Its enclosing stones are indeed water.
10.5.4.1.3	The bricks of the Yajurveda are men, the Sūdadohas.
10.5.4.1.4	The plants and trees are the excrement.
10.5.4.1.5	The oblations are the kindling woods.
10.5.4.1.6	Agni is the Lokampṛṇā.
10.5.4.1.7	All this indeed comes together in Agni.
10.5.4.1.8	All Agni comes together in Lokamprana.
10.5.4.1.9	He who knows this, all this comes together in him as in Lokamprana, the existent.
10.5.4.2.1	This Agni indeed is built in the sky.
10.5.4.2.2	Its boundary is the junction of heaven and earth.
10.5.4.2.3	The one beyond that unites heaven and earth.
10.5.4.2.4	Those are the enclosing stones.
10.5.4.2.5	The bricks are the wings.
10.5.4.2.6	The Sūdadoha are the rains.
10.5.4.2.7	The Marīci are the excrement.
10.5.4.2.8	The Āhutis are the kindling woods.
10.5.4.2.9	Vāyu is the Lokampṛṇā.
10.5.4.2.10	All this indeed comes together in Vāyu.
10.5.4.2.11	All Agni, indeed, is united with Lokamprana.
10.5.4.2.12	He who knows this, indeed, is Lokamprana, and all this is united with him.
10.5.4.3.1	This Agni, indeed, has been kindled in the sky.
10.5.4.3.2	Its covering is water.
10.5.4.3.3	Just as this world is enclosed by a sheath, so these worlds are enclosed in water.
10.5.4.3.4	Those who are beyond these worlds are the Parashritas.
10.5.4.3.5	The bricks of the gods are the Yajus.
10.5.4.3.6	Whatever food there is in this world, those are the Sooda-dohas.
10.5.4.3.7	The stars are the excrement.
10.5.4.3.8	The oblations are the kindling woods.
10.5.4.3.9	The Lokamprana is the sun.
10.5.4.3.10	All this indeed converges on the sun.
10.5.4.3.11	All Agni, indeed, is united with Lokamprana.
10.5.4.3.12	He who knows this, indeed, is Lokamprana, and all this is united with him.
10.5.4.4.1	This Agni, indeed, which is set up, is the sun.
10.5.4.4.2	Its directions are the enclosing walls.
10.5.4.4.3	They are sixty-three hundred in number.
10.5.4.4.4	And sixty and three hundred directions surround the sun.
10.5.4.4.5	The bricks are in the form of Yajus.
10.5.4.4.6	They are sixty and three hundred in number.
10.5.4.4.7	Sixty and three hundred are the rays of the sun.
10.5.4.4.8	When he offers the oblations in the directions, he offers them in the directions.
10.5.4.4.9	When he offers the oblation between the directions and the rays, he offers it between the directions and rays.
10.5.4.4.10	When he makes an offering in the directions and rays, he makes an offering of food in the directions and the ray.
10.5.4.4.11	Those are the oblations.
10.5.4.4.12	Those are kindling woods.
10.5.4.4.13	Now, what is called the directions and the rays, that is the Lokamprinā.
10.5.4.4.14	That is called the directions as well as the rays.
10.5.4.4.15	All Agni comes together in the Lokamprinã.
10.5.4.4.16	He who knows this, all this comes together in him as in the Lokamprina.
10.5.4.5.1	The fire thus built is the stars.
10.5.4.5.2	These are the twenty-seven stars.
10.5.4.5.3	The stars are twenty-seven, and the stars of the Hopa are twenty-seven. Each star has a star of the Hopa as its companion.
10.5.4.5.4	They are seven hundred and twenty, and sixty-three more.
10.5.4.5.5	Then the seven hundred and twenty bricks are the sixty-three bricks, the sixty-three Yajus-bricks.
10.5.4.5.6	Then the thirty-six above that is the thirteenth month, that is the Self.
10.5.4.5.7	The Self is thirty.
10.5.4.5.8	Two are the foundation.
10.5.4.5.9	The head is the thirty-six.
10.5.4.5.10	The two of them are the two syllables of the head.
10.5.4.5.11	The two between the stars are the Sūdadohas.
10.5.4.5.12	The food in the stars is the excrement.
10.5.4.5.13	Those are the oblations.
10.5.4.5.14	Those are kindling woods.
10.5.4.5.15	And what is called the stars is the Lokampṛṇā.
10.5.4.5.16	All this is called the stars.
10.5.4.5.17	All Agni, indeed, is united with Lokamprana.
10.5.4.5.18	He who knows this, indeed, is Lokamprana, and all this is united with him.
10.5.4.6.1	These are the twenty-one Brihatis.
10.5.4.6.2	The world of heaven is twenty-one.
10.5.4.6.3	The Brihatī is the world of heaven.
10.5.4.6.4	He attains the heaven world and the Ekavimsa stoma and the Brihatî metre.
10.5.4.7.1	Indeed, this Agni is the metres.
10.5.4.7.2	These are the seven metres, increasing by four.
10.5.4.7.3	They have three feet. There are seven hundred and twenty syllables in them, over thirty-six.
10.5.4.7.4	Then the seven hundred and twenty bricks are the sixty-three bricks, the sixty-three Yajus-bricks.
10.5.4.7.5	Then the thirty-six above that is the thirteenth month, that is the Self.
10.5.4.7.6	The Self is thirty.
10.5.4.7.7	Two are the foundation.
10.5.4.7.8	Two are Prāṇas.
10.5.4.7.9	The head is indeed thirty-six syllables.
10.5.4.7.10	That it has two (syllables) is because the head has two syllables.
10.5.4.8.1	Of that thirty-six-syllabled Brihatī, the first ten syllables are one foot of ten syllables.
10.5.4.8.2	Then the twenty (syllables), that is a two-footed verse of twenty syllables.
10.5.4.8.3	Now, those thirty are the Viraj with thirty syllables.
10.5.4.8.4	Now, those thirty-three are the Trayastrimsa with thirty-three syllables.
10.5.4.8.5	Now those thirty-four are the Svaraj with thirty-four syllables.
10.5.4.8.6	Now that Agni is built with all the metres, that is the Atichanda.
10.5.4.8.7	All of them are indeed bricks.
10.5.4.8.8	The three syllables 'Iṣṭaka' are the three feet of the Gāyatrī.
10.5.4.8.9	Therefore this Agni is Gāyatrī (verse).
10.5.4.8.10	The three syllables 'Earth, Water' are the three-footed Gāyatrī verse.
10.5.4.8.11	Therefore this is Gāyatrī (verse).
10.5.4.8.12	Now what is between the verses is the Sūdadohas.
10.5.4.8.13	Now what is in the verses is the Puṣa.
10.5.4.8.14	Those are the oblations.
10.5.4.8.15	Those are kindling woods.
10.5.4.8.16	Now, when it is said, "the metres," that is the Lokamprinā.
10.5.4.8.17	That is indeed said to be all the metres.
10.5.4.8.18	All Agni comes to the Lokamprină.
10.5.4.8.19	He who indeed knows this, all this comes to him as the Lokamprinã.
10.5.4.9.1	Those are the twenty-one Brihatī verses.
10.5.4.9.2	The world of heaven is indeed twenty-one.
10.5.4.9.3	Brihatī is the heavenly world.
10.5.4.9.4	He attains the heavenly world and the Ekavimsa stoma and the Brihatī metre.
10.5.4.10.1	This Agni indeed is the year.
10.5.4.10.2	Its nights are the enclosing stones.
10.5.4.10.3	They are sixty-three hundred in number.
10.5.4.10.4	Sixty-three hundred are the nights of the year.
10.5.4.10.5	The bricks are the days.
10.5.4.10.6	They are sixty and three hundred in number.
10.5.4.10.7	There are sixty and three hundreds of days in a year.
10.5.4.10.8	Now those thirty-six bricks which are left over, that is the thirteenth month, and the half-months and months, those twenty-four half-months, twelve months.
10.5.4.10.9	Now that which is between day and night, that is the Sūda-dohas.
10.5.4.10.10	Now that food in the days and nights, that is excrement.
10.5.4.10.11	Those are the oblations.
10.5.4.10.12	Those are kindling woods.
10.5.4.10.13	Now that which is called the 'days and nights' is the Lokamprana.
10.5.4.10.14	That is called all the days and nights.
10.5.4.10.15	All Agni comes to the end of the Lokamprana,
10.5.4.10.16	He who knows this, all this comes to the end for him.
10.5.4.11.1	Those are the twenty-one Brihatis.
10.5.4.11.2	The world of heaven is indeed twenty-one.
10.5.4.11.3	The world of heaven is the Brihatī.
10.5.4.11.4	He thus attains the world of heaven and the Stoma of twenty-one and the Brihatī metre.
10.5.4.12.1	This indeed is the self, the Agni that is being built.
10.5.4.12.2	His bones are indeed the enclosing stones.
10.5.4.12.3	They are sixty-three in number.
10.5.4.12.4	There are sixty and three hundred bones in a man.
10.5.4.12.5	The bones are the bricks of the Yajurveda.
10.5.4.12.6	They are sixty and three hundreds in number.
10.5.4.12.7	There are sixty and three hundered bones in a man.
10.5.4.12.8	Now those thirty-six bricks which are left over, that is the thirteenth month, the Self, the Prāṇa.
10.5.4.12.9	It has thirty-two forms in the Self, two in the foundation, two in the head.
10.5.4.12.10	That it has two, because the head has two skull-bones.
10.5.4.12.11	And those joints which are continuous, they are the Sūdadohas.
10.5.4.12.12	Now this triad, by which this Self is covered, namely, hair, skin, and flesh, that is excrement.
10.5.4.12.13	What he drinks, those are the oblations.
10.5.4.12.14	What he eats, those are the kindling woods.
10.5.4.12.15	And what is called the Self, that is the Lokamprinā.
10.5.4.12.16	And this is called the Self in its entirety.
10.5.4.12.17	The entire Agni comes to rest in the Lokamprinã.
10.5.4.12.18	He who knows this, he attains all this world, the Lokamprana.
10.5.4.13.1	These are the twenty-one Brihatis.
10.5.4.13.2	The heaven world is twenty-one.
10.5.4.13.3	The heaven-world is Brihatī.
10.5.4.13.4	He attains the heaven-world and the twenty-one Stoma and the Brihatī metre.
10.5.4.14.1	All the beings, all the gods, this Agni is indeed kindled.
10.5.4.14.2	The waters are indeed all the gods, all the beings.
10.5.4.14.3	These waters are indeed this Agni kindled.
10.5.4.14.4	Its enclosing sticks are indeed the waters.
10.5.4.14.5	They are sixty-three in number.
10.5.4.14.6	And sixty and three hundred Nāvyas go round the sun on all sides.
10.5.4.14.7	The bricks of the Nāvyas are indeed Yajus-bearing.
10.5.4.14.8	They are sixty and three hundred in number.
10.5.4.14.9	Sixty and three hundred Nāvya-cows go round the sun.
10.5.4.14.10	And what is between the Nāvyās, that is the Sūda-dohas.
10.5.4.14.11	Now those thirty-six bricks which are left over, that is the thirteenth month, and he is the golden man.
10.5.4.15.1	His two supports are the golden leaf and the lotus leaf, the water and the orb of the sun.
10.5.4.15.2	The two ladles are the arms.
10.5.4.15.3	They are Indra and Agni.
10.5.4.15.4	The two self-spread ones are this (earth) and the sky.
10.5.4.15.5	These three are the lights of the world, these are the deities: Agni, Vayu, and Aditya.
10.5.4.15.6	For these deities are the light of the world.
10.5.4.15.7	The twelve seasons are the year, that is the Self.
10.5.4.15.8	The five are the five-crested ones, that is the sacrifice, those are the gods.
10.5.4.15.9	And what is the variegated one, the self-spread one, and the speckled stone?
10.5.4.15.10	The Agni which is deposited in the mind, that is the thirty-five.
10.5.4.15.11	The Yajus of Lokamprana is the thirty-six.
10.5.4.15.12	This is the end of all of him.
10.5.4.15.13	This is in the middle of all waters.
10.5.4.15.14	This is endowed with all desires.
10.5.4.15.15	All desires are water.
10.5.4.15.16	This is desireless, all-desiring.
10.5.4.15.17	For no one desires it.
10.5.4.16.1	This is the verse: By knowledge they ascend to that place where desires have gone away. There the gifts do not go, nor the ignorant ascetics.
10.5.4.16.2	Indeed, that world is not attained by gifts or austerities by one who does not know thus.
10.5.4.16.3	Indeed, it is only those who know thus who attain that world.
10.5.4.17.1	The excrement is cloud.
10.5.4.17.2	The oblations are the moon.
10.5.4.17.3	The stars are the kindling-sticks.
10.5.4.17.4	The oblation which the moon dwells in the stars, that dwells in the kindling-stick.
10.5.4.17.5	This indeed is the food of the oblation, this is its support.
10.5.4.17.6	Therefore the oblation is not exhausted.
10.5.4.17.7	For this is its food, this is its suppoit.
10.5.4.17.8	And what is called the gods, that is the Lokamprinā.
10.5.4.17.9	That is why it is called 'all the gods'.
10.5.4.18.1	This is said in a verse: 'All the gods follow that, the Yajus is their teacher.'
10.5.4.18.2	Because all beings and all gods are indeed Yajus.
10.5.4.18.3	All Agni comes to be united with Lokamprana.
10.5.4.18.4	He who knows this, he attains all this world, the Lokamprana.
10.5.4.19.1	These are the twenty-one Brihatis.
10.5.4.19.2	The heaven world is twenty-one.
10.5.4.19.3	The heaven-world is Brihatī.
10.5.4.19.4	He attains the heaven-world and the twenty-one Stoma and the Brihatī metre.
10.5.5.1.1	Kusri, son of Vājasrava, was going to make a fire-altar.
10.5.5.1.2	Gautama, the son of Kusha, said to him, "You have made the fire-altar facing the east, you have made it facing the west, you have made the fire altar facing the north, you have made fire altar facing the south, you have made a fire altar with its mouth upwards.
10.5.5.2.1	If you had made him face east, then it would have been as if one were to bring food from behind to one who is seated facing away.
10.5.5.2.2	It will not accept your offering.
10.5.5.3.1	If you had made him turn towards the west, then why did you make his tail at the back?
10.5.5.6.1	He said, "I have placed him facing east, facing west, facing north, facing down, facing all directions."
10.5.5.7.1	When he places the eastern man, the eastern ladle, he is placed facing east.
10.5.5.7.2	Then when he lays down the tortoise with its head towards the east, he lays down the heads of the animals towards the east, and it is laid down towards the east.
10.5.5.7.3	Then when he lays down a tortoise with its head to the north, he lays down heads of animals towards the north, and the bricks towards the north, so it is laid down to the north.
10.5.5.7.4	Then when he lays down the bricks in the form of a man, with the ladle in the form of an outstretched man, the pestle in the form of outstretched man, and the mortar in the form of stretched out man, then it is laid down in the form of the outstretched man.
10.5.5.7.5	Then when he lays down bricks in the form moving around in all directions, then it is spread out in all directions.
10.5.5.8.1	Then indeed those who were searching for the fire with the fire-sticks, they ran to the fire with the head already fixed.
10.5.5.8.2	Among them one said, "The head is indeed prosperity."
10.5.5.8.3	He ascended his prosperity.
10.5.5.8.4	"He is being stretched beyond all the boundaries."
10.5.5.8.5	He indeed was like that.
10.5.5.9.1	Then one said, "Indeed the head is the vital airs."
10.5.5.9.2	He ascended the vital airs of him.
10.5.5.9.3	"He will soon come to this world."
10.5.5.9.4	He indeed became like that.
10.5.5.10.1	The Darbha-grass, the bricks in the form of lotus-leaves, the golden man, the two ladles, the naturally grown grass, the bricks in shape of the Dūrvā-grass, the two Yajus-verses, the two Retah-sīcas, the Viśva-jyoti, the Rtāvya, the Aṣāḍha, and the tortoise, all these are the upward-going things which are piled up.
10.5.5.10.2	Now, indeed, this is the most visible head of him, where the Agni is deposited in the Cit.
10.5.5.10.3	Therefore, one should not speculate.
10.6.1.1.1	Then indeed those two, Sātyayajña Paulastya and Mahāśāla Jābāla, and Budhila Aśvatarāśva, Indradyumna Bhāllaveya, and Jan Śārkara-ākṣya, approached Arunaupaveśa.
10.6.1.1.2	They assembled around Vaiśvānara.
10.6.1.1.3	Among them, Vaiśvānaran did not assemble.
10.6.1.2.1	They said, "This is the lord of horses, the king of the Kekayas, who knows Vaishvanara.
10.6.1.2.2	Let us go to him."
10.6.1.2.3	They went to the lord of horses.
10.6.1.2.4	He gave them separate dwellings, separate offerings, and separate Soma sacrifices for a thousand men.
10.6.1.2.5	In the morning, they assembled with their hands joined in reverence, saying, "We have come to you."
10.6.1.3.1	He said, "O revered ones, what is this that the Anūcānas and the sons of Anūcāna say?"
10.6.1.3.2	They said, "The revered one knows Vaiśvānara well."
10.6.1.3.3	"Tell us about him."
10.6.1.3.4	He said, "Indeed, I know Vaiśvānaran well.
10.6.1.3.5	He placed the kindling woods.
10.6.1.3.6	"You have come."
10.6.1.4.1	He said to Āruṇi Aupaveśya Gautama, "Do you know Vaiśvānara?"
10.6.1.4.2	He replied, "O king, the earth itself."
10.6.1.4.3	He said, "Oṃ."
10.6.1.4.4	This is indeed Vaiśvānari.
10.6.1.4.5	For you know Vaiśvānarī, the foundation.
10.6.1.4.6	Therefore you are established with offspring and cattle.
10.6.1.4.7	He who knows this Vaiśvānara as the foundation, conquers death again and again and attains the entire span of life.
10.6.1.4.8	These two feet are yours, O Vaiśvānaran.
10.6.1.4.9	"If I had not come, your feet would have been eaten."
10.6.1.4.10	"If I did not come, your two feet would have been unknown."
10.6.1.5.1	Then he said to Satyayajna Paulasty, "Do you know the ancient Vaishvanara?"
10.6.1.5.2	He replied, "The king is indeed water."
10.6.1.5.3	He said, "Om."
10.6.1.5.4	This indeed is the wealth of Vaishvanara.
10.6.1.5.5	For you know this wealth of Vaishvānara.
10.6.1.5.6	Therefore you are wealthy and prosperous.
10.6.1.5.7	He who knows this wealth of Vaisvânara, conquers death again and again, and attains the whole of life.
10.6.1.5.8	This is the bladder of Vaisvâna-ra.
10.6.1.5.9	"If I had not come, this would have been your bladder."
10.6.1.5.10	"If I did not come, this (bladder) would have been unknown to you."
10.6.1.6.1	Then he said to Mahashala Jabala Upanayana, "Do you know the Vaishvanara?"
10.6.1.6.2	He replied, "O king, I know the Vaishvānara as space."
10.6.1.6.3	He replied, "Om!"
10.6.1.6.4	This is the Vaishvânara of many.
10.6.1.6.5	For you know this Vaishvânarâ of many.
10.6.1.6.6	Therefore you are many in progeny and cattle.
10.6.1.6.7	He who knows this Vaiśvānara well, conquers death again and again and attains the whole of life.
10.6.1.6.8	This is your self, the Vaiśvānaran.
10.6.1.6.9	"If you had not come, you would have been unknown to me."
10.6.1.6.10	"If you would not have come, you would not have been known to me."
10.6.1.7.1-6	Then he said to Budil, the son of Asvatara and Asvini, the son of Vyaghrapad, "Do you know the Vaiśvānara?" "The wind, O king," he replied. "Oṃ," he said. "This is the Vaiśvânara who has a separate path. For you know the Vaišvânara who is on a separate path. Therefore, separate chariots follow you.
10.6.1.7.7	He who knows this separate path of Vaiśvānara, conquers death again and again and attains the entire span of life.
10.6.1.7.8	This is your breath, the breath of Vaiśvânara.
10.6.1.7.9	"If I had not come, you would have been without breath."
10.6.1.7.10	"If I would not have come, you would not have known breath."
10.6.1.8.1	Then he said to Indradyumna, "O son of Bhāllaveya, whom do you know as Vaishvānara?"
10.6.1.8.2	He replied, "O king, the sun."
10.6.1.8.3	He said, "Om."
10.6.1.8.4	He is indeed the one with great radiance, Vaishvānari.
10.6.1.8.5	For you know him, the one with great radiant energy, Vaishvânara.
10.6.1.8.6	Therefore, your son, being cooked, being eaten, is present in your house.
10.6.1.8.7	He who knows this Suta Tejasa Vaishvanara conquers death again and again and attains the entire span of life.
10.6.1.8.8	This is the eye of Vaishvanara.
10.6.1.8.9	He said, "If you had not come, I would have been blind."
10.6.1.8.10	Your eyes would not have known if I had not come.
10.6.1.9.1	Then he said to Janaka Sharakara-aksha, "Do you know Vaisvānara?"
10.6.1.9.2	"The heaven itself," he replied.
10.6.1.9.3	"Om," he said.
10.6.1.9.4	This is the standing Vaisvānaran.
10.6.1.9.5	For you know the standing Vaisvanara.
10.6.1.9.6	Therefore you stand above your equals.
10.6.1.9.7	He who knows this Atiṣṭhāna Vaisvānara, conquers death again and attains the whole of life.
10.6.1.9.8	This is the head of Vaisvānaran.
10.6.1.9.9	"If I had not come, your head would have been destroyed."
10.6.1.9.10	"If I would not have come, your head could have been destroyed."
10.6.1.10.1	He said to them, "You know these separate fires of Vaisvânara. You have eaten separately."
10.6.1.10.2	The gods, indeed, are well-known and well-established, as it were, only the size of a span.
10.6.1.10.3	I shall tell you so that you may be established only the size of the span."
10.6.1.11.1	He said, "Pointing out the head, he said, 'This is the standing Vaisvânar.'
10.6.1.11.2	Pointing to the eyes, he said, "This indeed is the very bright Vaishvanara."
10.6.1.11.3	Pointing to the nostrils, he said, "This indeed is the separate path Vaishvanara."
10.6.1.11.4	Pointing to space, he said, "This indeed is the abundant Vaishvanara."
10.6.1.11.5	Pointing to water, he said, “This indeed is the wealth Vaishvanara.”
10.6.1.11.6	Pointing to his chin, he said, "This indeed is the support, the all-pervading Agni."
10.6.1.11.7	This very Agni, the all-encompassing, is the person.
10.6.1.11.8	He who knows this Agni, the allpervading, in the form of a person, established within the person, conquers death again and attains the entire span of life.
10.6.1.11.9	No one can harm him who speaks thus, for the all-pervasive Agni does not harm.
10.6.2.1.1	There are two kinds of fire, the one that is and the one that is not.
10.6.2.1.2	When both come together, it is called the one that is, not the one that is.
10.6.2.2.1	That one that is, is indeed Agni.
10.6.2.2.2	Whatever is offered in it, is offered.
10.6.2.2.3	They call those offerings indirect.
10.6.2.2.4	The gods desire the indirect.
10.6.2.3.1	The sun is the one that is.
10.6.2.8.4	For Agni rises with oblations.
10.6.2.9.1	The Uktha is indeed the sun.
10.6.2.9.2	Its Thana is the moon.
10.6.2.9.3	For the sun rises with the moon. Thus, indeed, is the deity.
10.6.2.10.1	Now, the inner meaning.
10.6.2.10.2	The Ukth is indeed the breath.
10.6.2.10.3	Its Thāna is food.
10.6.2.10.4	For the breath rises with food. Thus, indeed is the Uktha.
10.6.2.10.5	This is the Agni-making, the Arka-making, the Uktha-making man.
10.6.2.10.6	He who worships this man as the Agni-making Arka-making Uktha-making, his enemy, the knower, perishes.
10.6.2.11.1	The fire is kindled by the breath, the wind by the fire, the sun by the wind, the moon by the sun, the stars by the moon, and lightning by the stars.
10.6.2.11.2	Thus far is the radiance in this world and the other world.
10.6.2.11.3	He who knows this shines with all this radiance in this world as well as the other world.
10.6.3.1.1	One should meditate on truth as Brahman.
10.6.3.1.2	Now this man is made of knowledge.
10.6.3.1.3	He goes to the other world according to his knowledge. Having gone to the other world, he is born again according to his knowledge.
10.6.3.2.1	He should worship himself as consisting of mind, having the body of breath, having the form of light, having the nature of space, having the form at will, having the speed of mind, having true resolve, having true firmness, having all smells, having all tastes, having all directions, having abundance, having all this, having no speech, having no respect.
10.6.3.2.2	Just as a grain of rice, or barley, or a grain of shyamaka, so is this person, the inner self, made of gold.
10.6.3.2.3	Just as light is without smoke, so is he greater than heaven, greater than space, greater than this earth, greater than all beings.
10.6.3.2.4	He is the Self of Prāṇa. This is my Self.
10.6.3.2.5	"This is the Self which, having gone forth, one will attain."
10.6.3.2.6	"He who has no doubt about this, he indeed is a knower of the Self," so said Sandilya.
10.6.3.2.7	"So it is."
10.6.4.1.1	Dawn is the head of the sacrificial horse, the sun is the eye, wind is the breath, the open space is the mouth, Agni Vaisvānara is the fire.
10.6.4.1.2	The year is the body of the sacrificer, the heaven is the back, the atmosphere is the belly, the earth is the tail, the directions are the sides, the intermediate directions are the joints, the seasons are the limbs, the months and half-months are the joints, days and nights are the supports, the stars are the bones, the sky is the flesh, the sand is the fat, the rivers are the anus, the liver and the spleen are the mountains, the plants and trees are the hair, the rising sun is the front half, the setting sun is the rear half.
10.6.4.1.3-10	What shines forth, that shines. What shakes, that thunders. What rains, that rains. His speech is his speech. The day gave birth to the horse in front, with greatness. Its birthplace is the eastern ocean. The night gave birth to it behind, with greatness. Its birthplace is the western ocean.
10.6.4.1.11	These two, the horse and the great one, have come together.
10.6.4.1.12	Having become a horse, he carried the gods, as a stallion the Gandharvas, as an ass the Asuras, and as a horse the men.
10.6.4.1.13	The ocean is his kinsman, the ocean is his birthplace.
10.6.5.1.1	Here there was nothing at all in the beginning.
10.6.5.1.2	This was enveloped by death, by hunger.
10.6.5.1.3	For hunger is death.
10.6.5.1.4	He made his mind, "May I be self-existent."
10.6.5.1.5	He went forth worshipping.
10.6.5.1.6	From him who worshipped, the waters were born.
10.6.5.1.7	"Who has become my worshipper?"
10.6.5.1.8	That itself is the reason for the name of Arkyas.
10.6.5.1.9	He who knows this reason for the name Arkyas, indeed, becomes one who has something.
10.6.5.2.1	The waters are indeed Arkyas.
10.6.5.2.2	That which was the arrow of the waters, that became solidified.
10.6.5.2.3	That became the earth.
10.6.5.2.4	On that he toiled.
10.6.5.2.5	From that toil and heat, the essence, the sap, the heat, Agni, turned away.
10.6.5.3.1	He divided himself into three parts: the sun as one part, the wind as one part,
10.6.5.3.2	This very breath is divided into three.
10.6.5.3.3	Its eastern direction is the head,
10.6.5.3.4	The two of them are the two thighs.
10.6.5.3.5	The tail is the western direction.
10.6.5.3.6	The two of them are both thighs.
10.6.5.3.7	The two sides are the southern and northern directions.
10.6.5.3.8	The back is the sky.
10.6.5.3.9	The belly is the atmosphere.
10.6.5.3.10	The chest is this earth.
10.6.5.3.11	He who knows thus, he who knows thus, indeed, he who knows this, he who knows that, he who knows both, he who knows the two, he who knows them, he who knows these, he who knows those, he who knows all, he who knows everything, he who knows it all, he who is all, he who has all, he who possesses all, he who sees all, he who beholds all, he who looks at all, he who observes all, he who understands all, he who comprehends all, he who perceives all, he who realizes all, he who attains all, he who reaches all, he who finds all, he who discovers all, he who obtains all, he who gains all, he who conquers all, he who rules all, he who controls all, he who masters all, he who dominates all, he who governs all, he who presides over all, he who directs all, he who guides all, he who leads all, he who conducts all, he who brings all, he who takes all, he who carries all, he who bears all, he who supports all, he who upholds all, he who sustains all, he who maintains all, he who preserves all, he who protects all, he who defends all, he who guards all, he who watches over all, he is established in the waters, wherever he goes.
10.6.5.3.12	He stands
10.6.5.4.1	He desired, 'May a second self be born to me.'
10.6.5.4.2	He united with speech through the mind, and death through food.
10.6.5.4.3	What was semen became the year.
10.6.5.4.4	Before that there was no year.
10.6.5.4.5	He lived for as long as the year.
10.6.5.4.6	After that time he created it.
10.6.5.4.7	He, being born, spoke.
10.6.5.4.8	He spoke.
10.6.5.4.9	That itself became speech.
10.6.5.5.1	He thought, "If I desire this, I will make food scarce."
10.6.5.5.2	With that speech, he created all this with his own self, whatever there is, the Rg verses, the Yajus mantras, the Sama chants, the metres, the sacrifices, the beings, and the animals.
10.6.5.5.3	Whatever he created, that he ate.
10.6.5.5.4	He eats everything, therefore Aditi is Aditi.
10.6.5.5.5	He becomes the eater of everything, his food becomes everything, he who knows this is the Aditihood of Aditi.
10.6.5.6.1	It occurred to him, 'I shall worship with a greater sacrifice.'
10.6.5.6.2	He exerted himself.
10.6.5.6.3	He performed austerities.
10.6.5.6.4	From him who was exhausted and heated, fame and valour emerged.
10.6.5.6.5	Life-force is fame and valour.
10.6.5.6.6	When that had emerged in the life-force, the body became swollen.
10.6.5.6.7	His mind was in the body alone.
10.6.5.7.1	He desired, "May this be pure for me."
10.6.5.7.2	"May I be united with it."
10.6.5.7.3	Then the horse came into being.
10.6.5.7.4	Whatever was the horse, that became the sacrifice.
10.6.5.7.5	That alone is the horse-sacrifice of the horse-sacrifice.
10.6.5.7.6	He indeed knows the horse-sacrifice who knows it thus.
10.6.5.8.1	He took it away without any obstacle.
10.6.5.8.2	He offered it beyond the year to himself.
10.6.5.8.3	He restored the cattle to the deities.
10.6.5.8.4	Therefore they offer the animal dedicated to all deities, dedicated to Prajapati.
10.6.5.8.5	This is the horse sacrifice, which shines.
10.6.5.8.6	Its body is the year.
10.6.5.8.7	This Agni is the sun.
10.6.5.8.8	Its body are these worlds.
10.6.5.8.9	These two are the horse sacrifice and the sun.
10.6.5.8.10	It becomes one deity again, namely death.
10.6.5.9.6	Kauṣṭa from Māhitthi
10.6.5.9.7	Māhitthi from Vāmakakṣāyana
10.6.5.9.8	Vāmakakṣāyaṇa from Vatsa
10.6.5.9.9	Vatsa from Śāṇḍilya
10.6.5.9.10	Śāṇḍilya from Kuśri
10.6.5.9.11	Kuśri from Yajñavācas, son of Rājasthambha
10.6.5.9.12	Yajñavāca, son of Rājastambha, from Tuṅga, son of Kāvaya
10.6.5.9.13	Tuṅga, son from Kāvaya, from Prajāpati
10.6.5.9.14	Prajapati is Brahma.
10.6.5.9.15	Brahma is self-existent.
10.6.5.9.16	Salutations to Brahma.

1.5.1.1-8	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a battle. The gods, desiring victory, deposited the left Vasu in Agni. "This will be ours if we win." Agni desired it. He went away with it. The gods following it, desiring to win it back, approached it. They desired to take it together. He wept.
1.5.1.9	What he wept, that became Rudra's Rudrahood.
1.5.1.10	What he wept, that turned into silver and gold.
1.5.1.11	Therefore silver and gold are not to be given as Dakṣiṇā.
1.5.1.12	For they are of tears.
1.5.1.13	If one gives on the sacrificial grass, before a year has passed, they weep in his house.
1.5.1.14	Therefore one should not give on the sacrificial grass.
1.5.1.15	Agni said:
1.5.1.16	"This is your share, or this is it."
1.5.1.17	"It is yours alone to be re-established."
1.5.1.18	They said:
1.5.1.19	"He who establishes Agni as his deity, he indeed prospers."
1.5.1.20	Pūṣan took it and prospered by it.
1.5.1.21	Therefore, cattle are called Pūṣan's.
1.5.1.22	Tvaṣṭā placed it.
1.5.1.23	By it Tvaṣṭṛ prospered.
1.5.1.24	Therefore, cattle are called Tvaṣṭra.
1.5.1.25	Manu placed it.
1.5.1.26	Manu prospered by it.
1.5.1.27	Therefore, progeny is called Manu.
1.5.1.28	Dhātā placed it. 
1.5.1.29	Dhātā prospered by it
1.5.1.30	Dhātā is indeed the year.
1.5.1.31	Therefore, the creatures and cattle are born in accordance with the year.
1.5.1.32	He who knows the efficacy of the re-installation becomes prosperous.
1.5.1.33	He who understands his relationship becomes related.
1.5.1.34	Agni, having been installed as a share of the sacrifice, desiring to approach the offspring and cattle of the sacrificer, fled.
1.5.1.35	Having removed (the fire), one should re-install it.
1.5.1.36	He unites him with his own share.
1.5.1.37	And this is indeed his peace.
1.5.1.38	One should place it on the Punarvasu constellation.
1.5.1.39	This is indeed the constellation of the Punarvasus.
1.5.1.40	Having placed him in his own deity, one becomes lustrous.
1.5.1.41	One places it on darbha grass.
1.5.1.42	It is not deficient.
1.5.1.43	One places on darbha grass.
1.5.1.44	He places him on the water, on the plants.
1.5.1.45	The oblation is of five potsherds.
1.5.1.46	There are five seasons.
1.5.1.47	He places him on the seasons.
1.5.2.1	One who removes the fire from the house, offers the sacrifice and the animals to the other world.
1.5.2.2	The oblations are of five potsherbs.
1.5.2.3	The sacrifice is of five kinds.
1.5.2.4	The animals are the Paṅktis.
1.5.2.5	He wins the animals, the sacrifice.
1.5.2.6	He who removes the fire is the destroyer of heroes among the gods.
1.5.2.7	The Brahmanas did not eat his food before.
1.5.2.8	The Yajya and Anuvakya are in Paṅkti form.
1.5.2.9	The sacrifice is in Paṅkti.
1.5.2.10	The man is in Paṅktis.
1.5.2.11	Having thus honoured the gods and Agni, he again places him.
1.5.2.12	They become a hundred syllables.
1.5.2.13	Man has a hundred years of life and a hundred senses.
1.5.2.14	He stands in life and senses.
1.5.2.15	If Agni is installed, he does not prosper, desiring a greater share.
1.5.2.16	If everything is related to Agni,
1.5.2.17	that itself is his prosperity.
1.5.2.18	The speech is released in the house of him who removes the fire.
1.5.2.19	The sacrificer who has released the speech is the lord of the one who has gone beyond.
1.5.2.20	The parts are separated.
1.5.2.21	For the support of speech.
1.5.2.22	For the non-defeat of the sacrificer.
1.5.2.23	He makes the separation.
1.5.2.24	Brahman alone did that.
1.5.2.25	He offers silently.
1.5.2.26	Just as one who has hidden a valuable thing in a secret place, so is it.
1.5.2.27	He offers the Svishtakrit to Agni.
1.5.2.28	Just as one who has concealed a valuable thing in secret, so is it
1.5.2.29	Having uttered the Vibhakti, he makes the Vasat-utterance with the Prayaja.
1.5.2.30	He does not go beyond the place of offering.
1.5.2.31	The Puronuvakya is the sacrificer.
1.5.2.32	These are the offerings to the animals.
1.5.2.33	The oblations which are offered around the cake,
1.5.2.34	they encompass the sacrificer on both sides with the animals.
1.5.2.35	"Having performed the Yajus and having collected the materials, one says, "The Yajus has been performed, the materials have been collected."
1.5.2.36	They say,
1.5.2.37	"The materials are not collected,
1.5.2.38	the Yajus should not be performed."
1.5.2.39	But indeed, the materials are collected,
1.5.2.40	the yajus should be performed,
1.5.2.41	for the prosperity of the sacrifice.
1.5.2.42	Again the chariot is released, the fee.
1.5.2.43	Again the garment is released.
1.5.2.44	Again the bull is released.
1.5.2.45	For the prosperity of the re-establishment.
1.5.2.46	"Seven are thy Agni, seven thy tongues."
1.5.2.47	He offers the Agnihotra.
1.5.2.48	Wherever he has been placed, there he is released.
1.5.2.49	The one who removes Agni is indeed the hero among the gods.
1.5.2.50	Varuna himself afflicted him.
1.5.2.51	One should offer a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni and Varuna.
1.5.2.52	He pleases both the one who is killed and the one who afflicted him with a share.
1.5.2.53	The sacrificer does not suffer any harm.
1.5.3.1	Earth with its extent, heaven with its height, the atmosphere with its greatness,
1.5.3.2	I have placed Agni, the eater of food, for thee, O goddess Aditi, for the eater of food.
1.5.3.3	This spotted cow has gone forth, and returned to her mother.
1.5.3.4	And to her father, the giver of wealth.
1.5.3.5	The thirty-fold abode shines forth. Speech has been given to the moth.
1.5.3.6	He goes forth with his light.
1.5.3.7	The shining one moves within, between his breath and out-breath.
1.5.3.8	The bull has proclaimed the good.
1.5.3.9	What you, angry, have cast away with anger,
1.5.3.10	The good deed, O Agni, we again set forth for you.
1.5.3.11	What you have done in anger, following the earth,
1.5.3.12	The Ādityas, all the gods, the Vasus have brought together.
1.5.3.13	May the mind, the light, enjoy the ghee. May it unite this interrupted sacrifice.
1.5.3.14	May Brihaspati, may all the gods delight in this offering.
1.5.3.15	Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni, seven thy tongues, seven the sages, seven thy dear abodes.
1.5.3.16	Seven are the Hotras, sevenfold they worship thee. Seven are thy wombs; fill them with ghee.
1.5.3.17	Again, O Agni, turn to us with strength, with life,
1.5.3.18	Again, protect us from all sides.
1.5.3.19	With wealth, turn to us, O Agni, swell with the stream,
1.5.3.20	From all sides, from all the worlds.
1.5.3.21	Lekas, Salelas, Suvelas, may the Adityas, enjoying the ghee, come to you.
1.5.3.22	Ketas, Saketas, Suketos, may the Aditvas, enjoying the ghee,
1.5.3.23	May the Adityas, the sons of Aditi, the sons of the sun, enjoy the ghee, as they are being offered.
1.5.4.1	The earth by its own power, the sky by its own power.
1.5.4.2	He says:
1.5.4.3	He indeed bestows blessings on him.
1.5.4.4	The serpents, while decaying, thought:
1.5.4.5	That Kadru's son Kasarnira saw this mantra.
1.5.4.6	Then they cast off their decaying bodies.
1.5.4.7-12	He places the Garhapatya with the verses of the Serpent-king. He places it again, making it new and immortal. And the pure earth did not yield food to him. He saw this mantra. Then it yielded food to him. When he places the Garhaptva with the verses of Serpent-king,
1.5.4.13-23	For the securing of food. Then he places him in this very (earth) which is firm. He says, 'What the angry one has thrown away from you.' He says, 'He has indeed thrown it away from him.' He says again, 'I am again kindling you.' He again kindles him. He says again 'What was thrown away from you by the angry one.' He says He unites him with the deities.
1.5.4.24	The sacrifice of him who removes the fire is indeed cut off.
1.5.4.25	He stands up with the verse addressed to Brihaspati.
1.5.4.26	Brihaspati is indeed the Brahman of the gods.
1.5.4.27	He indeed unites the sacrifice with Brahman.
1.5.4.28	"May he unite this broken sacrifice."
1.5.4.29	He says.
1.5.4.30	For continuity.
1.5.4.31	"May all the gods be pleased here."
1.5.4.32	He says.
1.5.4.33	He offers the sacrifice to the gods through continuity.
1.5.4.34	He says, "Seven are your Agni's kindling woods, seven are your tongues."
1.5.4.35	He says.
1.5.4.36	The seven-seven Agni's dear forms are sevenfold.
1.5.4.37	He re-establishes them.
1.5.4.38	"Again with energy and wealth,"
1.5.4.39	He offers oblations around the sacrificial cake.
1.5.4.40	He encloses the sacrificer on both sides with strength and wealth.
1.5.4.41	The Adityas went from this world to the other world.
1.5.4.42	They were satisfied in that world.
1.5.4.43	They returned to this world, kindled the fire, and offered these oblations.
1.5.4.44	They succeeded.
1.5.4.45	They went to the heavenly world.
1.5.4.46	One who is going to install the fire again after having removed it should offer these oblations.
1.5.4.47	One attains the same prosperity as the sun attained.
1.5.5.1	We approach the rite, we speak the hymn to Agni.
1.5.5.2	May he listen to us, to both of us.
1.5.5.3	The bright light of this ancient one, the cows have milked.
1.5.5.4-8	The thousand-streamed one, the Rishi. Agni is the head of heaven, the lord of earth, the lord of the waters. He quickens the seed of the waters. Here he first came, the Hotar, the most adorable at the sacrifices, with the creators. The Apnavans, the Bhrigus, have praised him in the woods, the brilliant, the all-pervading, in each place.
1.5.5.9	Both of you, O Indra and Agni, are invoked for gifts, both of you are to be praised together.
1.5.5.10	Both of you are givers of food and wealth, both of you I invoke for the attainment of strength.
1.5.5.11	This is your natural place, from which you were born and shone forth.
1.5.5.12	Knowing that, O Agni, mount it and increase our wealth.
1.5.5.13	O Agni, you purify the life-forces, bestow wealth and food on us.
1.5.5.14	O Agni, restrain the wicked ones.
1.5.5.15	O Agni, flow forth with your own power, bestowing radiance and great prosperity upon us.
1.5.5.16	Bestowing nourishment and wealth upon me.
1.5.5.17	O Agni Pavaka, with your shining, gentle, divine tongue,
1.5.5.18	Do you bring the gods and do you worship them.
1.5.5.19	O Agni Pāvaka, shining brightly, bring the gods here for us.
1.5.5.20	Come to our sacrifice and our oblation.
1.5.5.21	Agni is the most pure of pure vows, the pure Brahman, the pure sage.
1.5.5.22	The pure one shines when offered.
1.5.5.23	The pure ones, your bright ones, shine forth, O Agni.
1.5.5.24	Your lights are your offerings.
1.5.5.25	O Agni, you are the giver of life.
1.5.5.26	Give me life.
1.5.5.27	O Agni you are the giver or radiance.
1.5.5.28	Give me radiance.
1.5.5.29	O Agni! You are the protector of the body.
1.5.5.30-36	Protect me from my own body. O Agni, whatever is deficient in my body, that do thou fill up for me. O Citravasa, may you attain the auspicious end. O Agni the kindler, we kindle thee with a hundred bright flames. Those who are endowed with brilliance and have created brilliance, those who are endowed with fame and have created fame, those who have good heroes and are invincible, O Agni, the destroyer of enemies, on the highest heaven,
1.5.5.37	May you be united with the radiance of Agni, with the praise of the sages, with the beloved abode.
1.5.5.38	You are Agni, with the radiance of the sun.
1.5.5.39	May you unite me with life, radiance, and progeny.
1.5.6.1	I see all the offspring, born from Idā, the human ones.
1.5.6.2	May they all be in our house.
1.5.6.3	Be water.
1.5.6.4	May you eat water.
1.5.6.5	Be great.
1.5.6.6	May you have great food.
1.5.6.7	Be together.
1.5.6.8	May you have food together.
1.5.6.9	Be strength.
1.5.6.10	May you be nourished with strength.
1.5.6.11	Be happy in this world, in this herd, in this pasture, in this womb.
1.5.6.12	Do not go away from here.
1.5.6.13	May I have many.
1.5.6.14	You are the collection of all forms.
1.5.6.15	Come to me with strength, with the protection of cattle, with the nourishment of wealth.
1.5.6.16	May I be your thousand-nourisher.
1.5.6.17	May your wealth be established in me.
1.5.6.18	To you, O Agni, day by day, we come with praise, with our thoughts.
1.5.6.19	We bring you homage.
1.5.6.20	The shining one, the protector of sacrifices, the illuminator of truth,
1.5.6.21	Growing in his own abode,
1.5.6.22	He, like a father to his son, O Agni, be a good helper to us.
1.5.6.23	Do thou protect us for welfare.
1.5.6.24	O Agni, thou art our protector and saviour, be thou auspicious and friendly.
1.5.6.25	We now invoke thee, O most shining one, for our friends' sake.
1.5.6.26	Agni is wealth, the bestower of wealth, the most brilliant, the giver of wealth.
1.5.6.27	I see you with energy.
1.5.6.28	May you see me with energy.
1.5.6.29	I see you with the prosperity of wealth.
1.5.6.30	May you see me with the prosperity of riches.
1.5.6.31	O Ida, you are the maker of honey.
1.5.6.32	May your joy enter me.
1.5.6.33	May I prosper with a thousandfold prosperity for you.
1.5.6.34	May your wealth be established in me.
1.5.6.35	We meditate on the excellent radiance of Savitar, the divine one,
1.5.6.36	Whose inspiration is in our minds.
1.5.6.37-42	O Soma, make the Brahman-lord resound. O Indra, the son of Kakshivat, You are never stingy, O Indra, you give to the one who offers. Do you come near, O generous one? Your gift is sought by the god. We approach you, O Agni, the wise, the protector, The tawny-colored one, the breaker, the breaker of the hard-to-break, Every day.
1.5.7.2	"They approach the sacrifice."
1.5.7.3	He says.
1.5.7.4	He yokes him to the praise.
1.5.7.5	He approaches.
1.5.7.6	He says. (The sacrificer)
1.5.7.7	approaches this world with offspring and cattle.
1.5.7.8	He approaches this world with offspring, cattle.
1.5.7.9	"Following his ancient radiance."
1.5.7.10	He says,
1.5.7.11	The ancient world is heaven.
1.5.7.12	He ascends heaven.
1.5.7.13	Agni is the head of heaven, the crest.
1.5.7.14	He says:
1.5.7.15	He makes him the head of those who are equal.
1.5.7.16	And indeed he stands in the human world from the divine world.
1.5.7.17	This one here first came with the creators.
1.5.7.18	He says.
1.5.7.19	He makes him principal.
1.5.7.20	Both of you, O Indra and Agni, are invoked.
1.5.7.21	He says.
1.5.7.22	He obtains strength and power.
1.5.7.23	"He says, "This is your natural place."
1.5.7.24	" He says,
1.5.7.25	Cattle are wealth.
1.5.7.26	He obtains cattle.
1.5.7.27	He approaches with six (verses).
1.5.7.28	There are six seasons.
1.5.7.29	He stands in the seasons.
1.5.7.30	He approaches the northern ones with six (verses),
1.5.7.31	They amount to twelve.
1.5.7.32	Twelve months are a year.
1.5.7.33	He stands firm in the year itself.
1.5.7.34	Just as a man, a horse, a cow grows old, so does the Agni installed grow old.
1.5.7.35	After the year, he stands firm with the Agnipavamānī verses.
1.5.7.36	He makes it new and ageless again.
1.5.7.37	And he purifies it.
1.5.7.38	He stands firmly.
1.5.7.39-48	This is his Yoga. This is his self-control. This is the begging of him. Just as one who is worse than another, having obtained something better, bows down, so it is. "O Agni, you are the giver of life." "Give me life," he says. He says this because Agni is indeed the giver of life. "O Agn, you are the Giver of Light." "Give light to me," he says.
1.5.7.49	He says:
1.5.7.50	"You are the one who gives radiance."
1.5.7.51	"You are Agni, the protector of the body."
1.5.7.52	"Protect my body."
1.5.7.53	He says:
1.5.7.54	"Indeed, you are the protector of the bodies."
1.5.7.55	"O Agni, whatever is deficient in my body, fill that for me."
1.5.7.56	He says
1.5.7.57	"Whatever is deficient in my offspring and cattle, fill that for my me."
1.5.7.58	He indeed says this.
1.5.7.59	"O Agni with the variegated garment, may I attain your auspicious end."
1.5.7.60	He says:
1.5.7.61	Night is Citrāvasu.
1.5.7.62	Brahmins used to be afraid of her before dawn.
1.5.7.63	He indeed secures dawn.
1.5.7.64	"He says: "The kindlers, a hundred winters."
1.5.7.65	He says:
1.5.7.66	Man has a hundred years and a hundred senses."
1.5.7.67	He indeed stands in life and senses.
1.5.7.68	This is the Sūrmi with the ear-shaped (verse).
1.5.7.69	By means of this (kindling-stick) the gods overcame the Asuras in a hundred battles.
1.5.7.70	When he lays down the kindling-stick with this (verse),
1.5.7.71	he hurls the thunderbolt, the hundred-killer, against his foe.
1.5.7.72	For covering.
1.5.7.73	The Acchambatka.
1.5.7.74	"Thou hast reached the lustre of the sun,"
1.5.7.75	he says.
1.5.8.6	"These are waters."
1.5.8.7	"May we eat the great ones."
1.5.8.8	He says:
1.5.8.9	"These are great."
1.5.8.10	"May you eat the strong ones."
1.5.8.11	He say:
1.5.8.12	"These strong ones."
1.5.8.13	"May ye eat the strong ones"
1.5.8.14	He says: "These are strong."
1.5.8.15	"May the strong ones eat the strong ones,"
1.5.8.16	He says: These are strong.
1.5.8.17	"May ye rejoice in the Revatī."
1.5.8.18	He says, "The Revatī are cattle."
1.5.8.19	He delights the animals in himself.
1.5.8.20	"Here only, do not go away."
1.5.8.21	He says.
1.5.8.22	He makes them firm and unmoving.
1.5.8.23	One Agni is made of bricks, another of animals.
1.5.8.24	"You are the union, the one of all forms."
1.5.8.25	He touches the calf.
1.5.8.26	He takes it up.
1.5.8.27	He makes it animal-like.
1.5.8.28	He indeed falls away from this world who approaches the Ahavaniya.
1.5.8.29	He approaches the Garhapatya.
1.5.8.30	He stands in this world.
1.5.8.31	And he also sacrifices to the Garhapaty.
1.5.8.32	He approaches with Gayatri verses.
1.5.8.33	Gayatri is indeed brilliance.
1.5.8.34	He places brilliance in himself.
1.5.8.35	And because he recites this verse.
1.5.8.36-45	For continuity. The Garhapatya is indeed the two-footed ones, the heroes are born from it. He who, knowing this, approaches the Garhapatya with two-footed verses, a hero is born to him. "I see you with energy." "May you see me with energy." He says. He indeed bestows this blessing. "He says, 'The most desirable of Savitar.' He says. For prosperity.
1.5.8.46	"Soma, the sweet-sounding one."
1.5.8.47	He says:
1.5.8.48	"He indeed secures the drinking of Soma."
1.5.8.49	"Do thou, O lord of Brahman, make."
1.5.8.50	He says
1.5.8.51	"For prosperity."
1.5.8.52	"Soma, the sweet sounding one."
1.5.8.53	He say:
1.5.8.54	"He secures the drinking of soma."
1.5.8.55	"Do you, O lord of Brahmans, make."
1.5.8.56	he says:
1.5.8.57	"Brahmavarchas alone secures."
1.5.8.58	"Never does he sleep in the forest."
1.5.8.59	He says:
1.5.8.60	"He who, knowing thus, worships Agni, never sleeps in the forest." He says:
1.5.8.61	"We have come to thy house, O Agni."
1.5.8.62	He says
1.5.8.63	He places him in the enclosure.
1.5.8.64	For non-falling.
1.5.8.65	"O Agni, the householder."
1.5.8.66	He says.
1.5.8.67	It is as per the Yajus.
1.5.8.68	"A hundred snows."
1.5.8.69	He says.
1.5.8.70	"May I kindle thee for a hundred winters."
1.5.8.71	He indeed says this.
1.5.8.72	He takes the name of the son.
1.5.8.73	He makes him a food-eater.
1.5.8.74	He should say, "May I obtain that blessing for my son, the luminous one."
1.5.8.75	One whose son is not born should say this.
1.5.8.76	His son is born as brilliant and endowed with brahminical splendour.
1.5.8.77	He should recite this benediction for him: "May he be luminous."
1.5.8.78	He should say this to one whose son has been born.
1.5.8.79	He places radiance and brilliance in him.
1.5.9.1	He offers the Agnihotra.
1.5.9.2	Whatever belongs to the sacrificer, that is his.
1.5.9.3	He sprinkles semen for procreation.
1.5.9.4	For Agni is indeed procreation.
1.5.9.5	Then he burns the herbs that are within.
1.5.9.6	They grow more abundantly from that.
1.5.9.7	When he offers in the evening,
1.5.9.8	he sprinkles semen.
1.5.9.9	He generates it with the morning offering.
1.5.9.10	The sprinkled semen, not yet transformed by Tvashtri, grows.
1.5.9.11	As long as Tvashtri transforms the forms of the sprinkled semen, so long does it grow.
1.5.9.12	This indeed is the divine Tvashtri, he who offers sacrifice.
1.5.9.13	He approaches with many (offerings).
1.5.9.14	He creates many forms of the semen that has been deposited.
1.5.9.15	He is born as that (semen).
1.5.9.16	He who, knowing this, approaches Agni, becomes greater and greater every day.
1.5.9.17	The day was of the gods, the night of the Asuras.
1.5.9.18	The Asuras, when they had become the wealth of the gods, entered the night with them.
1.5.9.19	The gods, being deprived of it, thought:
1.5.9.20	They saw:
1.5.9.21	"The night is Agni's, the cattle are Agni's. Let us praise Agni, he, when praised, will again give us the cattle."
1.5.9.22	They praised Agni:
1.5.9.23	He, being praised by them, brought the animals from the night to the day.
1.5.9.24	The gods, having found the animals, made their desires.
1.5.9.25	He who, knowing this, approaches Agni, becomes possessed of cattle.
1.5.9.26	The sun indeed went from this world to that world.
1.5.9.27	Having gone to that world, he again approached this world.
1.5.9.28	Having come to this world, he was afraid of death.
1.5.9.29	For this world is indeed associated with death.
1.5.9.30	He thought,
1.5.9.31	"I will praise this very Agni. He, being praised, will lead me to the heavenly world."
1.5.9.32	He praised Agni.
1.5.9.33	Being praised, he led him to the heavenly world.
1.5.9.34	He who, knowing this, worships Agni, indeed goes to the heavenly world, and attains the whole of his life.
1.5.9.35	He who worships Agni indeed ascends him.
1.5.9.36	As one who has ascended the better one does what he wishes.
1.5.9.37	He worships at night, not in the morning.
1.5.9.38	For the vows are prescribed at night.
1.5.9.39	He is equal to the good and the bad.
1.5.9.40	The light is Agni.
1.5.9.41	Darkness is the night.
1.5.9.42	When one stands in the night,
1.5.9.43	one crosses darkness with light.
1.5.9.44	One should approach Agni.
1.5.9.45	They say:
1.5.9.46	One who approaches a human being every day and then asks for it, he indeed approaches him.
1.5.9.47	Then who will beg the gods every day?
1.5.9.48	Therefore, he should not be approached.
1.5.9.49	But they also say:
1.5.9.50	"One who performs a sacrifice for a blessing, for whom does he perform the sacrifice?"
1.5.9.51	This indeed is the blessing of one who has established the fire, that he approaches the fire.
1.5.9.52	Therefore, he may be approached.
1.5.9.53	Prajapati created the animals.
1.5.9.54	Those created entered the day and night.
1.5.9.55	He found them with the metres.
1.5.9.56	When one worships with the metres, one desires one's own.
1.5.9.57	They say that there is no death for him who worships daily.
1.5.9.58	He who worships Agni from the side, he approaches him.
1.5.9.59	He who goes beyond and above with offspring and cattle,
1.5.9.60	he stands like a horse,
1.5.9.61	he does not go beyond and above with cattle and offspring.
1.6.7.1	Just as the Soma sacrifices are well-known, so also these sacrifices are well- known, namely the New and Full Moon sacrifices.
1.6.7.2	Whose sacrifice do the gods come to? Whose do they not come to?
1.6.7.3	The one who takes possession of the deities first among many sacrificers, he sacrifices to them on the next day.
1.6.7.4	This is indeed the abode of the gods, namely the Āhavanīya.
1.6.7.5	The Antaratīya fire is of the animals.
1.6.7.6	The Garhapatya fire is of men.
1.6.7.7	The Anvāhāryapacaniya fire is of the ancestors.
1.6.7.8	One takes possession of the fire.
1.6.7.9	The deities themselves protect him in his own abode.
1.6.7.10	He performs the sacrifice on the next day.
1.6.7.11	The Agni who is worthy of sacrifice through the vow, is the lord of vows.
1.6.7.12	The Brahman is the upholder of the vow.
1.6.7.13	One who is about to undertake the vow should say:
1.6.7.14	"O Agni, lord of vows, I shall observe the vow."
1.6.7.15	Agni is the lord of the vows of the gods.
1.6.7.16	Therefore, having been addressed thus, one obtains the vow.
1.6.7.17	One undertakes the vow at the Full Moon with a sacrificial grass.
1.6.7.18	At the New Moon with calves.
1.6.7.19	Because this is their abode.
1.6.7.20	Having spread out, the fire is in front and behind.
1.6.7.21	They say:
1.6.7.22	"The humans indeed desire what is spread out. What about the gods whose abode is new?"
1.6.7.23	The deities dwell in him who knows this, and who strews the fire when about to perform a sacrifice.
1.6.7.24	The sacrificer should restrain both the domestic and wild animals.
1.6.7.25	They say:
1.6.7.26	If he fasts for the domestic animals,
1.6.7.27	he restrains the domestic animals.
1.6.7.28	If he eats of the wild animals,
1.6.7.29	he does so for the wild animals.
1.6.7.30	If one were to fast without eating, it would be dedicated to the Pitrs.
1.6.7.31	One eats from the forest.
1.6.7.32	The forest is the power.
1.6.7.33	One places power within oneself.
1.6.7.34	If one were to fast, one would be hungry.
1.6.7.35	If one ate, Rudra would think of one's cattle.
1.6.7.36	One eats water.
1.6.7.37	That is neither eaten nor not eaten.
1.6.7.38	He does not become hungry.
1.6.7.39	Rudra does not take his cattle.
1.6.7.40	The sacrifice is indeed a thunderbolt.
1.6.7.41	Hunger is indeed the enemy of man.
1.6.7.42	When one fasts without eating.
1.6.7.43	He directly destroys hunger, the enemy, with the thunderbolt.
1.6.8.1	He who performs a sacrifice without faith, they do not give him what he desires.
1.6.8.2	He offers water.
1.6.8.3	Water is faith.
1.6.8.4	He performs the sacrifice with faith as the basis.
1.6.8.5	Both gods and men have faith in him for the purpose of being worshipped.
1.6.8.6	They say:
1.6.8.7	They indeed go beyond Vritra.
1.6.8.8	The mind indeed goes beyond speech.
1.6.8.9	They do not go beyond.
1.6.8.10	He offers water with mind.
1.6.8.11	This indeed is the mind.
1.6.8.12	He leads them by means of this (verse).
1.6.8.13	He whose oblation is not spilt, knows this.
1.6.8.14	He collects the sacrificial implements.
1.6.8.15	The sacrificial implements are indeed the sacrifice.
1.6.8.16	He thus collects the sacrifice.
1.6.8.17	If he were to collect them one by one, they would be connected with the Pitrs.
1.6.8.18	If together, they would be human.
1.6.8.19	He collects them two by two.
1.6.8.20	He makes the form of the Yajya and Anuvakya verses.
1.6.8.21-25	Then indeed it is a pair. He who knows the ten implements of sacrifice, his sacrifice is well-formed from the mouth. The wooden sword, the skull, the Agnihotra ladle, the broom, the black antelope skin, the pestle, the mortar, the pestle and the stone. These are the ten implements of the sacrifice. He who thus knows, his sacrifice is formed from the mouth.
1.6.8.26	He who offers sacrifice after having invited the gods, the gods accept his oblation.
1.6.8.27	When the oblation is being offered, one should recite this verse:
1.6.8.28	"We invoke Agni, the Hotar, here."
1.6.8.29	He offers sacrifice after having invoked the gods.
1.6.8.30	The gods accept his oblations.
1.6.8.31	This is indeed the grasping of the sacrifice.
1.6.8.32	Having grasped, he offers sacrifice.
1.6.8.33	Having uttered that, he restrains speech.
1.6.8.34	For the stability of the sacrifice.
1.6.8.35	Then indeed Prajapati created the sacrifice with the mind.
1.6.8.36	He creates that sacrifice with the mind itself.
1.6.8.37	For the non-pervasion of Rakshas.
1.6.8.38	He who yokes the sacrifice when it has come to the yoke, yokes it in the yoking.
1.6.8.39	"Who yokes you? May he who yokes you, yoke you."
1.6.8.40	He says.
1.6.8.41	Prajapati indeed is who.
1.6.8.42	Prajapati himself yokes him, yokes him in the yoking.
1.6.9.1	Prajapati created the sacrifices: Agnihotra, Agnistoma, Full Moon, Ukthya, New Moon, and Atiratra.
1.6.9.2	He measured them out.
1.6.9.3	As much as the Agnihotra was, so much was the Agnistoma;
1.6.9.4	The Utkhya is as long as the full moon.
1.6.9.5	The Atiratra is as long as a new moon.
1.6.9.6	One who knows this and offers the Agnihotra attains as much as one attains by the Agnistoma.
1.6.9.7	One who, knowing this, performs the full moon sacrifice attains as much as by the Utkhya.
1.6.9.8-13	He who knowing thus performs the New-moon sacrifice, attains as much as one attains by the Atiratra. This indeed was the sacrifice of Prajapati, the foremost. By it he attained the highest state. By it Prajapati attained the highest state, By it Indra attained the highest state.
1.6.9.14-19	By that Indra attained the highest degree. By that he removed Agni and Soma from the house. By that Agni and Soma attained the highest degree.
1.6.9.20	The twelve pairs are in the Darsha-Pūrnamāsa sacrifices.
1.6.9.21	They should be accomplished.
1.6.9.22	They say:
1.6.9.23	He releases the calf.
1.6.9.24	He places the pot.
1.6.9.25	He cuts (the animal).
1.6.9.26	He strikes the two stones together.
1.6.9.27	He pours (the fat) on (the stones).
1.6.9.28	He places the skull.
1.6.9.29	He places (the cake) on the pot.
1.6.9.30	And the ghee.
1.6.9.31	He carries the Stambayajus.
1.6.9.32	And he takes up (the Soma).
1.6.9.33	And he encloses the altar.
1.6.9.34	And he yokes the wife.
1.6.9.35	And he places the Prokṣaṇī water.
1.6.9.36	And the clarified butter.
1.6.9.37	These are the twelve pairs in the Darsha-Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices.
1.6.9.38	He who performs them and offers sacrifice, offers sacrifice with a progeny, and is born with progeny, cattle and pairs.
1.6.10.1	You are firm.
1.6.10.2	"May I be the most firm among my kinsmen."
1.6.10.3	He says:
1.6.10.4	"May I be the firmest among them."
1.6.10.5	"You are fierce."
1.6.10.6	"May I become the fiercest among my kinsmen," he says:
1.6.10.7	"I am the fiercest among them."
1.6.10.8	He says, "May I be invincible among them."
1.6.10.9	You are the conqueror.
1.6.10.10	"May I conquer among my kinsmen." He says:
1.6.10.11	"He says, "I am the conqueror among them."
1.6.10.12	He who has kindled it for him, he worships.
1.6.10.13	He says, "I yoke thee with divine Brahman."
1.6.10.14	He says this.
1.6.10.15	This is indeed the union of Agni.
1.6.10.16	By means of that he yokes him.
1.6.10.17	The gods went to the heavenly world by the prosperity of the sacrifice.
1.6.10.18	By the adversity of the sacrifice, they overpowered the Asuras.
1.6.10.19	If my Agni should injure this sacrifice,"
1.6.10.20	He says,
1.6.10.21	The sacrificer goes to the heavenly world by the prosperity of the sacrifice.
1.6.10.22	By the decay of the sacrifice, he overcomes his enemies.
1.6.10.23	One should offer the Agnihotra with these Vyāhṛtis.
1.6.10.24	The Agnihotra is the face of the sacrifice, and these Vyāhṛti are Brahman.
1.6.10.25	He makes Brahman the very face of the sacrifice.
1.6.10.26	If the year has passed, he should offer them with these (verses).
1.6.10.27	He thus takes possession of the year on both sides with Brahman.
1.6.10.28	One who is performing the Darsa-Paurnamasa and Catu-r-masya sacrifices should offer the oblations with these Vyahrtis.
1.6.10.29	The Darsa-Pūrnamāsa and Catu-rmāsyas are the mouth of the sacrifice, and these Vyahrtis are Brahman.
1.6.10.30	The Brahman himself performs the sacrifice at the mouth of the sacrifice.
1.6.10.31	When the year is over, he should offer with these (verses).
1.6.10.32	He takes the year on both sides with the Brahman himself.
1.6.10.33	Whatever is done with the song of the sacrifice, the prosperity of the sacrifice goes to the kingdom.
1.6.10.34	If it is done with a verse, the prosperity of sacrifice goes to the clan.
1.6.10.35	Then the Brahman performs a sacrifice without prosperity.
1.6.10.36	One who is about to recite the Sāmidhenī verses should place these Vyāhṛtis before them.
1.6.10.37	He makes Brahma the first step.
1.6.10.38	Thus the Brahman performs the sacrifice with blessings.
1.6.10.39	If one desires that the sacrificer
1.6.10.40	should be his enemy,
1.6.10.41	one should place these Vyāhrtis before the Puronuvākyā for him.
1.6.10.42	The Puronuvākyā is dedicated to the deity of the enemy.
1.6.10.43	The enemy's share of the sacrifice goes to him.
1.6.10.44	If one wishes that the sacrificers
1.6.10.45	should go to the share of the sacrifice,
1.6.10.46	then one should place one half of the Puronuvākyatīka for them, one before the Yajyātīka and one before the Yājyā.
1.6.10.47	and the same way, the blessings of the sacrifice go to him.
1.6.10.48	Just as Parjanya showers well, so the sacrifice showers on the sacrificer.
1.6.10.49	They take up the water from the pits.
1.6.10.50	The sacrificer takes up the sacrifice with blessings.
1.6.10.51	You are the mind, belonging to Prajapati.
1.6.10.52	May I enter with the mind.
1.6.10.53	He says:
1.6.10.54	The mind belongs to Prajapati.
1.6.11.2-12	"Let us listen." It has four syllables. "Let us listen." It has four syllables. "Let us listen to the Veda." It has two syllables. "We offer." It has five syllables. "The Vasat call has two syllables." This indeed is the seventeenfold Prajapati, dependent on the sacrifice. He who knows this stands firm through the sacrifice and does not fall away from the sacrifice.
1.6.11.13-18	He who knows the departure, the foundation, and the ascent of the sacrifice, goes to the end with a well-established, unerring sacrifice. "Let him call out, 'Let us hear!' 'Let us listen!' 'Let us sacrifice!' 'Let us offer!' 'Let us praise!' 'Let us recite!' 'Let us invoke!' 'Let us pray!' 'Let us worship!' 'Let us give!' 'Let us be blessed!' 'Let us bless!' 'Let us say!' 'Let us proclaim!' 'Let us chant!' 'Let us sing!' 'Let us rejoice!' 'Let us enjoy!' 'Let us make offerings!' 'Let us perform!' 'Let us accomplish!' 'Let us succeed!' 'Let us prosper!' 'Let us attain!' 'Let us obtain!' 'Let us gain!' 'Let us win!' 'Let us conquer!' 'Let us overcome!' 'Let us vanquish!' 'Let us destroy!' 'Let us consume!' 'Let us eat!' 'Let us drink!' 'Let us taste!' 'Let us touch!' 'Let us feel!' 'Let us know!' 'Let us understand!' 'Let us remember!' 'Let us recollect!' 'Let us recall!' 'Let us think!' 'Let us reflect!' 'Let us meditate!' 'Let us contemplate!' 'Let us visualize!' 'Let us imagine!' 'Let us conceive!' 'Let us believe!' 'Let us have faith!' 'Let us trust!' 'Let us hope!' 'Let us aspire!' 'Let us desire!' 'Let us wish!' 'Let us will!' 'Let us intend!' 'Let us resolve!' 'Let us
1.6.11.19	He who knows the milking of truth, milks it indeed.
1.6.11.20	Truth is indeed the sacrifice.
1.6.11.21	"He calls out, "Let it be heard!"
1.6.11.22	He calls it out.
1.6.11.23	"Let it be heard," he says."
1.6.11.24	"Let it (be offered)," he says." He offers.
1.6.11.25	"He says, "Let us offer."
1.6.11.26	He approaches.
1.6.11.27	"He offers, saying, "Let us sacrifice."
1.6.11.28	He approaches for the Vasat-utterance.
1.6.11.29	This is indeed the milking of truth.
1.6.11.30	He who knows thus, indeed, milks her.
1.6.11.31	The gods were performing a sacrifice.
1.6.11.32	They stole their directions.
1.6.11.33	They saw this moist five-fold (verse).
1.6.11.34	"Let them be called."
1.6.11.35	They generated a wind in front.
1.6.11.36	"Let them hear."
1.6.11.37	They flooded with clouds.
1.6.11.38	"Let us sacrifice."
1.6.11.39	They generated lightning.
1.6.11.40	"Let (the gods) sacrifice."
1.6.11.41	They caused rain.
1.6.11.42	They made the sun go down with the Vasat-call.
1.6.11.43	Then they reached the directions from there.
1.6.11.44	He who knows this, the directions reach him.
1.6.11.45	You know Prajapati, Prajapati knows you.
1.6.11.46	He who is known by Prajapati becomes auspicious.
1.6.11.47	This is indeed the Prajapati of the Vedas. Let him be heard. Let him say "Yes". Let him sacrifice. Let us sacrifice. The Vasat-call.
1.6.11.48	He who knows thus becomes blessed.
1.6.11.49	"He says, "I delight the spring among the seasons."
1.6.11.50	He says,
1.6.11.51	"The Prajapas are indeed the seasons."
1.6.11.52	He delights the seasons.
1.6.11.53	They, being delighted, arrange themselves as before.
1.6.11.54	The seasons arrange themselves for him who knows thus.
1.6.11.55	"He (the sacrificer) says, "By offering to Agni and Soma, may I become one with sight."
1.6.11.56	He says:
1.6.11.57	The sacrifice is endowed with eyes through Agni and Soma.
1.6.11.58	He indeed bestows eyes upon himself through them.
1.6.11.59	"May I be the eater of food through Agni's divine worship."
1.6.11.60	He says:
1.6.11.61	Agni is the eater of food among the gods.
1.6.11.62	He indeed confers food upon himself through him.
1.6.11.63	You are the giver.
1.6.11.64	May I be undaunted, may I conquer him."
1.6.11.65	He says:
1.6.11.66	"By this very conquest, the gods conquered the Asuras."
1.6.11.67	By the same (conquest) one conquers one's enemy.
1.6.11.68	"By the sacrifice to Agni and Soma, may I be the slayer of Vrtra."
1.6.11.69	He says
1.6.11.70	Indra slew Vritra by Agni and Soma.
1.6.11.71	He conquers his enemies by means of these two.
1.6.11.72	"He says, "By Indra and Agni I am the eater of food."
1.6.11.73	He says, "I am the eater of Indra."
1.6.11.74	He becomes the eater of Indra.
1.6.11.75	"He (the sacrificer) says, "By the sacrifice to Indra I am the eater."
1.6.11.76	He says,"
1.6.11.77	"He becomes the eater."
1.6.11.78	I go to the greatness of the great Indra through the sacrifice to the gods."
1.6.11.79	He says:
1.6.11.80	One goes to the greatness of Indra alone.
1.6.11.81	"I go to the life and stability through the sacrifice to Agni Sviṣṭakṛt."
1.6.11.82	He says
1.6.11.83	One places life in oneself.
1.6.11.84	One stands firm through the sacrifice.
1.7.1.1	The animals of the householder who has performed the Pākayajña stand up.
1.7.1.2	Indeed, Iḍā is the Pākayagña.
1.7.1.3	It is suspended between the Prayāja and Anūyāja offerings in the world of the sacrificer.
1.7.1.4	One should recite this verse over the Iḍā as it is being brought: "Come, O beautiful, come, O tawny-coloured."
1.7.1.5	Indeed, Iḷā is animals.
1.7.1.6	He invites animals.
1.7.1.7	The gods milked the sacrifice.
1.7.1.8	The sacrifice milked the Asuras.
1.7.1.9	Those Asuras who were milked by the sacrifice were defeated.
1.7.1.10	He who knows the milking of the sacrifice and performs the sacrifice, even another sacrificer is milked.
1.7.1.11	May this be my true blessing of this sacrifice."
1.7.1.12	He says.
1.7.1.13	This indeed is the milking of the sacrfice.
1.7.1.14	By that alone he milks it.
1.7.1.15	The cow that has been given away gives milk.
1.7.1.16	The cow that has been offered gives milk to the sacrificer.
1.7.1.17	These are the two breasts of Ida.
1.7.1.18	"One should call out, "Ida is invoked."
1.7.1.19	Vayu is the calf.
1.7.1.20	When the Hotri calls out Ida, then the sacrificer, looking at the Hotri, should mentally contemplate Vayu.
1.7.1.21	He releases the calf to its mother.
1.7.1.22	The gods went to the heavenly world with the entire sacrifice.
1.7.1.23	Manu performed the Paakayajna.
1.7.1.24	Seda turned to Manu.
1.7.1.25	The gods and the demons challenged her, the gods to the west, the demons to the east.
1.7.1.26	She turned to the gods.
1.7.1.27	The cattle chose the gods.
1.7.1.28	They drove away the cattle from the demons.
1.7.1.29	If one desires:
1.7.1.30	"He should be without cattle."
1.7.1.31-38	He should call the Ida of the opposite direction. They become without cattle. If one desires: "He should call the Ida in the opposite direction. He becomes with cattle." Brahmin scholars say: "One should call the Ida who calls the Ida, to himself in the Ida."
1.7.1.39	May she, our beloved, the bountiful, the generous, be gracious to us.
1.7.1.40	He says:
1.7.1.41	One should call out to Ida and then call oneself in Ida.
1.7.1.42	The sacrifice is as if divided when it is Ida.
1.7.1.43	They eat with the Sama and they cleanse with the Sama.
1.7.1.44	The sacrifice of the Asuras was cut off here.
1.7.1.45	The gods restored it with Brahma.
1.7.1.46	Brihaspati has made this sacrifice of ours firm.
1.7.1.47	He says:
1.7.1.48	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman among the gods.
1.7.1.49	He indeed establishes the sacrifice with Brahman.
1.7.1.50	May he establish this broken sacrifice.
1.7.1.51	He says.
1.7.1.52	For continuity.
1.7.1.53	May all the gods rejoice here.
1.7.1.54	He says,
1.7.1.55	He indeed directs the sacrifice to the gods through continuity.
1.7.1.56-61	The cattle follow the sacrificial gift that is given at a sacrifice. He who sacrifices without cattle becomes poor. They say, "It is the duty of the sacrificer to do that which is done for the gods, so that he may delight in his cattle." He says, "O Brahman, expand!" The sacrifice is Brahman.
1.7.2.2	"What is the name of the Ida that you have called out?"
1.7.2.3	He said, "Call her out." "She who supports the gods with Prāṇa, men with Vyāna, and the ancestors with Apāna."
1.7.2.4	"Does she cut?" "No, she does not cut."
1.7.2.5	"She cuts."
1.7.2.6	He said:
1.7.2.7	"You have called out her body." He said:
1.7.2.8	"Her body is a cow.
1.7.2.9	The cows indeed said this to them.
1.7.2.10	The one that is given at a sacrifice, that sustains the gods through the prāṇa.
1.7.2.11	The one by which men live, that sustains men through the vyāna.
1.7.2.12	The one which they offer to the fathers, that sustains the fathers through the apāna.
1.7.2.13	He who knows this becomes possessed of cattle.
1.7.2.14	Then he said, "Indeed, that is the call," and he said, "The one by which the offspring are born and return."
1.7.2.15	He said, "This is her food."
1.7.2.16	Her food is the plants.
1.7.2.17	Plants are the offspring of Praja. They follow the offspring that are going to be born and take them back.
1.7.2.18	He who knows this becomes a giver.
1.7.2.19	He said, "She is the one who is called upon. She is the one who takes the offspring that are about to be born and takes them back."
1.7.2.20	"This is his support," he said.
1.7.2.21	This is his support.
1.7.2.22	This (earth) takes in the creatures when they are falling away.
1.7.2.23	It takes them in when they are falling back.
1.7.2.24	He who knows this stands firm.
1.7.2.25	"And he said, 'One should call her by the name of that in whose step the creatures drink the ghee when they are reviving.'
1.7.2.26	She cuts, but she does not cut.'
1.7.2.27	He said, 'She does not cut, but she generates.'
1.7.2.28	He said: 'This is the one who calls out to Ida.'
1.7.2.29	Ida is indeed rain.
1.7.2.30	For rain, when it falls, the creatures drink the ghee that revives them.
1.7.2.31	He who knows this is born and becomes a food-giver.
1.7.3.1	The other gods are worshipped at a distance.
1.7.3.2	Others are direct.
1.7.3.3	What he sacrifices.
1.7.3.4	He sacrifices to those very gods who are worshipped directly.
1.7.3.5	What he brings in as the Anvāhārya.
1.7.3.6	These very gods are directly the Brahmanas.
1.7.3.7	He pleases them with that.
1.7.3.8	And this is his own dakṣiṇā.
1.7.3.9	And he also fills up the gap in the sacrifice.
1.7.3.10	Whatever is cruel in the sacrifice, whatever is spoiled, that he brings back with the Anvāhārya.
1.7.3.11	That is why the Anvāhāryya is called Anvāhāryy.
1.7.3.12	The priests are indeed the messengers of the gods.
1.7.3.13	When he brings the Anvāhāryan,
1.7.3.14	he pleases the messengers of the Gods.
1.7.3.15	Prajapati assigned the sacrifices to the gods.
1.7.3.16	He became angry.
1.7.3.17	He saw this Anvähärya (cake) not offered.
1.7.3.18	He placed it in himself.
1.7.3.19	This Anvähäryya is indeed Prajapati.
1.7.3.20	He who knows this, for whom the Anvähäriya is offered, he indeed prospers Prajapati directly.
1.7.3.21	The offering is unlimited.
1.7.3.22	Prajapati is unlimited.
1.7.3.23	For the attainment of Prajapati.
1.7.3.24	The gods did at the sacrifice what the Asuras did not do.
1.7.3.25	The gods saw this Anvähärya belonging to Prajâpati.
1.7.3.26	They brought it.
1.7.3.27	Then the gods became victorious, the Asuras were defeated.
1.7.3.28	He who knows thus, and whose Anvähäryâ is brought, becomes victorious, his foe is defeated.
1.7.3.29	One who has performed sacrifice with cooked food becomes victorious.
1.7.3.30	He who knows thus, and for whom the Anvāhārya is brought, he alone is the fulfiller of desires.
1.7.3.31	"He says, 'Thou art the share of Prajapati.'
1.7.3.32	He says,
1.7.3.33	He unites Prajapati with the share.
1.7.3.34	"He is full of energy, full of milk."
1.7.3.35	He says, "
1.7.3.36	He places energy and milk in him.
1.7.3.37	"Protect my Prāṇa and Apāna.
1.7.3.38	"Protect me from the equal and the moving."
1.7.3.39	He says:
1.7.3.40	He indeed bestows a blessing.
1.7.3.41	"He says: "May you be inexhaustible, for the inexhaustible. May you not be exhausted for me in the other world, in the yonder world."
1.7.3.42	He says:
1.7.3.43	Food is exhausted in the yonder world.
1.7.3.44	For the offspring of this world live on what is given from here.
1.7.3.45	When he touches thus,
1.7.3.46	he indeed makes him go to the inexhaustible.
1.7.3.47	His food is not exhausted in this world or the next.
1.7.4.1	"He says, "By offering to the Barhiṣa deity, may I be endowed with offspring."
1.7.4.2	He says,
1.7.4.3	"Prajapati created offspring with the Barhiṣas."
1.7.4.4	He creates offspring with them.
1.7.4.5	"He (the sacrificer) says, "By performing the sacrifice to the Narāśaṃsa deity, may I become endowed with cattle."
1.7.4.6	He says,
1.7.4.7	Prajapati created animals with the Narasamsa.
1.7.4.8	He creates animals with the same.
1.7.4.9	"I am Agni Sviṣṭakṛt, I shall attain prosperity through the Yajna and the worship of the gods."
1.7.4.10	He says:
1.7.4.11	He places life in himself.
1.7.4.12	He stands firm through the Yajña.
1.7.4.13	The gods won the Ujjiti at the Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices.
1.7.4.14	By the New and Full Moon sacrifices, they drove away the Asuras.
1.7.4.15	"He says, "I follow the prosperity of Agni."
1.7.4.16	He says.
1.7.4.17	At the New and Full-Moon sacrifices, the sacrificer follows the prosperity of the deities.
1.7.4.18	By the New and Full moon sacrifices, he drives away his enemies.
1.7.4.19	He spreads out with the Vāja verses.
1.7.4.20	Food is indeed Vāja.
1.7.4.21	He indeed obtains food.
1.7.4.22	With two (verses).
1.7.4.23	For stability.
1.7.4.24	He who knows the two milkings of the sacrifice and performs the sacrifice, he milks the sacrifice from both sides, from the front and from above.
1.7.4.25	This is another milking of the sacrifice, the other in the Ida.
1.7.4.26	When the Hotṛ takes the name of the sacrificer, then he should say,
1.7.4.27	"These have come to the blessings, desiring to yield."
1.7.4.28	The deities are indeed praised when they yield.
1.7.4.29	And indeed the sacrifice is yielded from both sides, from the front and from above.
1.7.4.30	"May Agni, with the red one, lead the deity."
1.7.4.31	He says:
1.7.4.32	"These indeed are the divine horses.
1.7.4.33	The sacrificer is the sacrificial grass.
1.7.4.34	When he strikes the sacrificial grass with them,
1.7.4.35-43	The gods and the horse indeed lead the sacrificer to the heavenly world. I release your reins. Release the rays, he says. He says this. This is indeed the release of Agni. By that alone he releases him. I go to the firm foundation by the sacrifice of the god Vishnu, he says. He says this. Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
1.7.4.44	The sacrifice itself stands within.
1.7.4.45	"I shall be the seed of Soma through the worship of the gods."
1.7.4.46	He says:
1.7.4.47	Soma indeed is the seed-giver.
1.7.4.48	He himself places the seed in himself.
1.7.4.49	"I wish to increase the form of animals through the worship of Tvashtra."
1.7.4.50	He says
1.7.4.51	Tvashtra indeed is the creator of the forms of animals and their pairs.
1.7.4.52	By that very (fire) he assumes the form of the animals.
1.7.4.53	"The fire is the husband of the wives of the gods, the companion of the sacrifice. By the union of them, may I be prosperous by the union of the divine worship."
1.7.4.54	He says:
1.7.4.55	"From this union, indeed, Prajapati was born by the union.
1.7.4.56	Therefore, the sacrificer is born by the union.
1.7.4.57	You are the Veda.
1.7.4.58	You are the Veda, you are the Veda to be known."
1.7.4.59	He says:
1.7.4.60	"The gods found the Veda of the Asuras to be known by the Veda."
1.7.4.61	That is the Veda's Veda-ness.
1.7.4.62	Whatever one's enemy thinks of, one should take his name.
1.7.4.63	One takes away all that from him.
1.7.4.64	May the Veda bestow the horse, the one with ghee, the one with a family, the one with wealth, the one with thousands.
1.7.4.65	He says:
1.7.4.66	One obtains a thousand cattle.
1.7.4.67	One's offspring is born as a horse, he who knows this.
1.7.5.1	The sacrifice follows the firm one that is being offered.
1.7.5.2	The sacrifice the sacrificer.
1.7.5.3	The sacrificer the offspring.
1.7.5.4-12	The firm one, being nourished, the sacrifice follows and is nourished. The sacrifice, the sacrificer. The sacrificer, the offspring. May the firm one be nourished with ghee. He says. He nourishes the firm one. She, being nourished, follows and is nourished by the sacrifice. The sacrifice follows the sacrificer. The sacrificer follows the offspring.
1.7.5.13	The world of Prajapati is called Vibhan.
1.7.5.14	He places you in that, together with the sacrificer."
1.7.5.15	He says:
1.7.5.16	"This is indeed the world of Prajapater called Vibhan. 
1.7.5.17	He places him in that very world, together with the Sacrificer.
1.7.5.18	Indeed, when one performs a sacrifice, it is as if one is being cheated.
1.7.5.19	When one eats the share of the sacrificer,
1.7.5.20	One pleases oneself.
1.7.5.21-27	The sacrifice is as big as the share of the sacrificer. The sacrifice is the sacrificer. When he eats the share of the sacrifice, he establishes the sacrifice in the sacrifice. The sacrificial grass and water are indeed the Suyavasam. The altar is indeed the abode of the sacrificer, When he places the full vessel inside the altar,
1.7.5.28	He himself makes the offering of clarified butter with water in his own abode.
1.7.5.29	"You are good."
1.7.5.30	"May I be good."
1.7.5.31	He says:
1.7.5.32	"Water is indeed the sacrifice."
1.7.5.33	Water is the nectar.
1.7.5.34	He places the sacrifice and nectar within himself.
1.7.5.35	All beings follow one who undertakes a vow.
1.7.5.36	"The officiating priests of the gods purify in the eastern direction."
1.7.5.37	He says:
1.7.5.38	This is the final bath of the Darsha-Pūrnamāsa.
1.7.5.39	He goes to the final bath with those very beings who follow him when he undertakes the vow.
1.7.5.40	The gods, with Vishnu as their leader, conquered these worlds with the Vedas.
1.7.5.41	When one steps in the steps of Vishnu,
1.7.5.42	Having become Vishnu himself, the sacrificer conquers these worlds with the metres, unconquered.
1.7.5.43	This is Vishnu's step, the repeller of enemies.
1.7.5.44	He says:
1.7.5.45	The earth is indeed the Gāyatrī metre.
1.7.5.46	The sky is the Tristubh metre.
1.7.5.47	The heaven is the Jagatī metre.
1.7.5.48	The directions are the Anushtubh metre.
1.7.5.49	By the metres, he conquers these worlds in the proper order.
1.7.6.1-12	We have attained the Suva. "He says, "Suva has attained me." He says, "He goes to the world of heaven." "He says "May your heat not burn me." "He says "May your heat not injure me." He speaks as per the prescribed ritual. "He is the best of rays, you are the life-giver, "He says "Give me life."
1.7.6.13-17	He indeed is about to fall from this world, who steps in the steps of Vishnu. For the world of heaven are the steps of Vishnu stepped. Brahmin scholars say: "One should step in the steps of Vishņu, who having destroyed his enemies in these worlds, should return to this world."
1.7.6.18	This is the descent of this world.
1.7.6.19	When he says:
1.7.6.20	"I have this enemy from these directions and from this heaven."
1.7.6.21	He indeed makes his enemy enter these worlds and then descends again to this world.
1.7.6.22	"I have become united with light."
1.7.6.23	He says:
1.7.6.24	He indeed stands in this world.
1.7.6.25	He turns around the covering of Indra.
1.7.6.26	He says:
1.7.6.27	The sun is indeed Indra.
1.7.6.28	He turns around the covering (of the sun) itself.
1.7.6.29	He turns to the right.
1.7.6.30	He turns along his own power.
1.7.6.31	Therefore the right half of the body is more powerful.
1.7.6.32	And he turns along the covering of the sun itself.
1.7.6.33	I am united with offspring,
1.7.6.34	May I be with offspring.
1.7.6.35	He says:
1.7.6.36	He indeed bestows a blessing.
1.7.6.37	May the kindled Agni shine for me.
1.7.6.38	May I shine for you, O Agni, when kindled.
1.7.6.39	He says.
1.7.6.40	It is indeed as per the prescribed procedure.
1.7.6.41	The sacrifice is endowed with wealth.
1.7.6.42	May I be more wealthy.
1.7.6.43	He says
1.7.6.44	He indeed bestoows a blessing.
1.7.6.45	The Garhapatya is indeed performed at the end of many (sacrifices) as if mixed.
1.7.6.46	One approaches the Garhapatya with the Agnipariyamanī verses.
1.7.6.47	One purifies the fire.
1.7.6.48	One puripies oneself.
1.7.6.49	With two (verses).
1.7.6.50	For stability.
1.7.6.51	"One says, "O Agni, lord of the house..."
1.7.6.52	One says.
1.7.6.53	This is indeed according to the prescribed procedure.
1.7.6.54	"One (says), "A hundred snows..."
1.7.6.55	One (says).
1.7.6.56	"May I kindle thee for a hundred winters."
1.7.6.57	He indeed says this.
1.7.6.58	He takes the name of the son.
1.7.6.59	He makes him a food-eater.
1.7.6.60	He should say, "May I obtain that blessing for my son, the luminous one."
1.7.6.61	One whose son is not born should say this.
1.7.6.62	His son is born as brilliant and endowed with brahminical splendour.
1.7.6.63	I invoke that blessing for him, the one with light.
1.7.6.64	One should say this if a son is born to him.
1.7.6.65	He places radiance and brahminical splendor in him.
1.7.6.66	He who, having started a sacrifice, does not conclude it, becomes unstable.
1.7.6.67	"Who yokes you? May he release you."
1.7.6.68	He says:
1.7.6.69	Prajapati is the one.
1.7.6.70	He unites him with Prajapati, he releases him with Prajapति.
1.7.6.71	For stability.
1.7.6.72	Indeed, the rite not released by the lord burns.
1.7.6.73	"He says, "O Agni, lord of rites, I have observed the rite."
1.7.6.74	He says.
1.7.6.75	He releases the rite itself.
1.7.6.76	For peace.
1.7.6.77	For non-burning.
1.7.6.78	The sacrifice indeed goes away
1.7.6.79	and does not return again.
1.7.6.80	He who knows the re-establishment of the sacrifice and performs it, approaches it.
1.7.6.81	The sacrifice became.
1.7.6.82	He became.
1.7.6.83	He says.
1.7.6.84	This is indeed the re-establishment (of the sacrifice).
1.7.6.85	By means of that alone he re-establishes it.
1.7.6.86	One who has a fire but is not present at the assembly is not included in the Viraj.
1.7.6.87	Cattle are indeed the assembly of a brahmana.
1.7.6.88	Having worshipped, one should step forward and say:
1.7.6.89	"O Agni, may I be a cow-owner, a sheep-owner, and a horse-owner at the sacrifice."
1.7.6.90	One obtains a seat.
1.7.6.91	One attains a thousand animals.
1.7.6.92	A horse is born in one's progeny.
1.8.1.1	One offers the Puroḍāśa for Anumati.
1.8.1.2	A cow is the Dakṣiṇā.
1.8.1.3	Those who are united in friendship, they are the one-headed, one-footed Nirriti.
1.8.1.4	The Kumbhaṇḍa is the abode of the Kumbhaṇṭa.
1.8.1.5	The sacrifice is the offering to oneself.
1.8.1.6	You are the Nirriti of those.
1.8.1.7	You are Haviṣmatī, the one who has oblations.
1.8.1.8	We have been freed from this fear.
1.8.1.9	Obeisance to him who has created this.
1.8.1.10	He offers the oblation of rice to the sun.
1.8.1.11	The Varada Dakshina.
1.8.1.12	Agnivaishvadevam ekadashkapalam.
1.8.1.13	Vamanah vahni dakshina.
1.8.1.14	Agniomayam ekadash kapalam.
1.8.1.15	Hiranyam dakshina.
1.8.1.16	The Indra-offering is the first portion.
1.8.1.17	The Agni-offering is the second portion.
1.8.1.18	The Agnidhra-offering is the third portion.
1.8.1.19	The Indra-offering is for curd.
1.8.1.20	The Agni offering is for ghee.
1.8.1.21	The Indra Agni offering is for two portions.
1.8.1.22	The Vaishvadev offering is for cooked rice.
1.8.1.23	The first-born calf is for the Dakshina.
1.8.1.24	The Soma-sacrifice is the oblation of rice.
1.8.1.25	The Vasu-sacrifice is the offering of rice.
1.8.1.26	Sarasvati-sacrifice is the rice-oblation.
1.8.1.27	The Mithuna-sacrifice is the sacrifice of two cows.
1.8.2.1	One should offer an eight-pot Agni-sacrifice.
1.8.2.2	The Soma-sacrifice is an oblation of rice
1.8.2.3	The Savitri-sacrifice is the twelve-pot offering.
1.8.2.4	The Sarasvati-sacrifice is an offering of rice. 
1.8.2.5	The Pusha-sacrifice is anoblation of rice. 10.
1.8.2.6	The Marut-sacrifice is the seven-pot offering.
1.8.2.7	The offering to Visvedevas is of curds.
1.8.2.8	The offering to Dyau and Prithivi is of one potful.
1.8.3.1	The offering for Indra-Agni is of eleven potfuls.
1.8.3.2	The offering of curds to Maruts.
1.8.3.3	The offering in curds to Varuna.
1.8.3.4	The offering is of one potfull.
1.8.3.5	We invoke the Praghasa offerings.
1.8.3.6	The Maruts, the bearers of sacrifice,
1.8.3.7	With Karambha, are of one accord.
1.8.3.8	O Indra, in the battles, may the gods be with you, O strong one, in the battles.
1.8.3.9	For his great power, the Maruts praise the song of the generous one who offers oblations.
1.8.3.10	Whatever we have done in the village, in the forest, in the assembly, or in the presence of Indra,
1.8.3.11	Whatever we have committed against the Shudra or the noble one,
1.8.3.12	Whatever we did against one person, that is your atonement. Svāhā.
1.8.3.13	The gods, the creators of the world, have performed their work with speech and the creator.
1.8.3.14	Having performed the work for the gods, he has gone to the world of the good Dānavas.
1.8.4.1	He offers a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, the leader of the army, at sunrise together with the sun.
1.8.4.2	At midday, he offers rice-gruel to the Maruts, the tormentors.
1.8.4.3	In the evening, he offers rice gruel to the Marut householders, churned from all (kinds of) milk.
1.8.4.4	The full ladle falls away, full again it falls back.
1.8.4.5	Like a garment, O Indra, we have bought the food and strength.
1.8.4.6	Give me!
1.8.4.7	I give you!
1.8.4.8	Place in me!
1.8.4.9	I place in you!
1.8.4.10	It is placed in me!
1.8.4.11	Place in mine!
1.8.4.12	It is put in!
1.8.4.13	I place it in yours!
1.8.4.14	He offers a cake on seven potsherds to the playing Maruts.
1.8.5.2	To the Fathers who have the sacrificial grass, the oblations.
1.8.5.3	To the Fathers who are Agni-sviattas, the churned milk, churned for the Goddess of the Dawn.
1.8.5.4	This is yours, and those who follow you.
1.8.5.5	This is for your grandfather, great-grandfather, and those who are following you.
1.8.5.6	Here, O Fathers, do you distribute according to your shares.
1.8.5.7	We have praised you, O bountiful one, the well-seen one.
1.8.5.8	Now indeed, O Indra, praised, thou goest to the will of the Full-yoke.
1.8.5.9	The two horses of thee, O Indra, are yoked.
1.8.5.10	They have seen, they have rejoiced, they have enjoyed thy favour.
1.8.5.11	The bards have praised thee with new inspiration.
1.8.5.12	The two steeds of thee, O Indu, are yoked,
1.8.5.13	The fathers have seen,
1.8.5.14	The fathers rejoiced,
1.8.5.15	The fathers were satisfied,
1.8.5.16	The Fathers have anointed (him).
1.8.5.17	The Fathers, the departed, the Soma-drinkers, by the deep, ancient paths,
1.8.5.18	Now the Fathers, the givers of good gifts, who have drunk with Yama, rejoice in the same feast.
1.8.5.19	We invoke the mind with the Nārāśaṃsa hymn,
1.8.5.20	And with the thoughts of the Fathers.
1.8.5.21	May the mind return to us again,
1.8.5.22	For the sacrifice, for power, for life.
1.8.5.23	And may we see the sun shining.
1.8.5.24	May the divine people again give us our minds.

5.1.3.43	For the attainment of oblations.
5.1.3.44	With two (verses).
5.1.3.45-51	for the establishment of (the fire). When the mouth of the sacrifice is being performed, the Rakshas seek to injure the sacrifice. Now indeed this is the mouth of the sacrificial rite, when the oblation reaches it. He draws a line around (the fire). For the removal of the Rakshas. He draws three lines around. Agni is threefold.
5.1.3.52-60	As much as the fire, so much does it ward off the demons. He writes around with the Gāyatrī verse. The Gāyatrī is indeed brilliance. He encloses it with brilliance. He writes round with the Tristubh verse. The Tristubh is indeed power. He encircles it with power. He writes it around with the Anustubh verse. The Anustubh is the overlord of all the metres.
5.1.3.61	For sufficiency.
5.1.3.62	In the middle with the Anushtubh.
5.1.3.63	The Anushtubh is speech.
5.1.3.64	Therefore we speak with speech in the middle.
5.1.3.65	He writes with the first Gāyatrī, then with the Anushtup, then with the Tristup.
5.1.3.66	The Gāyatrī is indeed brilliance.
5.1.3.67	The Anushṭup is the sacrifice.
5.1.3.68	The Tristup is the power.
5.1.3.69	He encloses the sacrifice on both sides with brilliance and power.
5.1.4.1	"By the impulse of the divine Savitr."
5.1.4.2	He digs.
5.1.4.3	For propagation.
5.1.4.4	And also he generates smoke by this.
5.1.4.5	"The luminous, well-shaped Agni,"
5.1.4.6	He says.
5.1.4.7	He generates light by this.
5.1.4.8	That Agni, being born, entrusted the creatures to the purifying (fire).
5.1.4.9	The gods appeased him with half a verse.
5.1.4.10	"May he be auspicious to the creatures, not harming them."
5.1.4.11	He says:
5.1.4.12	He appeases him for the creatures.
5.1.4.13	He digs with two (verses).
5.1.4.14	For stability.
5.1.4.15	"You are the back of the waters."
5.1.4.16	He brings a lotus leaf.
5.1.4.17	The lotus leaf is indeed the back of the water.
5.1.4.18	He brings it with its form.
5.1.4.19	He fills it with a lotus leaf.
5.1.4.20	The lotus leaf is the womb of Agni.
5.1.4.21	He makes Agni with its womb.
5.1.4.22	He makes it with the skin of a black antelope.
5.1.4.23	The black antelope skin is the sacrifice.
5.1.4.24	He makes the sacrifice with the sacrifice.
5.1.4.25	If he were to make it with the skin from any domestic animal, he would consign domestic animals to impurity.
5.1.4.26	He makes (Agni) with the skin of the black antelope.
5.1.4.27-34	He offers the animals of the forest to the fire of purification. Therefore, among animals born, the animals of the forests are the younger ones. For they are born from the fire of purification.
5.1.4.35-41	He thus encloses him on both sides with these two (verses). Agni went away from the gods. He saw Atharvan. Atharvan first churned thee out, O Agni. He says. He unites him with the one who saw him. Thou, O Agni, from the lotus, he says.
5.1.4.42	He found him resting on a lotus leaf.
5.1.4.43	He said, "You are the one whom the sage Dadhyan found."
5.1.4.44	He said,
5.1.4.45	Dadhyan Atharva was radiant.
5.1.4.46	He places radiance in him.
5.1.4.47	He said to you, "You are Paithya Vrisha."
5.1.4.48	He said.
5.1.4.49	He praises it before sunrise from the north.
5.1.4.50	He fills it with four (verses).
5.1.4.51	There are four kinds of metres.
5.1.4.52	By means of the metres.
5.1.4.53	By the Gāyatrī metre for a Brāhmaṇa.
5.1.4.54	For the Brāhmaṇa is Gāyatrī.
5.1.4.55	By the Tristubh metre for a Kṣatriya.
5.1.4.56	For the Kṣatriya is Tristubh.
5.1.4.57	If one desires,
5.1.4.58	that he may be more powerful,
5.1.4.59	one should offer to him by means of both (kinds of) metres.
5.1.4.60	He places together his splendour and power.
5.1.4.61-73	He fills it with eight (verses). The Gayatri has eight syllables. Agni is Gayatri. He fills him with as much as Agni is. He says, "Do thou, O Hotar, be seated." He says, The deity indeed settles him. He says "Be seated, O Hotar." The men. He says: "Be seated." The animals. He says : "Be born, O son of birth, at the beginning of days."
5.1.4.74	He generates for him the gods and men who are united.
5.1.5.1	He does something cruel as it were when he digs.
5.1.5.2	He sprinkles water.
5.1.5.3	Water is peaceful.
5.1.5.4	With peaceful water he pacifies its impurity.
5.1.5.5	He says, "May Vayu, the father, grant you."
5.1.5.6	He says this.
5.1.5.7	Vayu is the breath.
5.1.5.8	He makes it firm with his own breath.
5.1.5.9	"He says, "May the wind be with you."
5.1.5.10	"
5.1.5.11	Therefore rain falls from the sky when the wind blows.
5.1.5.12	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, "May there be a 'Vasat' for you, O goddess, and for you."
5.1.5.13	" He says, "May it be for you."
5.1.5.14	There are six seasons.
5.1.5.15	He places the rain in the seasons.
5.1.5.16	Therefore he rains during all seasons.
5.1.5.17	If he were to recite the Vasat-call, then his Vasat-call would be wasted.
5.1.5.18	If he were not to recite the Vasāt-call, then the Rakṣas would destroy the sacrifice.
5.1.5.19	He says, "Vada!"
5.1.5.20	He says,
5.1.5.21	he recites the Vasat- call at the farthest point.
5.1.5.22	His Vasat-call is not wasted.
5.1.5.23	The Rakṣas do not destroy the sacrifice. "
5.1.5.24	"Well-born, with the light."
5.1.5.25	He binds it with the Anushtubh verse.
5.1.5.26	The Anushtubh is all the metres.
5.1.5.27	The metres indeed are Agni's dear body.
5.1.5.28	He encloses him with his own dear body.
5.1.5.29	One who knows this wears a garment of wool.
5.1.5.30	Agni is bound as belonging to Varuna.
5.1.5.31	"He rises up, O Agni, the upholder of law, upward, O Agni, thou art the upholder of the law."
5.1.5.32	He rises with the Savitri verses.
5.1.5.33	He releases the upward Varuna-noose, which is impelled by Savitri.
5.1.5.34	With two (verses).
5.1.5.35	For stability.
5.1.5.36	He says, "You are the embryo born, of the two worlds."
5.1.5.37	He says this.
5.1.5.38	These are the two worlds.
5.1.5.39	Of them, Agni is the embryo.
5.1.5.40	Therefore he says this.
5.1.5.41	"O Agni, thou art borne in the plants, shining."
5.1.5.42	He says:
5.1.5.43	"For when they bear him, then he becomes more shining."
5.1.5.44	"He roars above his mothers, like a bull."
5.1.5.45	He says
5.1.5.46	"The plants are his mothers."
5.1.5.47	He indeed causes him to be born from them.
5.1.5.48	"Be firm, be strong."
5.1.5.49	He lays down the Garhapatya.
5.1.5.50-57	He binds him with this (rope) for the sake of stability. He carries him with a donkey. Therefore the donkey is the most burdened of animals. He carries it with a donkey. Therefore the donkey is also the most burdened. He carries other animals. For they carry food and wealth with it. He carries with a donkey.
5.1.5.58	Therefore, the donkey, being of two kinds, is born as the lowest of animals.
5.1.5.59	For Agni burns his birthplace.
5.1.5.60	For now he has ascended to the creatures.
5.1.5.61	He is the lord who burns the creatures with grief.
5.1.5.62	"He says, "Be auspicious to the creatures."
5.1.5.63	He says.
5.1.5.64	He appeases him for the creatures.
5.1.5.65	"You are the son of Angiras, O human one."
5.1.5.66	He says:
5.1.5.67	"For the offspring are indeed human."
5.1.5.68	"Do not injure the sky and earth, do not injure the atmosphere, do not injure plants."
5.1.5.69	He says.
5.1.5.70	He appeases him from these worlds.
5.1.5.71	"Let the horse go neighing."
5.1.5.72	He says,
5.1.5.73	"For this is a horse."
5.1.5.74	"Let the donkey bray for the path."
5.1.5.75	He says,
5.1.5.76	The donkey is so called.
5.1.5.77	The sages have said this.
5.1.5.78	"He carries Agni, the domestic fire."
5.1.5.79	He says.
5.1.5.80	He indeed carries Agni.
5.1.5.81	"Do not let me die before my life is over."
5.1.5.82	He says,
5.1.5.83	He indeed places life in him.
5.1.5.84	Therefore the donkey lives out its entire life.
5.1.5.85	Therefore they fear that the donkey may die before its life is over.
5.1.5.86	"Bearing the bull Agni, the bull."
5.1.5.87	He says:
5.1.5.88	"For this is a bull.
5.1.5.89	Agni is a bull. "
5.1.5.90	"The embryo of the waters, the ocean-like."
5.1.5.91	He says
5.1.5.92	"For this Agni is the embryo of the waters. "
5.1.5.93	"O Agni, come to us, O Agni, come to this sacrifice."
5.1.5.94	The two worlds have become separated.
5.1.5.95	"O Agni come to us, come to this Agni, come to the sacrifice."
5.1.5.96	What he says,
5.1.5.97	For the sake of these two worlds.
5.1.5.98	He has indeed fallen from his abode, gone away from his support.
5.1.5.99	Now he thinks of the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer.
5.1.5.100	He says, 'Truth, truth.'
5.1.5.101	He says,
5.1.5.102	This is truth,
5.1.5.103	That is truth.
5.1.5.104	He establishes him in these two.
5.1.5.105	The Adhvaryu does not suffer any harm.
5.1.5.106	The sacrificer does not.
5.1.5.107	Indeed, this Agni, when kindled, approaches the sacrificer.
5.1.5.108	One should say, "The plants should take hold of this Agni."
5.1.5.109	He says,
5.1.5.110	"For peace."
5.1.5.111	"May he destroy all the evil intentions of the Rakshas."
5.1.5.112	He says
5.1.5.113	"For the destruction of the Rakshasas."
5.1.5.114	"May it destroy our evil intentions."
5.1.5.115	He says
5.1.5.116-124	for the establishment (of the sacrifice). "The plants rejoice in him, he says." He says: "The plants are Agni's share." He indeed unites him with them. "The plants with flowers and good herbs," he says. He says: Therefore the plants bear fruit. "This is your seasonal embryo, it has taken its place in the ancient abode," he says.
5.1.5.125	He says:
5.1.5.126	He establishes him in the very places where he has been thrown down.
5.1.5.127	He throws him down with two (verses).
5.1.5.128	For stability.
5.1.6.1	Varuna's Agni is thrown down.
5.1.6.2	"He says: 'Do thou loosen (the knot).'
5.1.6.3	He loosens (the knot).
5.1.6.4	He releases the crookedness of Varuna's noose, which is released by Savitr.
5.1.6.5	He releases it downwards.
5.1.6.6	The waters are peaceful.
5.1.6.7	He pacifies his impurity with the peaceful (verses).
5.1.6.8	He pours it down with three (verses).
5.1.6.9	Agni has three layers.
5.1.6.10	He pacifies as much impurity as Agni has.
5.1.6.11	He says, "Mitra has united with the earth."
5.1.6.12	He says this.
5.1.6.13	Mitra is the auspicious one among the gods.
5.1.6.14	He unites him with that.
5.1.6.15	For peace.
5.1.6.16-23	If one mixes with the potsherds of the village pots, one should offer the village pots to the pure. One mixes with the potshers of the village. These are not to be used. One offers them to the pure. One mixes with sand. For firmness. And for peace. One mixes (the pot) with goat hair.
5.1.6.24-32	This is Agni's dear body, the one that is the goat. He unites him with his dear body. And with his brilliance. He unites with the hairs of the black antelope skin. The black antelope skin is the sacrifice. He unites the sacrifice with the sacrifice. "He says, "The Rudras having united the earth." These indeed are the deities who first united him.
5.1.6.33-44	He fills him with those very (bricks). He says, 'Thou art the head of the sacrifice.' He says, The sacrifice is the Makha. Its head is the Ukhā. Therefore he says so. He says, '(You are) standing on the place of the sacrifice.' He says, For these are the places of the sacrifice. And for stability. He gives with some (bricks) and recites with others. For begetting a pair.
5.1.6.45	He makes it three-edged.
5.1.6.46	These are the three worlds.
5.1.6.47	For the attainment of these worlds.
5.1.6.48	He makes it with the metres.
5.1.6.49	The metres are energy.
5.1.6.50	He makes her with energy.
5.1.6.51	He digs the pit with a Yajus.
5.1.6.52	For spreading out.
5.1.6.53	He makes (it) of this size.
5.1.6.54	Equal to the face of the sacrifice of Prajapati.
5.1.6.55	He makes two breasts.
5.1.6.56-65	For the milking of heaven and earth. He makes it with four nipples. For the milking of cattle. He makes (it) with eight nipples. For milking the metres. One should make (it) with nine corners for one who is to be attacked. Having assembled the thunderbolt, he hurls it at his enemy. For covering. Having made the pot of earth, he places it.
5.1.7.11-21	This is Aditi. He digs out Aditi from Aditi. For her uninjured (performance). For gods do not injure themselves. He says, "For the wives of the gods." The wives of the gods indeed made her first. With them he establishes her. He says "For your wisdom." Wisdom is knowledge.
5.1.7.22-33	He binds her with the Vedas. He says, "Thou art the Gnas." He says, The Gnas are the metres. He cooks her with the metres. "Thou art the Varutrayas," He says, the Varutrayasa are the Hotrs. He cooks it with the Hotrs. "Thou art the Janas," He say, the Janas are the wives of the gods.
5.1.7.34-43	He cooks it with those (oils). He cooks it with six (oils). There are six seasons. He cooks it by means of the seasons. He says, "Let them cook twice." Therefore, the crops are cooked twice in a year. The cauldron is filled with water. It approaches the Maitravaruna. For peace.
5.1.7.44	"May the god Savitr bless thee."
5.1.7.45	He says.
5.1.7.46	He blesses her with the Brahman and the deities.
5.1.7.47	"Thou art the earth, thou art the directions, thou art the quarters."
5.1.7.48	He says,
5.1.7.49	Therefore Agni shines in all directions.
5.1.7.50	"Rise up, be the great one, stand upright, be the firm one."
5.1.7.51	He says,
5.1.7.52-62	for the establishment. The vessel is not filled. It is filled. It belongs to the gods. It is being filled with goat's milk. Goat's milk is the supreme milk. He fills it with the supreme milk. With the Yajus. For turning away. It is filed with the metres. This is done with the metres.
5.1.8.7	The head of a man is impure, as it is dead.
5.1.8.8	He places it in a heap of earth, cut into seven parts.
5.1.8.9	There are seven vital airs in the head.
5.1.8.10	He unites it with the vital airs.
5.1.8.11	For purity.
5.1.8.12	As many as are the friends of death, Yama has authority over them.
5.1.8.13	He sings with the verses of Yama.
5.1.8.14	He indeed wins it from Yama.
5.1.8.15	He sings with three (verses).
5.1.8.16	These are the three worlds.
5.1.8.17	He indeed wins it from these worlds.
5.1.8.18	Therefore one should not give (gifts) while singing.
5.1.8.19	For one wins it by singing.
5.1.8.20	One wins cattle from the fires.
5.1.8.21	The fires are desires.
5.1.8.22	He indeed obtains his desires.
5.1.8.23	If he does not offer animals, his animals would be unprotected.
5.1.8.24	If he were to release animals that have been consigned to fire, he would make them fit for sacrifice.
5.1.8.25	If he would establish them, the heads would be worn out.
5.1.8.26	If he offers animals,
5.1.8.27	he thereby protects the animals.
5.1.8.28	If he releases animals that have been consecrated, 
5.1.8.29	For the non-exhaustion of the head.
5.1.8.30	He establishes with the Prajapati (verse).
5.1.8.31	Prajapati is indeed the sacrifice.
5.1.8.32	He establishes the sacrifice in the sacrifice.
5.1.8.33	Prajapati created beings.
5.1.8.34	He thought, "I am being robbed."
5.1.8.35	He saw these appeasing (verses).
5.1.8.36	With them he appeased himself from the mouth.
5.1.8.37	When these appeasing (verse) are (recited),
5.1.8.38-46	Sacrifice is Prajapati. He pleases the sacrifice with these (verses) from the mouth. They are of unlimited metres. Prajapati is unlimited. For the attainment of Prajapati. (The verses) are deficient and excessive, in pairs. For propagation. This is the name of the metre of Prajapati, namely, Lomasha. Animals are hairy.
5.1.8.47	He indeed wins cattle.
5.1.8.48	All these are forms.
5.1.8.49	All forms are made in the fire-altar.
5.1.8.50	Therefore they are of the fire-altar;
5.1.8.51	He recites twenty-one kindling verses.
5.1.8.52	The twenty-one is indeed the light.
5.1.8.53	He indeed goes to light.
5.1.8.54	And also to stability.
5.1.8.55	The twenty-first is the consecration.
5.1.8.56	He mentions twenty-four.
5.1.8.57	Twenty-four half-months are a year.
5.1.8.58	The year is Agni Vaiśvānara.
5.1.8.59	He directly obtains Vaiśvānaran.
5.1.8.60	He mentions the reverse.
5.1.8.61	The world of heaven is indeed like the reverse.
5.1.8.62	"May the seasons increase thee, O Agni, in unison."
5.1.8.63	He says.
5.1.8.64	He increases Agni in unison.
5.1.8.65	The seasons increase the year.
5.1.8.66	"Mayst thou shine over all the directions of the earth."
5.1.8.67	He says:
5.1.8.68	Therefore Agni shines over all directions.
5.1.8.69	"May the Asvins lead us away from this death."
5.1.8.70	He says:
5.1.8.71	He drives away death from him.
5.1.8.72	He says, "We have risen above darkness."
5.1.8.73	He says,
5.1.8.74	"Darkness is sin."
5.1.8.75	He drives away sin from him.
5.1.8.76	"We have reached the highest light," he says.
5.1.8.77	He says
5.1.8.78	"The sun is the highest light."
5.1.8.79	He attains union with the sun.
5.1.8.80	The year does not stand still, nor does his glory stand still, for him for whom these are performed.
5.1.8.81	He says the Jyotishmati is the highest.
5.1.8.82	He places light above him.
5.1.8.83	For the attainment of the world of heaven.
5.1.9.1	He consecrates with six.
5.1.9.2	There are six seasons.
5.1.9.3	He consecrate him with the seasons.
5.1.9.4	He consigrates with seven.
5.1.9.5	The seven metres.
5.1.9.6	He consecrates him with the metres.
5.1.9.7	"With the verse, "All the deities, the leaders of the sacrifice,".
5.1.9.8	He offers with the Anushtubh metre as the last.
5.1.9.9	The Anushtubh is speech.
5.1.9.10	Therefore speech is the highest of the vital airs.
5.1.9.11	The first foot is incomplete from one syllable.
5.1.9.12	Therefore men live on what is incomplete in speech.
5.1.9.13	He offers with a complete (metre).
5.1.9.14	For Prajapati is indeed complete.
5.1.9.15	For the attainment of Prajapati.
5.1.9.16	One offers with a lesser (amount of) oblations.
5.1.9.17	For Prajapati created beings with a lesser (oblation).
5.1.9.18	For the creation of beings.
5.1.9.19	If one were to offer in the flames, one would destroy what has been.
5.1.9.20	If in the embers, what will be.
5.1.9.21	One offers in the embers.
5.1.9.22	One destroys what will be.
5.1.9.23	For the future is indeed from the past.
5.1.9.24	He chooses with two (verses).
5.1.9.25	The sacrificer has two feet.
5.1.9.26	For stability.
5.1.9.27	This is indeed the ladle which is filled with the Brahmanical formula.
5.1.9.28	If it were to break, the sacrificer would be afflicted, his sacrifice would be destroyed.
5.1.9.29	"He says, "May Mitra heat this ladle."
5.1.9.30	He says.
5.1.9.31	Mitra is indeed Brahman.
5.1.9.32	He establishes it in the Brahman itself.
5.1.9.33	The sacrificer does not suffer any harm, his sacrifice is not destroyed.
5.1.9.34	If it were to break, he should join it with those same potsherds.
5.1.9.35	That itself is the atonement.
5.1.9.36	If one has lost his prosperity, he should churn curd for him.
5.1.9.37	This is indeed a ghost.
5.1.9.38	He approaches his own deity.
5.1.9.39	He who desires prosperity should offer it to the one who has a pot. It would be his alone.
5.1.9.40	For from this he prospers.
5.1.9.41	This is indeed the name of the self-existent one.
5.1.9.42	It becomes so.
5.1.9.43	If one desires,
5.1.9.44	"One should generate enmity for him."
5.1.9.45	One should offer it from another place.
5.1.9.46	He directly generates enmity for him.
5.1.9.47	He should offer it to Ambarīṣa, the one who desires food.
5.1.9.48	Food is offered to Ambarīșa.
5.1.9.49	He obtains food with its own source.
5.1.9.50	He offers Muñja grass.

5.1.9.68	He goes to these worlds.
5.1.9.69	And he puts the breaths into himself.
5.1.10.1	For formerly Agni did not burn what had not been cut with an axe.

5.1.10.3	Whatever Agni, whatever there is.
5.1.10.4	He places the kindling wood.

5.1.10.23	"The Brahman of these is superior to their arms, and is more powerful."
5.1.10.24	He recites the Udumbara (post) at the end.
5.1.10.25	Brahman indeed conquers the Kshatra.
5.1.10.26	By the Kshatra, the Brahman.
5.1.10.27	Therefore a Brahman is superior to other Brahmans.

5.1.10.38	That is the overcoming of the Nirbadhas.
5.1.10.39	One becomes free from obstacles.
5.1.10.40	He makes his brothers free from obstruction.
5.1.10.41	He releases them with the Savitri verse.
5.1.10.42	For the birth.

5.1.11.8	United with the gods, in accord with Aditi, may she make it smooth and place it in the light.
5.1.11.9	These are your auspicious ones, of various forms, spreading out with their wings, rising up with their feathers,
5.1.11.10	The Rishis, the true ones, the singers, the shining ones, the goddesses, the door-openers, may they be well-disposed.
5.1.11.11	Moving between Mitra and Varuna, the two who know the face of the sacrifices,
5.1.11.12	I place you, O Dawn and Night, in the seat of truth, in the golden, well-fashioned one.
5.1.11.13	The first, with your golden chariot, O two gods, seeing all the worlds,

5.1.11.22	With the oblation offered with "Svāhā," may the gods, led by the Sadhyas, accept the oblation.
5.2.2.1	"O Lord of Food, grant us food."

5.2.2.20	There are four desires.
5.2.2.21	With desires.
5.2.2.22	With the best of desires.

5.2.2.35	He cries out.
5.2.2.36	He says:
5.2.2.37	For the destruction of demons.
5.2.2.38	They carry it with the Anas (verse).
5.2.2.39	He places the Apaciti (verse) in it.
5.2.2.40	Therefore the Anas and the Rathas are the most honoured of guests.
5.2.2.41	He who knows thus becomes honoured.
5.2.2.42	He kindles the fire with the Samid (verse).
5.2.2.43	Having placed the Samid (kindling wood) on the fire, he places the Samid (wood) with ghee.
5.2.2.44	Just as hospitality is offered to a guest who has arrived, so is this.
5.2.2.45	The Brahman's (rite) is performed with the Gāyatrī verse.
5.2.2.46	Because the Brahman is Gāyatrī.
5.2.2.47	The Kṣatriya's (rite is performed) with the Tristubh verse.
5.2.2.48	Because a Kṣatriya is Tristubh.
5.2.2.49	He places the ashes in water.
5.2.2.50	Because Agni has water as its source.
5.2.2.51	He sends him to his own source.
5.2.2.52	He makes it enter with three (verses).
5.2.2.53	Agni is threefold.

5.2.2.64	"He (the sacrificer) says, "May the Adityas, Rudras and Vasus kindle you again."
5.2.2.65	He says this.
5.2.2.66	These indeed are the deities who first kindled him.
5.2.2.67	He kindles him with them.
5.2.2.68	He awakens, he is awakened.
5.2.2.69	He stands up.
5.2.2.70	He awakens him.
5.2.2.71	Therefore, having slept, the creatures awaken.
5.2.2.72	He stands in his own place.
5.2.2.73	Therefore, the cattle return and stand in their own places.
5.2.3.1	As much as the earth, he would have dominion over it.
5.2.3.2	He who builds the fire for Yama, the god-worshipper, without having made the offering to Yama, builds it for Yama.
5.2.3.3	"He says, "Go away!"
5.2.3.4	He makes him decide.
5.2.3.5	He builds the fire for himself, having made the offering for Yama, the worshipper of the gods.
5.2.3.6	The gods, desiring immortality, did not find it in the east.
5.2.3.7	They saw this mantra of the gods:
5.2.3.8	" "He says, "Come!"
5.2.3.9	What he determines by this.
5.2.3.10	One builds the fire without the (proper) rite.
5.2.3.11	One digs it up.
5.2.3.12	What is impure in him, that he removes.
5.2.3.13	One sprinkles water.
5.2.3.14	For peace.
5.2.3.15	One sows sand.
5.2.3.16	This is the form of Agni Vaiśvānara.
5.2.3.17	By means of the form one wins Vaiśvānaran.
5.2.3.18	One sows ashes.
5.2.3.19	The Uṣas are indeed nourishment and procreation.
5.2.3.20	He builds the fire in nourishment and procreation itself.
5.2.3.21	And also in recognition.
5.2.3.22	For the Uṣas are the recognition of cattle.
5.2.3.23	Heaven and earth were together.
5.2.3.24	They said to each other:
5.2.3.25	"Let there be a common sacrifice for us."
5.2.3.26	What was sacrificial in the other, that he placed in this; they became the Uṣas.
5.2.3.27	What was sacrificial in this, that he placed into the other; that became the dark (moon) in the moon.
5.2.3.28	One who is sowing Uṣas should meditate on this.
5.2.3.29	He builds the sacrificial fire of heaven and earth.
5.2.3.30	This is the Agni.
5.2.3.31	The verses of Visvamitra are recited.
5.2.3.32	By this (verse) Visvamitra attained the dear abode of Agni.
5.2.3.33	By this one attains the dear abode of the Agni.
5.2.3.34	The gods went to the heavenly world by means of the metres.
5.2.3.35	He places four in the east.
5.2.3.36	There are four metres.
5.2.3.37	By means of the metres the sacrificer goes to the heavenly world.
5.2.3.38	Those who go to the heaven of the gods, they are scattered in all directions.
5.2.3.39	They placed two Samīci bricks in front.
5.2.3.40	Two Samīci bricks behind.
5.2.3.41	By them they established the directions.
5.2.3.42	When he places two Samīci-bricks in front and two Samīci in the rear,
5.2.3.43	it is for the establishment of the directions.
5.2.3.44	And the metres are indeed cattle.
5.2.3.45	He places cattle in the form of Samīci- bricks.
5.2.3.46-55	He lays down eight (bricks). The Gayatri has eight syllables. Agni is Gayatri. He builds him as big as Agni is. He lays down eight (layers of bricks). The Gayatra has eight syllables. The Gayatri leads to the heavenly world directly. For the attainment of the heavenly world. He lays thirteen Lokamprana bricks. They make up twenty-one.
5.2.3.56-63	The twenty-first is the establishment. The Garhapatya is the establishment. One who knows this stands in the establishment of the twenty-first. One who knows this stands at the fire when it is being kindled. One who is going to kindle the fire for the first time should kindle the five-layered fire. The sacrifice is fivefold. Animals are fivefold. He wins the sacrifice and animals.
5.2.3.64	One should build a three-layered fire altar when building the second one.
5.2.3.65	These are the three worlds.
5.2.3.66	They stand in these worlds.
5.2.3.67	One should build a one-layered fire altar while building the third one.
5.2.3.68	The world of heaven is indeed one-fold.
5.2.3.69	One goes to the world of heaven by being one-fold. One builds the third fire altar.
5.2.3.70	One builds it with soil.
5.2.3.71	Therefore, bone is covered with flesh.
5.2.3.72	He who knows this does not become a bad skin.
5.2.3.73	There are five kinds of excrement.
5.2.3.74	One covers with five kinds of excrements.
5.2.3.75	They become ten.
5.2.3.76	The Viraj has ten syllables.
5.2.3.77	Food is Viraj.
5.2.3.78	One stands in food through Viraj.
5.2.4.1	These two are indeed enemies, the one who was in the fire and the one in the cauldron.
5.2.4.2	They are united.
5.2.4.3-11	He offers with four (verses). There are four metres. The metres are indeed Agni's dear body. He unites them with his dear body. (He says) 'Come together!' Therefore the Brahman comes together with the Kshatra. When he moves after having united, therefore the Brahman moves away from the Kshatra.
5.2.4.12-18	The seasons indeed consecrate him. He is released by the seasons. "He says, "Like a mother her son, the earth her husband." The seasons indeed consecrate and release him by the seasons.
5.2.4.19-25	The three black ones are cooked in husks. Husks are the share of Nirriti. The form of Nirriti is black. He appeases Nirriti with her own form. They go to this direction. This is the direction of Nirriti. They appease Nirriti in her own direction.
5.2.4.26-33	He places it in the ditch or in the cleft. This is indeed the abode of Nirriti. He releases Nirriti in her own abode. He places the noose. Nirriti is the noose. He releases him directly from the noose of Nirriti. He places three (bricks). Man is divided into three parts.
5.2.4.34	As far as the man is, so far he offers to Nirriti.
5.2.4.35	He places it facing the east.
5.2.4.36	He drives Nirriti away from him.
5.2.4.37	They go without waiting.
5.2.4.38	To escape from Nirriti.
5.2.4.39	Having sprinkled, they stand up.
5.2.4.40	For purity.
5.2.4.41	They stand up to the Garhapatya.
5.2.4.42	Having wandered in the world of Nirriti, they return to the world of the gods, being purified.
5.2.4.43	They stand together.
5.2.4.44	Together they bestow strength on the sacrificer.
5.2.4.45	"The dwelling place, the meeting place of the Vasus."
5.2.4.46	He says:
5.2.4.47	"The Vasus are indeed offspring and cattle."
5.2.4.48	They unite him with offspring and cattle.
5.2.5.1	He measures with a man's height.
5.2.5.2	A man is measured by the sacrifice.
5.2.5.3	He measures him with the sacrificial cord.
5.2.5.4	He becomes as tall as a man with arms raised.
5.2.5.5	This is the extent of a man's strength.
5.2.5.6	He measures him with strength.
5.2.5.7	He becomes winged.
5.2.5.8	For one without wings is not fit to fly.
5.2.5.9	The wings are longer than the span.
5.2.5.10	Therefore the wings are longer than other parts of the body.
5.2.5.11-21	The wings are a fathom long and the tail is also so. This is the extent of the man's virility. It is equal to virility. He measures with a bamboo. The bamboo is connected with Agni. For the sake of being connected with the source. He yokes with a formula. He ploughs with a formula. For the sake of turning away. He ploughes with a six-yoke. There are six seasons.
5.2.5.22	He ploughs him with the seasons.
5.2.5.23	Because it is with the twelve-fold plough,
5.2.5.24	It is with the year.
5.2.5.25	This (earth) was afraid of Agni's burning.
5.2.5.26	She saw this as twofold, ploughed and not ploughed.
5.2.5.27	Then he did not burn her.
5.2.5.28	When there is both ploughed and not-ploughed, it is for her non-burning.
5.2.5.29	They say that one should offer twice as much to Agni.
5.2.5.30	What is sown and what is not sown, for the rising of Agni.
5.2.5.31	There are so many animals, two-footed and four-footed.
5.2.5.32	If one were to release them towards the east, one would give them to Rudra.
5.2.5.33	If one releases them towards the south, one would give to the ancestors.
5.2.5.34	The Raksases who are in the west would strike them.
5.2.5.35	He releases them towards the north.
5.2.5.36	This is the peaceful direction of the gods and men.
5.2.5.37	He releases the animals towards that direction.
5.2.5.38	Or he releases them towards this direction.
5.2.5.39	The sun is indeed the breath.
5.2.5.40	He releases animals towards the breath.
5.2.5.41	They turn towards the south.
5.2.5.42	They turn back to their own strength.
5.2.5.43	Therefore the right half of the body is stronger.
5.2.5.44	Then they turn back following the shadow of the sun.
5.2.5.45	Therefore the cattle go away and return.
5.2.5.46	He ploughs three furrows each time.
5.2.5.47	He spreads the three-fold sacrifice at the mouth of the sacrifice.
5.2.5.48	He sows the plants.
5.2.5.49	He wins the food of the Brahmanas.
5.2.5.50	The sun is sown with the sun.
5.2.5.51	He sows with fourteen (seeds).
5.2.5.52	There are seven plants of the village and seven of the forest; for the winning of both.
5.2.5.53	He sows for every kind of food.
5.2.5.54	For the winning of every kind of food
5.2.5.55	He sows in the ploughed (field).
5.2.5.56	For in the ploughed field the plants stand firm.
5.2.5.57	He sows on the sown (seeds).
5.2.5.58	For propagation.
5.2.5.59	He sows on twelve furrows.
5.2.5.60	Twelve months are a year.
5.2.5.61	With the year he cooks food for him.
5.2.5.62	If one were to eat of the fire-altar which is not enclosed, one would be deprived of what is enclosed.
5.2.5.63	The fruits of the trees which are taken, one should sprinkle on the fire-wood.
5.2.5.64	For the unclosed (fire) to be closed.
5.2.5.65	He collects the clods from the directions.
5.2.5.66	He closes the power of the directions and builds the fire in the power of the Directions.
5.2.5.67	He should take a clod from the direction where the one he hates is, saying,
5.2.5.68	"I take from here food and strength."
5.2.5.69	He closes the food and strength of that direction.
5.2.6.3	This is the hymn of Agni Vaisvānara.
5.2.6.4	One binds Vaisvānaran with the hymn itself.
5.2.6.5	He offers six times.
5.2.6.6	There are six seasons, a year.
5.2.6.7	Agni Vaisvānari is a year.
5.2.6.8	One binds Agni Vaisvânara directly.
5.2.6.9	This is the name of the ocean, the metre.
5.2.6.10	Beings are born following the ocean.
5.2.6.11	With this he scatters the seeds.
5.2.6.12	For the propagation of offspring.
5.2.6.13	Indra struck Vritra with the thunderbolt.
5.2.6.14	It became three-fold: the wooden mallet was one-third, the chariot was one-third and the sacrificial post was one-third.
5.2.6.15	The arrows that fell within became gravel.
5.2.6.16	That is why gravel is called gravel.
5.2.6.17	Gravel is the thunderbolt.
5.2.6.18	The animal is Agni.
5.2.6.19	With which he encloses the fire with lumps of sugar.
5.2.6.20	With the thunderbolt he indeed encloses the animals for him.
5.2.6.21	Therefore the animals are enclosed with the thunderbolt.
5.2.6.22	Therefore the stable ones do not harm the unstable ones.
5.2.6.23	One should enclose with three sevens for one who desires animals.
5.2.6.24	There are seven vital breaths in the head.
5.2.6.25	Animals are the vital breaths.
5.2.6.26	He binds the animals to him with his own life.
5.2.6.27	With nine (verses) for one who has enemies.
5.2.6.28	Having collected the three-fold enclosure, he hurls it at the enemy.
5.2.6.29	For covering.
5.2.6.30	One should cover with unlimited (verses).
5.2.6.31	For the covering of the unlimited.
5.2.6.32	If one desires:
5.2.6.33	He should be without cattle.
5.2.6.34	He should scatter sand on it, without limit.
5.2.6.35	His semen is scattered and not held back.
5.2.6.36	He becomes without cattle.
5.2.6.37	If one desires:
5.2.6.38	"He should become one who has cattle."
5.2.6.39	He should scatter sand on him, with limit.
5.2.6.40	His seed is held back and not scattered.
5.2.6.41	He becomes possessed of cattle.
5.2.6.42	He offers with the Somiya (verse).
5.2.6.43	Soma indeed is the bestower of semen.
5.2.6.44	He thus places semen.
5.2.6.45	With the Gayatri (verse) for the Brahman.
5.2.6.46	For the Brahman is Gayatri.
5.2.6.47	With the Tristubh (verse) for a Kshatriya.
5.2.6.48	For the Kshatriya is Tristubh.
5.2.6.49	The Barhaspatya Soma, the sage, did not come to us.
5.2.6.50	He entered Agni.
5.2.6.51	He entered the horse, assuming Agni's dark form.
5.2.6.52	He entered the horse.
5.2.6.53	He became the horse's tail.
5.2.6.54	When one enters the horse,
5.2.6.55	one obtains that very brilliance which entered the horse. "
5.2.6.56	"Agni should be worshipped with Prajapati."
5.2.6.57	They say:
5.2.6.58	The horse is Prajapati.
5.2.6.59	When one mounts the horse,
5.2.7.3-10	Prajapati created the creatures through the mouth of Brahma. The sacrificer creates the creatures through the same mouth of Brahma. The mouth of Brahma is the Brahman. He says, "Brahman is the womb." Therefore the Brahman is the chief. He who knows this becomes the chief. Brahmanists say: "Fire should not be kindled on earth, in the sky, or in heaven."
5.2.7.11	If he were to pile it on the earth, he would offer the earth to the fire. The herbs and trees would not grow.
5.2.7.12	If he were to pile on the sky, he would offer sky to the fire. Birds would not grow. 
5.2.7.13	If he were were to pile on heaven, he would offer heaven to the fire. Rain would not fall.
5.2.7.14	He places gold.
5.2.7.15	Gold is immortality.
5.2.7.16	He builds the fire-altar of immortality.
5.2.7.17	For progeny.
5.2.7.18	He places a golden man.
5.2.7.19	For the support of the world of the sacrificer.
5.2.7.20	If he were to place it below the brick, he would cause the life of the animals and the sacrificer to be taken away.
5.2.7.21	He places it on the right side, facing east.
5.2.7.22	He supports the world of the Sacrificer.
5.2.7.23	He does not even take away the life of the animals and the sacrificer.
5.2.7.24	And indeed he places the un-cut out of the bricks.
5.2.7.25	For the release of the vital airs.
5.2.7.26	"The drop has fallen,"
5.2.7.27	He presses down.
5.2.7.28	He establishes him in the Hotr-s.
5.2.7.29	He puts the two ladles, filled with ghee, made of Caruksha wood, and filled with curds, made of Udumbara wood.
5.2.7.30	This one is made of Caru-ksha wood.
5.2.7.31	That one is made of Udumbára wood.
5.2.7.32	He puts them down here.
5.2.7.33	He puts down silently.
5.2.7.34	For these two are not worthy of being put down with a formula.
5.2.7.35	The one on the right is made of Carúksha wood.
5.2.7.36	The one to the left is made of Udúmbara wood.
5.2.7.37-45	Therefore this is the northern one. The full ladle of ghee, the ladle of wood. Ghee is a thunderbolt. Wood is a thunderbolt. With the thunderbolt he indeed repels the foes from the sacrifice on the right side. The full vessel of curds, the ladle of Udumbara wood. Curds are cattle. Udumbara is strength. He indeed places strength in cattle.
5.2.7.46-54	He places it in the full (vessel). He establishes him in the full (world). They say, "Agni should be built with Viraj." The ladle is Viraj. When he places it in the ladle, he builds Agni with Viraj. The sacrifice is attacked by the demons when it is being performed. The sacrifice-mouth is gold.
5.2.7.55	When he spreads the gold,
5.2.7.56	he indeed drives away the demons from the mouth of the sacrifice.
5.2.7.57	He spreads with five (verses),
5.2.7.58	the sacrifice is fivefold.
5.2.7.59	He indeed drives away the Rakshas from the extent of the sacrifice. He spreads with the verse,
5.2.7.60	"The eye is the best of all organs."
5.2.7.61	Therefore animals take up their limbs with the eye.
5.2.7.62	For stability.
5.2.8.1-8	He places the Svayamātr̥ṇṇā (brick) himself. This (earth) indeed is the Svayamā-tr̥ṇṇă. He places it on this (earth). He makes the horse smell (the brick). He places the breath in it. And the horse is of Prajapati. He builds the fire-altar with Prajapati. When the first brick is being placed, he places the breath of the animals and the sacrificer.
5.2.8.9	It is made of one's own grass.
5.2.8.10	For the release of the vital airs.
5.2.8.11	And also for the fame of the heavenly world.
5.2.8.12	It is said, "Agni should be conceived in Agni."
5.2.8.13	They say:
5.2.8.14	This indeed is Agni Vaisvānara, namely, the Brāhmaṇa.
5.2.8.15	To him one should offer the first brick made according to the Yajus.
5.2.8.16	The Brāhmaṇa should also place it.
5.2.8.17-25	He thus builds the fire in the fire. He who, ignorant, lays down a brick, is indeed the lord of misfortune. One should give three boons. There are three vital breaths. For the sake of touching the vital breaths. Two should be given. For there are two vital breaths. One alone should be given. For there is one vital breath.
5.2.8.26	The Agni is indeed an animal.
5.2.8.27	Animals do not delight in a place of confinement.
5.2.8.28	He places the Dūrvā brick.
5.2.8.29	For the stability of animals.
5.2.8.30	With two (bricks).
5.2.8.31	For stability.
5.2.8.32	It grows from one stalk to another,
5.2.8.33	he says.
5.2.8.34	For it indeed grows from one stalk (to another).
5.2.8.35	"Thus, O Dūrva, do thou spread for us with a thousand and with a hundred."
5.2.8.36	He says:
5.2.8.37	"Prajapati is a thousand."
5.2.8.38	For the attainment of Prajapati.
5.2.8.39	The three-lined one is the mark of the gods.
5.2.8.40	The gods placed it with the upper mark.
5.2.8.41	The Asuras with the lower mark.
5.2.8.42	He for whom one desires:
5.2.8.43	"May he be more powerful."
5.2.8.44	One should place it with the upper marks for him.
5.2.8.45	He becomes more powerful.
5.2.8.46	If one desires:
5.2.8.47	"He should become worse."
5.2.8.48	One should place it below the characteristics of the one who is to become worse.
5.2.8.49	One causes him to be destroyed in the womb of the Asuras.
5.2.8.50	He becomes worse.
5.2.8.51	It is written with three lines.
5.2.8.52	These worlds are written with three lines,
5.2.8.53	One's enemy is destroyed in these worlds.
5.2.8.54	The Angirasas, from whom the Purorasa (oblation) became a tortoise and went to the heavenly world.
5.2.8.55	When he places the tortoise,
5.2.8.56	just as a surveyor leads (the way) directly, so the tortoise leads him directly to the heavenly world;
5.2.8.57	The tortoise is indeed the wisdom of animals.
5.2.8.58	When he puts the tortoise,
5.2.8.59	The animals stand around, looking at their own radiance.
5.2.8.60	The place where the heads of dead animals are placed is like a cremation ground.
5.2.8.61	When one places a living tortoise,
5.2.8.62	it makes the cremation ground complete.
5.2.8.63	The tortoise is the one who belongs to the earth.
5.2.8.64	"The wind blows for the one who is truthful."
5.2.8.65-73	He anoints it with curd mixed with honey. He makes it taste good. Curd is the food of the village, honey is the food of forest. When he anoints it with honey mixed with curd, it is for the securing of both. He says, "The great heaven and earth." He says this. He thus encloses it on both sides.
5.2.8.74	He places it facing east.
5.2.8.75	Therefore, animals stand facing east to the oblation.
5.2.8.76	He who builds a fire-altar facing south, enters the navel of the sacrificer.
5.2.8.77	He becomes a lord of injury.
5.2.8.78	He places the mortar.
5.2.8.79	This is the navel of Agni.
5.2.8.80	He builds the fire-altar with the same navel.
5.2.8.81	For non-injury.
5.2.8.82-92	It is of Udumbara wood. Udumbara is energy. He indeed secures energy. He places it in the middle. He indeed places energy in the middle. Therefore, they eat energy in the middle (of the body). It is of this size. It is measured by Prajapati, the gateway of sacrifice. He strikes down. Food indeed is the Akas. He places the verse of Vishnu.
5.2.8.93	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
5.2.8.94	The trees are Vishnu's.
5.2.8.95	The sacrifice is established in the sacrifice.
5.2.9.1	This is the light of these worlds which is collected in the pot.
5.2.9.2	When he places the pot,
5.2.9.3	he obtains light from these worlds.
5.2.9.4	He places it in the middle.
5.2.9.5	He places light in the middle for him.
5.2.9.6	Therefore we worship the light in the middle.
5.2.9.7	He fills it with sand.
5.2.9.8	This is the form of Agni Vaiśvānara.
5.2.9.9	By means of the form, he wins Vaiśvānaran.
5.2.9.10	If one desires:
5.2.9.11	"He should be a miser."
5.2.9.12	One should put less for him.
5.2.9.13	He becomes a miser.
5.2.9.14	If one wishes:
5.2.9.15	"May he eat food without being given."
5.2.9.16	He should place the full (bricks).
5.2.9.17	One eats food without being placed.
5.2.9.18	A man gives a thousand animals.
5.2.9.19	Other animals are a thousand.
5.2.9.20	He places the head of a man in the middle.
5.2.9.21	For the sake of having power.
5.2.9.22	He also places it in the pot.
5.2.9.23	He makes him attain stability.
5.2.9.24-29	The head of a man is impure, as it is dead. The vital airs are indeed immortal, and gold is immortal. He places the gold pieces on the vital airs. Having made him attain stability, he unites him with the vital airs. He fills it with curds mixed with honey. "May he be worthy of honey."
5.2.9.30-40	for the sake of being purified. For the sake of being pure. For this food is of the village, and honey is of the forest. When he fills it with honey mixed with curds, it is for the sake of obtaining both. He places the animal heads. The animal heads are indeed animals. He obtains animals. If one desires, "he should say, "Let him be without animals."
5.2.9.41	He should place them in the direction of the disease.
5.2.9.42	He places the animals in the direction of disease.
5.2.9.43	He becomes without animals.
5.2.9.44	If one desires:
5.2.9.45	"He should become with animals."
5.2.9.46	He should place them in a friendly direction.
5.2.9.47	He places animals in a friendly direction for him.
5.2.9.48	He becomes with animals.
5.2.9.49	He places them in front, facing west, of the horse.
5.2.9.50-56	Then the bull of the east. The animals are different from the cattle, the cows and horses. He places the cattle, the cow and horse, in order for him. These are the animals, the two-footed and the four-footed. He places them in the fire when he places the animal heads. "He says, "I direct you to the forest one."
5.2.9.57	From the domestic animals he releases the wild animals in a pure manner.
5.2.9.58	Therefore, among animals being born, the wild animals are smaller.
5.2.9.59	For they are born in a pure manner,
5.2.9.60	He places the head of a snake.
5.2.9.61	He obtains the very brilliance of the snake.
5.2.9.62	If one were to place the heads of domestic animals in the proper order, the domestic animals would be afflicted with disease.
5.2.9.63	If in the wrong order, the wild animals.
5.2.9.64	One should recite the Yajus.
5.2.9.65	One seizes the brilliance of the serpent.
5.2.9.66	One does not harm the domestic animals.
5.2.9.67	Nor the wild ones.
5.2.9.68	Or else, it is indeed a kind of offering.
5.2.9.69	When one places (the heads),
5.2.9.70	He thereby obtains that radiance which is in the serpent.
5.2.9.71	When he recites the Yajus.
5.2.9.72	It becomes peaceful.
5.2.10.1	The Agni is indeed an animal.
5.2.10.2	This is indeed the womb of the animal, when the Yajus is performed before the bricks.
5.2.10.3	The semen is in the Apasyā.
5.2.10.4	He places the Apasyā bricks.
5.2.10.5	He places semen in the womb.
5.2.10.6	He places five (bricks).
5.2.10.7	The animals are the steps.
5.2.10.8	He generates animals for him.
5.2.10.9	Five to the south.
5.2.10.10	The thunderbolt is the Apasyas.
5.2.10.11	With the thunderbolt he indeed repels the Rakshas from the right side of the sacrifice.
5.2.10.12	He places five bricks towards the east, towards the west.
5.2.10.13	The seed is deposited towards the east, behind.
5.2.10.14	He deposits the seed towards the east, in the rear.
5.2.10.15	He places five in front, facing west.
5.2.10.16	Five behind, facing east.
5.2.10.17	Therefore semen is deposited facing east.
5.2.10.18	Progeny is born facing west.
5.2.10.19	The five on the north are the Chhandasya.
5.2.10.20	The Chhandasya are cattle.
5.2.10.21	He encloses the progeny of cattle in its own abode.
5.2.10.22	This (earth) was afraid of Agni's burning.
5.2.10.23	She saw these (bricks).
5.2.10.24	She placed them.
5.2.10.25	Then it did not burn this (earth).
5.2.10.26	When one places the Apasyas,
5.2.10.27	it is for the non-burning of this (earth). The Apasyas are placed.
5.2.10.28	He said: "This is to be given.
5.2.10.29	He who gives food to the Brahman, to him these are placed, and he who knows this."
5.2.10.30	He places the Pranabhrits.
5.2.10.31	He places the vital airs in the semen.
5.2.10.32	Therefore, he who speaks, breathes, sees, and hears, becomes an animal.
5.2.10.33	"This is the one in front, the one in the east."
5.2.10.34	He places it in front.
5.2.10.35	He supports the breath with these.
5.2.10.36	"This one is on the right, the one with all activities."
5.2.10.37	On the right.
5.2.10.38	He supports mind with these.
5.2.10.39	This one is behind, the one with universal vision.
5.2.10.40	Behind.
5.2.10.41	He supports sight with these.
5.2.10.42	This is the northern (part) of the gold.
5.2.10.43	On the northern side.
5.2.10.44	He supports the ear with these (verses).
5.2.10.45	This is the upper (part) of wisdom.
5.2.10.46	On the upper side.
5.2.10.47	He holds the speech with these (verses)
5.2.10.48	He places ten by ten.
5.2.10.49	For the sake of having cattle.
5.2.10.50	He places the eyes.
5.2.10.51	Therefore cattle and limbs are taken away by the eyes.
5.2.10.52	For stability.
5.2.10.53	Those which are in the east, with them Vasishtha prospered.
5.2.10.54	Those which are in the south, with them Bharadvaja.
5.2.10.55	Those which were in the west, with them Vishvamitra.
5.2.10.56	Those which in the north, with them Jamadagni.
5.2.10.57	Those which above, with them Vishvakarman.
5.2.10.58	He who knows thus the prosperity of these, prospers.
5.2.10.59	He who knows their relationship becomes related to them.
5.2.10.60	He who knows their arrangement is arranged for him.
5.2.10.61	He who know their abode becomes one who has an abode.
5.2.10.62	He who understands their foundation stands firmly.
5.2.10.63	Having placed the life-supporting, he places the restrained.
5.2.10.64	Having placed the vital airs in him, he restrains them with the restraints.
5.2.10.65	That is the restraint of the restrained.
5.2.10.66	And he places the out-breath in the in-breath.
5.2.10.67	Therefore the in-breath and the out-breath move together.
5.2.10.68	He places the vital airs in the middle.
5.2.10.69	Therefore the vital airs move in the middle. The vital airs are the middle.
5.2.10.70	Whatever is unrestrained of Agni, that is not leading to heaven.
5.2.10.71	Agni is the one who leads to heaven.
5.2.10.72	When he places the one who is restrained,
5.2.10.73	he restrains him.
5.2.10.74	He indeed leads to heaven. The one who is restrained.
5.2.10.75	"He says: "The age of the three-fold-aged ones has been made."
5.2.10.76	He says:
5.2.10.77	He indeed restrains the one who is going with the ages.
5.2.10.78	The ages are the ones who are going.
5.2.10.79	They are all-pervading.
5.2.10.80	Therefore, this (wind) blows from all sides.
5.2.11.1	Gāyatrī, Tristubh, Jagatī, Anushtubh, and Pankti together.
5.2.11.2	Brihatī, Uṣṇīṣa, Kakubh, and the needles may pierce you.
5.2.11.3	The two-footed, the four-footed, the three-footed, and the six-footed,
5.2.11.4	The well-formed and the ill-formed, may the needles pierce you.
5.2.11.5	Mahānāmikā, Revatī, all directions, and the Prasuvarīs,
5.2.11.6	May the lightning-bolts of the clouds, with needles, pierce thee.
5.2.11.7	The silver-coloured, tawny-coloured, lead-coloured mares are yoked with their tasks.
5.2.11.8	May the needles of the horse's skin, with needles, prick thee.
5.2.11.9	May thy wives, the women, with their minds, pluck out thy hair.
5.2.11.10	May the wives of the gods, the directions, with needles, stab thee.
5.2.12.4	May the days of the year, with their Shimas, be at peace with thee.
5.2.12.5	May the divine Adhvaryus be at peace with thy limbs and arrange them.
5.2.12.6	May the Shimas, while being at peace, make thy limbs peaceful in their joints.
5.2.12.7	May the half-months, the Parus, and the months, while being at ease, be at peace.
5.2.12.8	May the Maruts, the day and night, arrange the scattered parts of thee.
5.2.12.9	May the earth heal thee with the sky, the wind with the space.
5.2.12.10	May the heaven with the stars make thy form good.
5.2.12.11	Good be thy upper limbs, good be thy lower limbs.
5.2.12.12	Good be thine bones, good be thy marrow, good be thy body.
5.3.1.1	The Agni is indeed the lost sacrifice.
5.3.1.2	What is done for him? What is not done?
5.3.1.3	Whatever is done for the sacrifice, that is purified.
5.3.1.4	He lays down the Aśvinī bricks.
5.3.1.5	The Aśvins are the physicians of the gods.
5.3.1.6	He makes him well by them.
5.3.1.7	He lays five (bricks).
5.3.1.8	The sacrifice is fivefold.
5.3.1.9	He makes it well as much as the sacrifice is.
5.3.1.10	He places the Rtuvyas (bricks).
5.3.1.11	For the establishment of the seasons.
5.3.1.12	He places five (bricks).
5.3.1.13	There are five seasons.
5.3.1.14	He establishes as many seasons as there are.
5.3.1.15	They are of equal height.
5.3.1.16	They are equal in size.
5.3.1.17	Therefore the seasons are equal.
5.3.1.18	They are turned back by one step.
5.3.1.19	Therefore the Seasons turn back.
5.3.1.20	He places the Prāṇabhṛt (bricks) at the end.
5.3.1.21	He places the Prānas in the seasons.
5.3.1.22	Therefore, though the seasons are equal, they do not decay.
5.3.1.23	And he indeed generates them.
5.3.1.24	This indeed is Vayu, namely Prāṇa.
5.3.1.25	When he places the Rtuvyā (bricks) and then the Prāṇbhṛt (bricks),
5.3.1.26	therefore Vayu blows after all the seasons.
5.3.1.27	He places the 'Rain-bringing' stones.
5.3.1.28	He indeed wins rain.
5.3.1.29	If he were to place them in one layer, it would rain in one season.
5.3.1.30	He places them in layers one above the other.
5.3.1.31	Therefore it rains in all seasons.
5.3.1.32	When he places the 'Life-supporting' stones and then the 'Rain-brining' stones,
5.3.1.33	Therefore rain flows from the sky driven by the wind.
5.3.1.34	Animals are the same age.
5.3.1.35	Animals have different minds, different observances.
5.3.1.36	They are united in water.
5.3.1.37	If one desires:
5.3.1.38	"He should be without animals."
5.3.1.39	One should place the same age ones below him.
5.3.1.40	He makes him invisible to animals.
5.3.1.41	He becomes without animals.
5.3.1.42	If one wishes:
5.3.1.43	"He will have animals."
5.3.1.44	He should place the Vyasya stones on the side of the Apasya stone.
5.3.1.45	He makes him known by means of cattle.
5.3.1.46	He becomes possessed of cattle.
5.3.1.47	She places four stones in front.
5.3.1.48	Therefore, there are four forms of sight, two white and two black.
5.3.1.49	They are placed on the head.
5.3.1.50	Therefore, the head is in front.
5.3.1.51-60	He places five in the southern hip. Five in the northern hip. Therefore the animal is sloping towards the south and is higher at the back than at the front. "He places (the animal) with the verse, "The bull is our age." He places it on the right shoulder. "He says, "The bull-like one is our age." He places it on the left shoulder. He places the two shoulders. "He puts (the animal) on the right wing with the verse, "The tiger is our age."

5.3.4.108	Those gods saw these lights.
5.3.4.109	They placed them.

5.3.5.27	For him who places these.
5.3.5.28	His enemy does not exist.
5.3.5.29	Indeed, Agni is an animal.
5.3.5.30	He places Viraj in the uppermost layer.
5.3.5.31	He places the uppermost Viraj among animals.
5.3.5.32	Therefore, one who has animals speaks the uppermost speech.

5.3.5.34	For the sake of having power.
5.3.5.35	He places them in the eyes.

5.3.5.43	For them these bricks were laid down, the Varsh-chandas and the Varish-chandas.
5.3.5.44	They laid them down.
5.3.5.45	By means of them they went to the heavenly world.
5.3.5.46	When he lays down these bricks,
5.3.5.47	he goes to the heavenly world by means of those very chandas which are heavenly.
5.3.5.48	By means sacrifice Prajapati created beings.
5.3.5.49	They created them with the Stomabhāga bricks.
5.3.5.50	When one lays down the Stomabhäga bricks,
5.3.5.51	one creates offspring.
5.3.5.52	Indeed, Brihaspati brought together the brilliance of this sacrifice in the Stomabhåga bricks.
5.3.5.53	 When one lays down the Stomäbhäga bricks.
5.3.5.54	One builds a fire with brilliance.
5.3.5.55	Brihaspati saw this foundation of the sacrifice, namely the Stomabhāgas.
5.3.5.56	When he lays down the Stomabhägas,
5.3.5.57	it is for the foundation of the sacrifice.
5.3.5.58	He lays down seven times seven,
5.3.5.59	for the sake of heroic power.
5.3.5.60	Three in the middle,

5.3.6.3	"He placed the thunderbolt on the right side, saying, 'For Indra, for Indra, you win.'
5.3.6.4	For Abhijit.
5.3.6.5	He created those beings without breath.
5.3.6.6	He placed the breath in them, saying, 'You are the lord of them.' He placed the out-breath, saying, 'Move.' He placed the eye, saying, 'The protector of life.' He placed the ear.
5.3.6.7	Those creatures, seeing and hearing, did not become united.
5.3.6.8	He placed the union in them by saying, "You are the three-fold one."
5.3.6.9	Those creatures, becoming united, did not procreate.
5.3.6.10	He made them procreate by saying, "Thou art the growth, thou art the increase."
5.3.6.11	Those creatures that were born did not stand firm.
5.3.6.12	He established them in these worlds, saying, "You are Vasu, you are Vesa-shri, you are Vasya-shti."
5.3.6.13	When he says, "You are Vasa, you are Vesh-shri, and you are Vasya shti," he establishes the offspring in these worlds.
5.3.6.14	He who knows this, becomes immortal through the Prāṇa and Apāna.
5.3.7.1	The gods went to the heavenly world by means of the Nakṣatras.
5.3.7.2	That is the nature of the Nakṣatra.
5.3.7.3	When he places the Nakṣatralayers, the sacrificer goes to the heavenly world through the Nakṣatrathe Nakṣatras.
5.3.7.4	The world of heaven is the sky.
5.3.7.5	For him for whom these are laid down, there is no lack of heaven.
5.3.7.6	The abode of the sacrificer is the sky-seat.
5.3.7.7	When he lays down the sky-seat, he makes it an abode for the sacrificer.
5.3.7.8	This is the collected splendour of the back-verses, the sky-seat.
5.3.7.9	When he places the Naikasada, he secures the brilliance of the backs.
5.3.7.10	He places five-pronged ones.
5.3.7.11	The Apsarases indeed come to him in this world.
5.3.7.12	And they are indeed the life-giving waters of the sacrificer.
5.3.7.13	If one hates someone, one should place them and think of him.
5.3.7.14	One thus hurls him to these deities.
5.3.7.15	He is immediately afflicted with grief.
5.3.7.16	He places the northern ones in the heaven-like (bricks).
5.3.7.17	Just as one brings a wife and settles her in the house, so it is.
5.3.7.18	He places (the bricks) in the eastern direction, the last one in the northern direction.
5.3.7.19	Therefore the wife follows from the west to the east.
5.3.7.20	He places two bricks, the self-born and the diagonal, in the northern direction.
5.3.7.21	Prāṇa is the self-supporting brick.
5.3.7.22	Āyu is the corner brick.

5.3.7.24	Therefore, Prāṇa and Āayu are the supreme among vital breaths.
5.3.7.25	One should not place any other brick above it.
5.3.7.26	If one were to place any other brick on top, one would place the life and breath of the animals and the sacrificer.
5.3.7.27	Therefore, the bricks of the upper layer are not different.
5.3.7.28	He places the bricks of the self-layer.
5.3.7.29	This is the self-layer indeed.
5.3.7.30	He places it here.

5.3.7.35	It becomes the self-layer.
5.3.7.36	for the release of the vital airs.
5.3.7.37	And for the fame of the world of heaven.

5.3.7.40	gods.

5.3.9.2	If he were to place the bricks in pairs, the deities would deprive him of Agni.
5.3.9.3	When he lays down the Sajuṣṭha bricks, he builds him (Agni) with his own self.
5.3.9.4	He is not hindered by Agni.
5.3.9.5	And as a man is connected by his sinews, so is Agni connected by these (bricks).
5.3.9.6	By Agni the gods went to the heavenly world.
5.3.9.7	They became the Kriti stars.
5.3.9.8	He who lays down these (bricks) goes to the heavenly world.
5.3.9.9-17	it goes to light. It becomes variegated. He lays down the circular bricks. These worlds are the circular bricks. These worlds are the cities of the gods. He enters the cities of the Gods. One who is performing the Agnihotra does not suffer any distress. He lays the Viśva-jyotiṣa bricks. He makes these worlds luminous by these (bricks).
5.3.9.18	Then indeed he bestows on the sacrificer these very breaths.
5.3.9.19	These are the deities leading to heaven.
5.3.9.20	Approaching them, one goes to the heavenly world.
5.3.10.1	He places the 'Rain-bestowing' bricks.
5.3.10.2	He indeed secures rain.
5.3.10.3	If he were to place them in one layer, it would rain in one season.
5.3.10.4	He places them in layers.
5.3.10.5	Therefore it rains in all seasons.
5.3.10.6	"You are like the wind in front," he says.
5.3.10.7	This is the form of rain.
5.3.10.8	By means of the form, he wins rain.
5.3.10.9	The gods reached these worlds by means of the Samyani (bricks).
5.3.10.10	That is why the Samyani (are called) Samyani.
5.3.10.11	When one lays down the Samyani bricks, it is as if one reaches these worlds by means (of the Samyani) as one reaches the worlds by means of a boat on water.
5.3.10.12	The Samyani is indeed a raft for Agni.
5.3.10.13	When he places the Samyani, he places a raft for Agni
5.3.10.14	When they carry Agni to the places where these bricks are placed,
5.3.10.15	his Agni is not carried away.
5.3.10.16	He places the Aditya bricks.
5.3.10.17	The Adityas indeed push away from prosperity one who is worthy of prosperity but does not attain it.
5.3.10.18	The Adityas indeed lead him to prosperity.
5.3.10.19	The sun indeed takes away the lustre of him who, having built a fire-altar, does not shine.
5.3.10.20	When he places the Adityas bricks, the sun indeed bestows lustre on him.
5.3.10.21	Just as he shines among the gods, so does he shine among men.
5.3.10.22	He lays down bricks smeared with ghee.
5.3.10.23	Ghee is indeed Agni's beloved abode.
5.3.10.24	He thus makes him prosper with his beloved abode.
5.3.10.25	And also with brilliance.
5.3.10.26	He lays them down in succession.
5.3.10.27	He thus places brilliance in him without any deficiency.
5.3.10.28	Prajapati created Agni.
5.3.10.29	He became famous.
5.3.10.30	He saw these (bricks) called Yashoda.
5.3.10.31	He placed them.
5.3.10.32	By them he placed fame in himself.
5.3.10.33	When one places the Yashoda bricks,
5.3.10.34	the sacrificer places fame in himself by them.
5.3.10.35	One places five (bricks).
5.3.10.36	Man is fivefold.
5.3.10.37	As much as a man, he bestows fame in him.
5.3.11.1	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in battle.
5.3.11.2	The gods were fewer, the Asuras were more.
5.3.11.3	The gods saw these bricks.
5.3.11.4	They laid them down.
5.3.11.5	"He is more and more," (saying this) they became more, with trees and plants."
5.3.11.6	"He is the protector," (saying this), they conquered the earth.
5.3.11.7	"He conquered the eastern direction."
5.3.11.8	"He conquered the upward direction."
5.3.11.9	"You are in the space."
5.3.11.10	"He conquers the space."
5.3.11.11	He conquered the space.
5.3.11.12	Then the gods became victorious, the Asuras were defeated.
5.3.11.13	He who has these (bricks) placed (in the altar) becomes more prosperous.
5.3.11.14	He conquers the worlds.
5.3.11.15	He becomes prosperous by himself.
5.3.11.16	His enemy is destroyed.
5.3.11.17	You are seated on water.
5.3.11.18	He says, "You are seated on a hawk."
5.3.11.19	This is the form of Agni.
5.3.11.20	He wins Agni by means of his form.
5.3.11.21	He says "I place you in the wealth of the earth."
5.3.11.22	He makes these worlds wealthy.
5.3.11.23	He places the life-giving ones.
5.3.11.24	He places the life in him.
5.3.11.25	He says, "O Agni, your supreme heart is called by name."
5.3.11.26	This is indeed Agni's beloved abode.
5.3.11.27	He attains his beloved abode.
5.3.11.28	"Come, both of us."
5.3.11.29	He says, "Come, both of you."
5.3.11.30	He spreads it around.
5.3.11.31	"O Agni, you are invited among the five classes of people."
5.3.11.32	This is the five-fold Agni, the one with five layers.
5.3.11.33	Therefore he says this.
5.3.11.34	He places it with the Rtuvyas.
5.3.11.35	This is the dear abode of the seasons, namely the Rtuvyās.
5.3.11.36	He obtains the dear abode of seasons.
5.3.11.37	He says, "Sumeka."
5.3.11.38	Sumeka is indeed the year.
5.3.11.39	He attains the dear abode of the year itself.
5.3.12.1	Prajapati's eye fell out.
5.3.12.2	It fell down.
5.3.12.3	It became a horse.
5.3.12.4	What fell out, that is the horsehood of the horse.
5.3.12.5	The gods then restored it by means of the horse sacrifice.
5.3.12.6	He who performs the horse sacrifice makes Prajapati whole.
5.3.12.7	He becomes whole.
5.3.12.8	This is the expiation for all.
5.3.12.9	This is the remedy for all.
5.3.12.10	The gods crossed all evil by this.
5.3.12.11	Or by this they crossed even the sin of killing a brahmin.
5.3.12.12	One crosses all evil.
5.3.12.13	One crosses the sin of killing brahmins, he who performs the horse sacrifice, and he who knows this.
5.3.12.14	The horse was born from the eye of Prajapati.
5.3.12.15	Therefore they offer the horse's oblation to the north, and the other animals' oblations to the south.
5.3.12.16	The horse is offered on a Vitex twig.
5.3.12.17	The horse has its origin in water.
5.3.12.18	The Vitex has its origin in the water.
5.3.12.19	He establishes it in its own origin.
5.3.12.20	The Stoma is four-fold.
5.3.12.21	The horse's thigh was torn by a Saradha.
5.3.12.22	The gods then established it by means of the four-stoma (hymn).
5.3.12.23	That it is a hymn of four stomas,
5.3.12.24	is for the completeness of the horse.
5.4.1.1	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
5.4.1.2	They did not conquer.
5.4.1.3	Indra saw these (hymns) as his own body.
5.4.1.4	He adopted them.
5.4.1.5	By means of them he placed his own body, strength and energy.
5.4.1.6	Then the gods became victorious and the Asuras lost.
5.4.1.7	When he lays down the Indra-body, he thereby bestows on the sacrificer his own body, his own strength, his own power.
5.4.1.8	And he builds up Agni with Indra, with the body.
5.4.1.9	He becomes himself.
5.4.1.10	His foe becomes inferior to him.
5.4.1.11	The sacrifice fled from the gods.
5.4.1.12	They were not able to restrain it.
5.4.1.13	They saw these sacrificial bodies.
5.4.1.14	They placed them.
5.4.1.15	By means of them they obtained the sacrifice.
5.4.1.16	When one places the Yajnatanu (bricks), the sacrificer obtains the sacrifice by means of them.
5.4.1.17	He places thirty-three (bricks).
5.4.1.18	There are thirty-three deities.
5.4.1.19	He obtains the deities.
5.4.1.20	And he builds up Agni with his own self and with his own body.
5.4.1.21	He who knows this becomes possessed of light in the other world.
5.4.1.22	He lays down the Jyotishmatis (bricks).
5.4.1.23	He places light in him.
5.4.1.24	By these the Agni is kindled.
5.4.1.25	He kindles him by them.
5.4.1.26	He has light for both worlds.
5.4.1.27	He lays the Nakṣatreshtkas (bricks).
5.4.1.28	These are the lights of heaven.
5.4.1.29-35	He indeed wins them. The stars are indeed the well-done lights. He indeed wins them. And he makes these lights shine forth. For the attainment of the world of heaven. If one were to place them touching each other, one would cause rain to fall and the rain would not fall. He places them not touching each other.
5.4.2.5	The middle layer is like the unstable (earth).
5.4.2.6	It is like the atmosphere.
5.4.2.7	He places two layers in pairs, and four in the middle.
5.4.2.8	For stability.
5.4.2.9	The layers are like the internal space (of the earth).
5.4.2.10	When he places the layers, he places them for the stability of the layers.
5.4.2.11	He places the Avakā layer.
5.4.2.12	This is the womb of Agni.
5.4.2.13	He builds Agni with its own womb.
5.4.2.14	Vishvamitra said:
5.4.2.15	"He who knows this, he gives food to the Brahman. He who knows this,
5.4.2.16	The year pushes him back from the foundation, he who, having built the fire, does not establish himself.
5.4.2.17	There are five earlier layers.
5.4.2.18	Then he lays down the sixth layer.
5.4.2.19	The year has six seasons.
5.4.2.20	He finds support in the seasons and the year.
5.4.2.21	These are the bricks called 'Adhipatni'.
5.4.2.22	He who lays them down becomes the overlord of his equals.
5.4.2.23	He should meditate on the one whom he hates.
5.4.2.24	He is indeed destroyed by these very deities.
5.4.2.25	He is afflicted.
5.4.2.26	The Angirases, going to the heavenly world, brought back the atonement of the sacrifice to the sages.
5.4.2.27	That became gold.
5.4.2.28	When he sprinkles with gold scales, it is for the atonement of the sacrificial rite.
5.4.2.29	And he also makes a remedy for him.
5.4.2.30	And he prospers him with his form.
5.4.2.31	Then indeed he goes to the heavenly world by means of the golden light.
5.4.2.32	He sprinkles with a thousandfold (water).
5.4.2.33	Prajapati is a thousandfold.
5.4.2.34	For the attainment of Prajapati.
5.4.2.35	He says, "May these bricks of mine be cows."
5.4.2.36	He makes them cows.
5.4.2.37	They stand near him in the other world, giving what is desired.
5.4.3.1	Agni is indeed Rudra.
5.4.3.2	He is born now when he is completely burnt.
5.4.3.3	Just as a calf, when born, seeks the teat, so does he now seek his share.
5.4.3.4	If one does not offer oblation to him, one should think of the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer.
5.4.3.5	One offers the oblation to the hundred Rudras.
5.4.3.6	He appeases him with his share.
5.4.3.7	The Adhvaryu and the sacrificer do not suffer any distress.
5.4.3.8	If one were to offer with the milk of domestic animals, one would consign domestic animals to the fire.
5.4.3.9	If one offers with the milk of wild animals, one would (consign) wild animals.
5.4.3.10	One should offer with barley or with barley mixed with cow's urine.
5.4.3.11	One does not harm domestic animals or wild animals.
5.4.3.12	Now they say, the Jartilas and Gavadukas are not offerings.
5.4.3.13	One offers with goat's milk.
5.4.3.14	This is indeed for Agni, for the goat is for Agni.
5.4.3.15	One offers by means of an offering.
5.4.3.16	One does not harm domestic animals nor wild animals.
5.4.3.17	The Angirasas, going to the heavenly world, poured the Gharm into the goat.
5.4.3.18	She lamented and threw away the leaf.
5.4.3.19	That became the sun.
5.4.3.20	That is the reason why the sun is called Arka.
5.4.3.21	One offers oblations with the Arka leaf.
5.4.3.22	For the sake of having the same origin.
5.4.3.23	One offers standing towards the north.
5.4.3.24	This is the direction of Rudra.
5.4.3.25	One appeases Rudra in his own direction.
5.4.3.26	One offers on the last brick.
5.4.3.27	At the very end he offers to Rudra.
5.4.3.28	He offers divided into three parts.
5.4.3.29	These are the three worlds.
5.4.3.30	He makes these worlds equal in strength.
5.4.3.31	He first offers here,
5.4.3.32	then there,
5.4.3.33	and then there.
5.4.3.34	These are three worlds.
5.4.3.35	From these worlds he appeases him.
5.4.3.36	He offers three northern oblations.
5.4.3.37	Six are accomplished.
5.4.3.38	Six are the seasons.
5.4.3.39	He appeases him with the seasons.
5.4.3.40	If one were to offer in succession, one would make Rudra wander in between.
5.4.3.41	And indeed they say, "In which direction is Rudra?"
5.4.3.42	One should offer in succession.
5.4.3.43	He appeasess him by not wandering around.
5.4.3.44	These are the gods who go to heaven, the highest.
5.4.3.45	He makes the sacrificer recite them.
5.4.3.46	He sends him to heaven by means of them.
5.4.3.47	If one hates someone, one should place the animals of his herd in the path of that one.
5.4.3.48	The animal that stands first suffers misfortune.
5.4.4.1	He sprinkles (the animal) with the formula, "O stone, give nourishment."
5.4.4.2	He cleanses it.
5.4.4.3	Then indeed he satisfies him.
5.4.4.4	He who is satisfied, not hungry, not grieving, stands in that world.
5.4.4.5	He who knows this is satisfied with offspring and cattle.
5.4.4.6	He says, "The Maruts, rejoicing, give you food and strength."
5.4.4.7	Food is strength.
5.4.4.8	The Maruts are food.
5.4.4.9	He indeed obtains food.
5.4.4.10	"May the ash of him whom we hate fall on him." So he says.
5.4.4.11	He causes him whom he hates to be afflicted with hunger and grief.
5.4.4.12	He goes around sprinkling three times.
5.4.4.13	Agni is threefold.
5.4.4.14	He appeases the grief of Agni as much as he is.
5.4.4.15	He goes round again three times.
5.4.4.16	Six are completed.
5.4.4.17	There are six seasons.
5.4.4.18	He pacifies his impurity with the seasons.
5.4.4.19	This is the flower of the waters, namely the willow.
5.4.4.20	The Avaka is the arrow of the waters.
5.4.4.21	He draws with a willow branch and Avakas.
5.4.4.22	The waters are indeed peaceful.
5.4.4.23	He pacifiies his impurity with the peaceful ones.
5.4.4.24	Or, if any animal first approaches the fire that has been kindled, it is the lord who burns him with grief.
5.4.4.25	He drags it with a frog.
5.4.4.26	This is the animal that cannot be used by others.
5.4.4.27	It is not useful among domestic animals or wild animals.
5.4.4.28	He throws it into the fire.
5.4.4.29	He drags with eight (verses).
5.4.4.30	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
5.4.4.31	Agni is Gayatri.
5.4.4.32	As much as the fire, so much does it pacify the impurity.
5.4.4.33	With the verses containing the word 'pavak' (fire).
5.4.4.34	Food is fire.
5.4.4.35	By food, he pacifies his impurity.
5.4.4.36	Death is indeed fire.
5.4.4.37	The black antelope skin is the form of Brahman.
5.4.4.38	He puts on the black antelope skin and black sandals.
5.4.4.39	He hides death by means of Brahman.
5.4.4.40	They say, "He places him within death, within food."
5.4.4.41	"He releases one and not the other."
5.4.4.42	"He places him within the very death, he secures the very food."
5.4.4.43	"Salutations to your radiance, O destroyer."
5.4.4.44	"Having paid homage, they serve the superior."
5.4.4.45	"May others than us be scorched by your wrath."
5.4.4.46	He offers it to the one he hates.
5.4.4.47	He says, "May Pavaka be auspicious to us."
5.4.4.48	Pavaka is food.
5.4.4.49	He obtains food.

5.4.5.2	With a verse in the Paṅkti metre, he begins the sacrifice.
5.4.5.3	He recites with the Akshnas verse.
5.4.5.4	Therefore, animals strike the limbs with the Akshnasa verse.
5.4.5.5	For stability.
5.4.5.6	If he were to recite the Vasat call, his Vasat call would be exhausted.
5.4.5.7	If he does not recite the Vasat, the Rakshas would destroy the sacrifice.
5.4.5.8	He says "Vada".
5.4.5.9	He recites the Vasat call indirectly.
5.4.5.10	His Vasat-call is not wasted, and the Rakshas do not destroy the sacrifice.
5.4.5.11	The gods who are eaters of oblations are different from those who are not eaters of oblations.
5.4.5.12	He pleases both of them by the Agnihotra.
5.4.5.13	He sprinkles with curds mixed with honey, saying, "To the gods who are gods."
5.4.5.14	The sacrificer pleases the gods who are eaters and those who are not.
5.4.5.15	They delight the sacrificer.
5.4.5.16	One delights Hutadā with curds.
5.4.5.17	One delights Sahutadā with honey.
5.4.5.18	Curds is the food of the village.
5.4.5.19	Honey is the food of forest.
5.4.5.20	When one sprinkles with curds mixed with honey, it is for the securing of both.
5.4.5.21	One sprinkles with a handful of grass.
5.4.5.22	A handful of grass is Prajāpati.
5.4.5.23	For the sake of being of the same origin.

5.4.5.29	He says, "You are the givers of life, you are the givers (of life) to the out-breath."
5.4.5.30	He indeed places the life in himself.
5.4.5.31	He says (the verse), "You are the giver of splendour, you are the giver of wealth."
5.4.5.32	The offspring is the radiance.
5.4.5.33	The cattle is the wealth.
5.4.5.34	He places offspring and cattle in himself.
5.4.5.35	Indra killed Vritra.
5.4.5.36	Vritra, having been killed, was cut with sixteen cuts by the sword.
5.4.5.37	He saw this oblation to Agni, the leader,
5.4.5.38	and offered it.
5.4.5.39	Agni, the leader of the army, being pleased with his own share, burnt sixteen parts of Vritra.
5.4.5.40	He was freed from sin by Visvakarman.
5.4.5.41	When one offers oblation to Agni, the leader, Agni, the leader himself, being pleased with its own share, burns away the sin.
5.4.5.42	One is freed from sin by the Vaisva-darmāṇī.
5.4.5.43	If one wishes that someone should be freed from sin for a long time, one should offer each of them.
5.4.5.44	One is freed from sin for long time.
5.4.5.45	If one wants that someone should be immediately freed from sin, one should offer all of them in succession.

5.4.6.3	He places three (kindling woods).
5.4.6.4	Agni is threefold.
5.4.6.5-12	He makes the Agni-portion as much as the Agni-fire. They are made of Udumbara wood. Udumbara is energy. He places energy in him. He says, "The All-gods have raised you." The All-gods are the vital airs. He raises him with the vital airs. He says, "May Agni bear with his thoughts."
5.4.6.13	He who is the most powerful of all, he alone makes him prosper.
5.4.6.14	He says, "The goddesses of the five directions protect the sacrifice."
5.4.6.15	For he moves along the directions.

5.4.6.29	Fire is food.
5.4.6.30	He obtains food.
5.4.6.31	The gods and the demons were engaged in a battle.
5.4.6.32	The gods saw this chariot that cannot be countered.
5.4.6.33	With it they conquered the demons.
5.4.6.34	That is why it is called the chariot that cannot be counterred.
5.4.6.35	The second Hotr recites the Apratiratha (hymn). By that the sacrificer conquers his enemies.
5.4.6.36	And he conquers what is not conquered.

5.4.7.31	He makes him go to the extent of Agni.
5.4.7.32	He places an Udumbara branch, saying, "Agni, burning, shine in front of us."
5.4.7.33	This is the Sūrmī with the ear-like ends.
5.4.7.34	By means of this the gods destroyed the hundred enemies of the Asuras.
5.4.7.35	When he lays down the kindling wood with this (verse), the sacrificer strikes his foe with the hundred-striking thunderbolt.

5.4.7.40	"He says, "The variegated one of Savitar, the desirable one," of the Shami tree.
5.4.7.41	For peace.
5.4.7.42	Indeed, Agni milks the one who builds the fire altar, and the one who builds fire altar milks Agni.
5.4.7.43	He says, "the variegated one of Savita, the desirable one."
5.4.7.44	This is Agni's milking.
5.4.7.45	Kanva Sravasa knew this.
5.4.7.46	He indeed milks him with that.
5.4.7.47	When he adds fuel with this (verse),

5.4.7.56	For the creation of beings.
5.4.7.57	Agni went forth from the gods.
5.4.7.58	He entered the directions.
5.4.7.59	One should meditate on the directions with the mind while offering.
5.4.7.60	He is indeed obtained from the directions.
5.4.7.61	He offers with curds in front.
5.4.7.62	With ghee above.
5.4.7.63	And he places the lustre and the power of Indra in the right place.

5.4.7.66	The year is Agni Vaiśvānaran.
5.4.7.67	He directly obtains Vaiśvānāra.
5.4.7.68	If one were to perform the Prayāja and Anūyāja offerings, that would be a disruption of the sacrifice.
5.4.7.69	He performs the Darvihoma offering.
5.4.7.70	For the establishment of the sacrifice.
5.4.7.71	Vaisvānara is the kingdom.

5.4.7.73	Having offered to Vaisvānara, one offers to the Maruts.
5.4.7.74	One binds the people to the kingdom itself.
5.4.7.75	One proclaims Vaisvānaran loudly.
5.4.7.76	One offers to the Marutas in a low voice.
5.4.7.77	Therefore one speaks above the people in the kingdom.
5.4.7.78	They become Maruts.
5.4.7.79	The Maruts are the group of gods.
5.4.7.80	He wins for him the human group by means of the divine group.

5.4.8.19	By the form alone he obtains food
5.4.8.20	He says, “Fire and water are mine.”
5.4.8.21	This is the source of food.
5.4.8.22	He obtains food by its source.
5.4.8.23	He offers half of the Indra-shares.
5.4.8.24	He indeed wins the deities.
5.4.8.25	Since Indra is half of all (deities), therefore Indra is the most important among the deities.
5.4.8.26	He says 'Indra' last.
5.4.8.27	He indeed places the power above him.
5.4.8.28	He offers the sacrificial implements.
5.4.8.29	The sacrificial implements are indeed the sacrifice.
5.4.8.30	He indeed gains the sacrifice.
5.4.8.31-36	Now this is the form of the sacrifice. He wins the sacrifice by its form. "He says, "Avabhrtha and my own doing." For the purpose of his own doing." "He says "Agni and my heat." This is the form of Brahman-splendour." He wins Brahman-splendore by its form. He says, "My Rik and my Saman."

5.4.8.54	He indeed wins animals for him by means of Jagati.
5.4.8.55	"He offers twelve times, saying, "Vajas and Prasavas."
5.4.8.56	Twelve months are a year.
5.4.8.57	He indeed stands firm in the year.
5.4.9.1	Agni, desiring a share, departed from the gods.
5.4.9.2	The gods said to him, "Come back to us, carry our oblations."
5.4.9.3	He said, "I choose a boon: those who offer to me should offer the Vāja-prasavīya."
5.4.9.4	Therefore they offer the Vāja prasavīya to Agni.
5.4.9.5	When he offers with the Vāja-prasavīya (oblation), he thereby propitiates Agni with a share.
5.4.9.6	And it is indeed an anointment of him.
5.4.9.7	He offers with fourteen (oblations).
5.4.9.8	There are fourteen oblations: seven belonging to the village and seven belonging to the forest, for the inclusion of both.
5.4.9.9	He offers at each kind of food, for the inclusion at each kind offood.
5.4.9.10	He offers by means of a spoon made of Udumbara wood.
5.4.9.11	The Udumbara is indeed energy.
5.4.9.12	Energy is food.
5.4.9.13	One indeed obtains energy and food through energy.
5.4.9.14	Agni is indeed consecrated among the gods.
5.4.9.15	Agni among men.
5.4.9.16	Therefore one should not run when it rains on an Agni-altar.
5.4.9.17	For his food is obtained.
5.4.9.18	Indeed, rain is like food.
5.4.9.19	If he were to run from food, he should run back.
5.4.9.20	He should turn back.
5.4.9.21	He turns back to food.
5.4.9.22	He offers with the milk of a black cow with a white calf, saying, "To the Night and to the Dawn."
5.4.9.23	He gives him the night by day.

5.4.9.26-33	The bearers of the kingdom offer. He indeed wins the kingdom. He offers with six (verses). There are six seasons. He indeed stands firm in the seasons. He offers five oblations in the Rathamukha (oblation) with the words, "O lord of the world." The chariot is indeed the thunderbolt. By means of the thunderbolt, he indeed conquers the directions.
5.4.9.34-41	In the other world, indeed, the wind blows over the fire-altar. He offers with the names of the wind. The wind blows over him in the other world. He offers three times. These are the three worlds. He obtains the wind from these worlds. He says, "Thou art the ocean, the shining one." This is the form of the wind.

5.4.9.43	He offers with joined palms.
5.4.9.44	For these offerings cannot be made otherwise.
5.4.10.1	The divine chariot is yoked for the heavenly world, where the human chariot is not yoked.
5.4.10.2	This indeed is the divine chariot, namely, Agni.
5.4.10.3	He says, "I yoke Agni with strength and ghee."
5.4.10.4	He indeed yokes him.
5.4.10.5-9	He carries him to the world of heaven. If one were to yoke with all five, then Agni would be yoked and fall away, the offerings would be unestablished, the Stotras would be unestablished. The Utkhas would be unestablished.
5.4.10.10	As much as the fire, so much he yokes.
5.4.10.11	Just as a chariot is yoked and then placed, so do the oblations stand in response, the praises in response, the eulogies in response.
5.4.10.12	At the Yajñāyajñiya Stotra, one touches with two (verses).
5.4.10.13	This much is the sacrifice, as much as the Agniṣṭoma.
5.4.10.14	You are made to be above this earth.
5.4.10.15	As far as the sacrifice extends, he mounts it at the end.
5.4.10.16	By two (verses) for stability.
5.4.10.17	By one (verse) it becomes unmentioned.
5.4.10.18	Then he touches (the fire).
5.4.10.19	The subsequent sacrifice bows down to him.
5.4.10.20	And for continuity.
5.4.10.21	Indeed, he who builds a fire-altar moves away from this world.
5.4.10.22	No oblation is suitable for him who has not built the fire-altar.
5.4.10.23	The oblation that he offers on the Anishtaka is a flowing one.
5.4.10.24	The sacrifice follows that flowing oblation, the sacrificer follows the sacrifice.
5.4.10.25	If one were to build the fire-altar again, it would be for the establishment of the oblations.
5.4.10.26	The oblations stand firm.
5.4.10.27	The sacrifice does not follow, the sacrificer does not follow.
5.4.10.28	He lays down eight (bricks).
5.4.10.29	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
5.4.10.30	He builds him with the Gayatri metre.

5.4.10.32	If it be twelve, then with the Jagati.
5.4.10.33	He builds him with the metres.
5.4.10.34	This Agni is called Napat.
5.4.10.35	He who knowing thus builds the Napat, eats food from the third person.
5.4.10.36	As the re-installation is, so is the Napat.
5.4.10.37	One who does not prosper by the Agni-installation rite, performs it again.
5.4.10.38	One who does not prosper after building the fire, builds it again.
5.4.10.39	When one builds it again, it is for prosperity.
5.4.10.40	But some say that one should not build it again.
5.4.10.41	For Agni is indeed Rudra.
5.4.10.42	Just as one awakens a sleeping tiger, so is it.
5.4.10.43	Then indeed they say, "One should perform the Chetavyā."
5.4.10.44	As one awakens the deity with the offering material, so it is.
5.4.10.45	Manu built the fire.
5.4.10.46	He did not succeed with it.
5.4.10.47	He saw this additional building.
5.4.10.48	He built it.
5.4.10.49	With it he succeeded.
5.4.10.50	When one builds the additional building, it is for success.

5.4.11.14	One pushes away one's enemies.
5.4.11.15	One who wishes should build an altar on both sides.
5.4.11.16-23	One should drive away the born enemies. One should drive away the enemies who are about to be born. One drives away the born enemies, and the enemies who are going to be born. One should build a chariot-wheel-shaped altar for one who has enemies. The chariot is indeed the thunderbolt. One strikes the enemies with the thunderbolt. He who desires food should build an altar shaped like a pot.
5.4.11.24-31	Food is offered to Drona. One obtains food with its source. One desiring cattle should build a mound. One becomes cattle-possessing. One desiring a village should build a mound around. One becomes a villager. One desiring, "May I prosper in the world of the ancestors," should build a mound at a cremation ground.

5.4.11.33	Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni competed with Vasiṣṭha.
5.4.11.34	He, Jamadagni, saw these (verses) for himself.
5.4.11.35	He took them up.
5.4.11.36	By means of them he overcame the power and strength of Vasiṣṭhas.
5.4.11.37	When one lays down the Vihavya verses,
5.4.11.38	the sacrificer overcomes the power and strength (of his enemy) by means of them.
5.4.11.39	He places the Hotr's Dhishniya.
5.4.11.40	The Hotr is the place of the sacrificer.

5.4.11.42	He places twelve (bricks).

5.5.1.22	What is on the other side is the form of cows.
5.5.1.23	The hair like the tail is the form of goats.
5.5.1.24	The hair of the goat is the form of she-goats.
5.5.1.25	Vayu is the beloved abode of animals.
5.5.1.26-31	When it is dedicated to Vayu, the animals stand near him, knowing him. They say that it should be dedicated to Prajapati. If one dedicates it to Vayu, one goes away from Prajapati. If one dedicates it to Prajapati, one goes away from Vayu. When the animal is dedicated to Vâyu, one does not go away from Vâyu.
5.5.1.32	When the cake to Prajapati is offered, he goes to Prajapati.
5.5.1.33	When it is in twelve potsherds, he goes to the Vaisvânaras.
5.5.1.34	One who is about to be initiated offers a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni-Vishnu.
5.5.1.35	Agni is all the deities.
5.5.1.36	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
5.5.1.37	He undertakes both the deities and the sacrifice.
5.5.1.38	Agni is the lowest of the deities, Vishnu is the highest.
5.5.1.39	When one offers the Agniavisnu offering on eleven potsherds, the sacrificer, having surrounded the deities on both sides, attains them.
5.5.1.40	The gods attained the other world by means of the cake, and this world by means of gruel.
5.5.1.41	One who desires, "May I attain the other world," should offer a cake.
5.5.1.42	He prospers in that very world.
5.5.1.43	Since it is made of eight potsherds, it is dedicated to Agni.
5.5.1.44	Since it has three potsherds, (it is dedicated) to Vishnu.
5.5.1.45	For prosperity.
5.5.1.46	If one desires, 'May I prosper in this world', one should make a rice-cake, ghee for Agni and rice for Vishnu.
5.5.1.47	Therefore, a rice-cake should be made.
5.5.1.48	One prospers in this very world.
5.5.1.49	The sun becomes (the fire).
5.5.1.50	This is Aditi.
5.5.1.51	He indeed stands in this (earth).
5.5.1.52	And he indeed performs the sacrifice in this (earth) itself.
5.5.1.53	He who builds the fire without having performed the Samvatsara sacrifice, he indeed suffers the misfortune as if a foetus is aborted.
5.5.1.54	One should offer a cake on twelve potsherds to Vaiśvānara Agni.
5.5.1.55	The year is indeed Agni Vaiśvānara.
5.5.1.56	Just as one is born when the time comes after having attained the year, so one builds the fire when the time comes having attained the year.
5.5.1.57	One does not suffer distress.
5.5.1.58	This is indeed Agni's dear body, namely Vaiśvānaran.
5.5.1.59	One obtains his dear body.
5.5.1.60	These are the three oblations.
5.5.1.61	These are the three worlds.
5.5.1.62	For the prosperity of these worlds.
5.5.2.1	Prajapati, having created the creatures, entered them with his mind.
5.5.2.2	He was unable to be born again from them.
5.5.2.3	He said, "May he prosper who will again create me from this."
5.5.2.4	The gods created him.
5.5.2.5	Then they succeeded.
5.5.2.6	What they constructed, that is the reason for the name of the sacrificial post.
5.5.2.7	He who, knowing this, constructs the fire, succeeds.
5.5.2.8	They say, "For whom is the fire constructed?"
5.5.2.9	The fire is constructed so that one may have fire.
5.5.2.10	One indeed has fire.
5.5.2.11-17	To whom is Agni set up? They say: "May the gods not know me," Agni is set up. The gods know him. To whom is Agni set? They say: " "May I be at home," Agni is set. He becomes at home. To whom does Agni set? They say:
5.5.2.18-25	"One who has cattle" is what Agni is being built for. One indeed becomes one who has cattle. They say, "For whom is Agni being built?" "Seven men who are to be supported" is what Agni being built for. There are three facing east, three facing west, and the self as the seventh. Those very ones support him in the other world.
5.5.2.26-33	Prajapati desired Agni. He said to her, "Do not desire Agni in me. He will burn me up. You will be burnt up by him and will be destroyed. You will become worse." He said, "I will do it in such a way that he will not burn you up." He touched her.
5.5.2.34	May Prajapati settle thee.
5.5.2.35	May it settle down like Angiras, with that deity.
5.5.2.36	Having made this the desired brick, he places it for non-burning.
5.5.2.37	If one were to build a fire altar, one should touch it.
5.5.2.38	May Prajapati settle you.
5.5.2.39	May it be settled like Angiras, by that deity.
5.5.2.40	 Having made this the desired bricks, he places them for non-burning.
5.5.2.41	Prajapati desired, 'May I beget offspring.'
5.5.2.42	He saw this Ukhā.
5.5.2.43	He observed it for a year.
5.5.2.44	Then he was born.
5.5.2.45	Therefore a wife gives birth to a child after a year.
5.5.2.46	The Vasus said to him,
5.5.2.47	'You have been born first.
5.5.2.48	We shall beget offspring.' They said.
5.5.2.49	He gave it to the Vasus.
5.5.2.50	They were afraid of him for three days.
5.5.2.51	He created three hundred and thirty (gods).
5.5.2.52	Therefore, a wife is born after three days.
5.5.2.53	The Rudras said to him:
5.5.2.54	"You were born first.
5.5.2.55	We are the creators of offspring."
5.5.2.56	They gave him to the Rudras.
5.5.2.57	They protected him for six days.
5.5.2.58	He created three hundred and thirty (gods).
5.5.2.59	Therefore, a man becomes a husband after six days.
5.5.2.60	The Adityas said to him,
5.5.2.61	"You were born from us.
5.5.2.62	We are the creators of offspring."
5.5.2.63	They gave him to the Adityas.
5.5.2.64	They were afraid of him for twelve days.
5.5.2.65	By him they created three hundred and thirty.
5.5.2.66	From him the twelve-day sacrifice is born.
5.5.2.67	By him alone they created a thousand, the thousandth Ukhā.
5.5.2.68	He who knows the thousandth Ukha thus obtains a thousand cattle.
5.5.3.1	The Ukhā is used with a Yajus, cooked with a Yajūs, and released with a Yajüs.
5.5.3.2	They say that the Ukhā is now exhausted and cannot be used again.
5.5.3.3	He offers on the Ukhā with the verse, "O Agni, yoke those who are thine, yoke those who have been invoked by the gods."
5.5.3.4	By that he uses it again.
5.5.3.5	By that it is exhausted.
5.5.3.6	He who yokes Agni when he comes, yokes him when he is being yoked, yokes him among those being yoked.
5.5.3.7	"He says, "O Agni, do thou yoke those who are thine, do thou yoke the divine messengers."
5.5.3.8	This is Agni's yoke.
5.5.3.9	With it he yokes him.
5.5.3.10	He yokes him among the yoked.
5.5.3.11	Brahmin scholars say, "Agni should be set up in a lying down position."
5.5.3.12	Agni is indeed the measure of the ages.
5.5.3.13	If one were to build it sloping downwards, the oblations would reach it from behind.
5.5.3.14	If it were sloping upwards, it would not be able to fall down, and he would not attain heaven.
5.5.3.15	He places it sloping towards the east, with the human body.
5.5.3.16	The oblations reach it from the front.
5.5.3.17	One does not build it sloping upwards.
5.5.3.18	He becomes one who has a good world.
5.5.3.19	He offers to Surya.
5.5.3.20	He restores sight to him.
5.5.3.21	He offers twice.
5.5.3.22	There are two eyes.
5.5.3.23	He offers with the same (verse).
5.5.3.24	The eye is the same. For prosperity.
5.5.3.25	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
5.5.3.26	They deposited the wealth of the left (with the gods).
5.5.3.27	The gods won it back from the left-holders.
5.5.3.28	The Vāmabhṛt is the Vāmabhara.
5.5.3.29	When he places the Vāma-bhara, the sacrificer with it seizes the wealth of his enemy.
5.5.3.30	It has a golden head.
5.5.3.31	Gold is light.
5.5.3.32	Light is the Vāmabhaṭa.
5.5.3.33	He seizes the light of his enemy with light.
5.5.3.34	It has two verses, for stability.
5.5.4.1	The waters were the wives of Varuna.
5.5.4.2	They were conceived by Agni.
5.5.4.3	They became one.
5.5.4.4	His seed fell down.
5.5.4.5	That became this (earth).
5.5.4.6	What fell down as the second, that became that (sky).
5.5.4.7	This is Viraj, that is Svaraj.
5.5.4.8	When he places Viraj and Svaraj, he places these two.
5.5.4.9	Or, what he (the husband) emits, that is deposited in her.
5.5.4.10	From that it is produced.
5.5.4.11	Those are the plants and herbs.
5.5.4.12	Those Agni eats.
5.5.4.13	He who knows thus, is born and becomes a nourisher of food.
5.5.4.14	If one is fertile, he should deposit both in the first layer of him.
5.5.4.15	These two, indeed, emit semen in him.
5.5.4.16	If he has had intercourse with his wife during the first half of her menstrual cycle, he should place the seed in the womb of another woman during the second half of her menstrual period.
5.5.4.17	He thus encloses the seed on both sides.
5.5.4.18	For a year he should not have intercourse with any woman.
5.5.4.19	For these two do not have intercourse with anyone.
5.5.4.20	This is their vow.
5.5.4.21	He who builds a fire without the head becomes headless in the other world.
5.5.4.22	He who builds a fire with the head becomes headed in the other world.
5.5.4.23	I offer the mind with ghee in the mind, as the gods came here by Vītihotra, the increasers of truth, on the path of the wind of the ocean, I offer to Viśvakarman, the immortal oblation to Viśvāhā. Having placed the naturally perforated stone, he offers.
5.5.4.24	This is indeed the head of Agni.
5.5.4.25	He builds Agni with the head.
5.5.4.26-31	He who knows this becomes in the world of heaven. This Agni is indeed being piled up for the world of heaven; Whatever is done to it contrary to the former practice, that is not conducive to heaven. Agni is conducive to heaven. One should touch the pile of bricks. The one who knows the pile and the non-pile, the one who knows well, like a garment on the back, the mortals with the Vritra.
5.5.4.32	"And for our prosperity and lordship, O god, grant us Diti and Aditi, and be long-lived."
5.5.4.33	He places her as before.
5.5.4.34	He builds him facing east.
5.5.4.35	He becomes one who goes to heaven.
5.5.5.1	Viśvakarman, lord of the directions,
5.5.5.2	May he protect our cattle.
5.5.5.3	May he protect us.
5.5.5.4	To him salutations.
5.5.5.5	Prajapati, Rudra, Varuna, Agni, the lord of directions.
5.5.5.6	May he protect our cattle.
5.5.5.7	May he save us.
5.5.5.8	To him be salutations.
5.5.5.9	These are the deities, the lords of these animals.
5.5.5.10	He who places the heads of animals is indeed sacrificed to them.
5.5.5.11	He places golden bricks.
5.5.5.12	He offers salutations to these very deities.
5.5.5.13	Brahma-knowers say:
5.5.5.14	One offers domestic animals in the fire and gives away wild ones. What is the benefit of that?
5.5.5.15	When one lays down golden bricks, gold is indeed immortality.
5.5.5.16	One makes a remedy for domestic animals with immortality.
5.5.5.17	He does not injure them.
5.5.5.18	Prāṇa is the first, Svayamatṛṇṇā; Vyāna is the second, Apāna is the third.
5.5.5.19	Having placed the first Svayamatṛnṇā after Prāṇā,
5.5.5.20	he prospers Prāṇa with Prāṇa itself.
5.5.5.21	Having placed it after Vyānā,
5.5.5.22	he prosper Vyāna with Vyāna itself.
5.5.5.23	Having put it after Apānā,
5.5.5.24	He makes the Apāna (breath) flourish with the Apāna (itself).
5.5.5.25	He kindles him with the Prāṇa (breath).
5.5.5.26	He places the Svayamatṛṇṇā bricks with the formulas, "Bhūr Bhuvah Suvar."
5.5.5.27	These worlds are the Svayamatrṇṇā.
5.5.5.28	It is by these Vyāhṛtis that Prajapati was born.
5.5.5.29	When he places these worlds with the Vyāhṛtis, he is born in these worlds.
5.5.5.30	For Prāṇa, Vyāna, Apāna, for speech, for sight, with that deity, like Angiras, be firm.
5.5.5.31	The gods indeed sought heaven through Agni.
5.5.5.32	They were not able to reach it.
5.5.5.33	They saw these four self-sprout bricks.
5.5.5.34	They placed them in the directions.
5.5.5.35	By that all-seeing eye they went to the world of heaven.
5.5.5.36	In that he places the four self-sprouting bricks in the directions, the sacrificer goes to the world of Heaven by that all-seeing (eye) and Agni.
5.5.6.1	He says, "O Agni, come hither, O Vīta."
5.5.6.2	He invites him.
5.5.6.3-10	"I choose Agni as the messenger," he says. He chooses him after having offered. "Agni is kindled by Agni," he says. He kindles him. "Agna has destroyed the foes," he says. In the kindled one, he places power. "O Agni, I have sung the praise," he says. The praise is sung.
5.5.6.11	These are the forms of the days.
5.5.6.12	He builds it every day.
5.5.6.13	He obtains the forms of the day.
5.5.6.14	The Brahmavadins say:
5.5.6.15	Why are the bricks called 'satyatya' (truthful) and 'ayatya' (truthless), while the Lokamprana (bricks) are called 'ayatya'?
5.5.6.16	One should say, 'Indra-Agni is in the Barhaspatya (bricks).'
5.5.6.17	Indra and Agni are the two gods, and Brihaspati is the one who has come.
5.5.6.18	It has followers, for immortality.
5.5.6.19	It follows the Anushtubh.
5.5.6.20	The Lokamprana is the self.
5.5.6.21	The Anushtubh is the breath.
5.5.6.22	Therefore the breath follows all the limbs.
5.5.6.23	They are his Soodadohas.
5.5.6.24	Therefore, the juice is the most excellent of the most excellent.
5.5.6.25	He says, "The Prisni ones drink Soma."
5.5.6.26	Prisni is food.
5.5.6.27	He indeed obtains food.
5.5.6.28	Agni is the sun.
5.5.6.29	The sun is food.
5.5.6.30	One indeed obtains food. 
5.5.6.31	He says, “The birth of the gods, the three shining worlds in heaven.”
5.5.6.32	He makes these worlds of him shining.
5.5.6.33	He who knows the foundation of the bricks stands firm.
5.5.6.34	He says, "May I be firm like Angiras with that deity."
5.5.6.35	This is the foundation of the Bricks.
5.5.6.36	He who thus knows stands firm.
5.5.7.1	The fire is piled for the heavenly world.
5.5.7.2	The thunderbolt is eleven-fold.
5.5.7.3	If one were to offer the Ekadasini oblation in the fire, he would be excluded from heaven by the thunderbolt.
5.5.7.4	If one were not to offer it, one would be deprived of cattle by the Svara.
5.5.7.5	One offers it on a single post.
5.5.7.6	He is not excluded from heaven by thunderbolt, nor is he deprived of cattle by Svara.
5.5.7.7-11	He who, while building a fire-altar, crosses the boundary, is deprived of his power and energy. One should place the bricks in the prescribed order. One is not deprived of one's power and energy. The fire is Rudra. His three directions are west, transverse and north.
5.5.7.12	For he who builds a fire is indeed excluded from them.
5.5.7.13	Having built the fire, one should give to a Brahman a bow with three arrows, unasked.
5.5.7.14	One pays homage to them alone.
5.5.7.15	And one redeems oneself from them alone.
5.5.7.16	"Whatever bow is in front of you, O Rudra, may the wind blow after it."
5.5.7.17	"To that, O Rudra," I pay homage to you with the year.
5.5.7.18	Whatever is your bow to the right, may the wind blow after it for you.
5.5.7.19	To that one, O Rudra, I bow with a year's devotion.
5.5.7.20	Whatever is your bow behind, may the wind follow it for you. 
5.5.7.21	To that one I bow with a month's devotion. O Rudra,
5.5.7.22	Whatever is your northern bow, may the wind flow after it for you.
5.5.7.23	To that Rudra, I bow down to you with a calf for a year.
5.5.7.24	Whatever bow of yours is above Rudra, may the wind blow after you.
5.5.7.25	To that Rudra, you bow down to you for a year. The bow of yours is below Rudra.
5.5.7.26	Rudra indeed is Agni.
5.5.7.27	Just as a tiger stands angrily, so does he now.
5.5.7.28	He stands near them with the collected (fire).
5.5.7.29	He appeases him with salutations.
5.5.7.30	Those fires that have entered the earth,
5.5.7.31	you are the best of them.
5.5.7.32	O Agni, you are the water with the mind.
5.5.7.33	O Agni you are the water through austerity.
5.5.7.34	O Agni! You are the water through consecration.
5.5.7.35	O Agni ! You are the water with Upasads.
5.5.7.36	O Agni You are the water by means of the Sutyas.
5.5.7.37	You are the water, O Agni, with the offerings.
5.5.7.38	You are the water, Agni, with the bath.
5.5.7.39	You are water, O Agni with the gift.
5.5.7.40	You are Agni, with the word 'svāhā', he says.
5.5.7.41	This is Agni's attainment.
5.5.7.42	By that alone he attains him.
5.5.8.1	He stands up in front with the Gāyatrī verse.
5.5.8.2	He places the breath in him.
5.5.8.3	The two verses from the Brihat and Rathantara Samans are the wings.
5.5.8.4	He places the strength in him.
5.5.8.5	With the Rtusthaya-Agnimanta verse he consecrates the tail.
5.5.8.6	He indeed stands firm in the seasons.
5.5.8.7	He consecrates with the Prstha verses.
5.5.8.8	The Prstha verses are indeed brilliance.
5.5.8.9	He places brilliance in him.
5.5.8.10	Prajapati created Agni.
5.5.8.11	He, being created, went away from him.
5.5.8.12	He restrained him with the Vāravantīya (verse).
5.5.8.13	That is the reason for the Vāravantyā being called Vāravantyä.
5.5.8.14	They made him fly with the Śyaitī (verse).
5.5.8.15	This is the reason for Śyaitī being called Śyaitī.
5.5.8.16	When one stands with the Vāravantiya (verse), one restrains him.
5.5.8.17	One makes him fly with the Syaitī (verse)
5.5.8.18	One stands facing the sun with the heart of Prajapati.
5.5.8.19	His measure alone goes.
5.5.8.20	I place you in the eastern direction.
5.5.8.21	With the Gayatri metre, with Agni as the deity, I place the head of Agni on the head of Agni.
5.5.8.22	I place thee in the southern direction.
5.5.8.23	With Trishtup metre, with Indra as the deity, with the wing of Agni, I place the wing of Agni.
5.5.8.24	With the western direction, I place thee.
5.5.8.25	With the Jagati metre, with Savitr as the deity, with the tail of Agni, I place the tail of Agni.
5.5.8.26	I place you in the northern direction.
5.5.8.27	With the Anushtubh metre, with Mitra-Varuna as the deity, I place the wing of Agni with the wing of Agni.
5.5.8.28	With the upward direction, I place you.
5.5.8.29	With the Paṅkti metre, with Brihaspati as the deity, with the back of Agni, I place the back of Agni.
5.5.8.30	He who builds a fire without self-knowledge becomes without self-knowledge in the other world.
5.5.8.31	He who performs with self-knowledge becomes with self-knowledge in this world.
5.5.8.32	One places the bricks with self-knowledge.
5.5.8.33	This is indeed the self of Agni.
5.5.8.34	He builds the fire with the self.
5.5.8.35	He who knows this becomes self-possessed in the other world.
6.1.1.1	He makes the eastern beam.
6.1.1.2	The gods, men, and the directions were divided, the east for the gods, the south for the fathers, the west for men, the north for Rudra.
6.1.1.3	When he makes the eastern beam, the sacrificer then turns towards the world of the gods.
6.1.1.4	He covers (the fire).
6.1.1.5	The world of the gods is hidden from the world of men.
6.1.1.6	They say, "One should not go from this world to the other world," for who knows whether there is or is not a world beyond?
6.1.1.7	He makes the two worlds shine forth, for victory over both worlds.
6.1.1.8	He shaves his hair and beard.
6.1.1.9	He cuts his nails.
6.1.1.10-15	The hair and beard are dead skin, and unclean. Having removed the dead skin, which is unclean, he becomes fit for sacrifice and attains to wisdom. The Angirases, going to the heavenly world, introduced the consecration and austerities in the waters. He bathes in the waters. He directly obtains the consecration and austerites. He batches at a sacred place.
6.1.1.16-24	They introduced her into the sacred place. One bathes in the sacred place. The sacred place is the same for all. One eats water. One becomes pure only when one has gone inside. One consecrates oneself with a garment. The garment is indeed Soma by its deity. One who consecrates himself approaches the deity Soma. He says, "You are the body of Soma, protect my body."
6.1.1.25	He approaches his own deity.
6.1.1.26	And he indeed prays for this blessing.
6.1.1.27	The Agnihotra is the Agnihotra of Agni.
6.1.1.28	The Vatapaana is the Vatapaana of Vayu.
6.1.1.29	The Nivi is the Nivi of the Pitrs.
6.1.1.30	The Praghata is the Praghata of the plants.
6.1.1.31	The Praachinaatanas is the Praachinaatanasa of the Adityas.
6.1.1.32	The Otu is the Otu of all the gods.
6.1.1.33	The Atikaasha is the Atikaasha of the stars.
6.1.1.34	Now, this garment is indeed all-divine.
6.1.1.35	When one consecrates with a garment, one consecrates him with all the deities.
6.1.1.36	Man is outside the breath.
6.1.1.37	His food is breath.
6.1.1.38	He eats.
6.1.1.39	One consecrates with breath.
6.1.1.40	One becomes nourished.
6.1.1.41	With whatever breath he has, he attains the intellect along with it.
6.1.1.42	Ghee is of the gods.
6.1.1.43	Butter is for the Pitrs.
6.1.1.44	Curd is for men.
6.1.1.45	Now, this clarified butter is indeed all-divine.
6.1.1.46	When one anoints with clarified butter, one pleases all the deities.
6.1.1.47	One who is consecrated has indeed fallen from this world and gone to the world of the gods.
6.1.1.48	Clarified butter is indeed in between.
6.1.1.49	Therefore, one anoints with butter.
6.1.1.50-58	In accordance with the Yajus, for the exclusion of the opponent. Indra killed Vritra. His eye fell down. That became collyrium. When one applies collyrium, one blinds the eye of the opponent. One should apply it on the right eye first. Because men apply it on the left eye first. One should not run. Because men run on the left.
6.1.1.59	One should apply it five times.
6.1.1.60	The Panchati (verse) has five syllables.
6.1.1.61	The sacrifice is Panchati.
6.1.1.62	One obtains the sacrifice.
6.1.1.63	One should apply it in a limited way.
6.1.1.64	For humans apply it in an unlimited way.
6.1.1.65	One should use a cotton swab.
6.1.1.66	For humans use a cotton swab for exclusion.
6.1.1.67	If one were to use a cotton swab, it would be like a thunderbolt.
6.1.1.68	He anoints with a tuft of grass for friendship.
6.1.1.69	Indra killed Vritra.
6.1.1.70	He died in the waters.
6.1.1.71	Of those waters, whatever was pure, fit for sacrifice, and divine, that went away from the waters.
6.1.1.72	They became darbha grass.
6.1.1.73	When one purifies with darbha grass and darbha grass tufts, it is those waters which are pure, fit for the sacrifice, and divine which purify him.
6.1.1.74	He purifies with two (verses).
6.1.1.75	He purifies him with day and night.
6.1.1.76	He purifie with three (verses).
6.1.1.77	These are the three worlds.
6.1.1.78	He putifies him with these worlds.
6.1.1.79	He purities with five (verses).
6.1.1.80	The Pankti has five syllables.
6.1.1.81	The sacrifice is fivefold.
6.1.1.82	He puifies him for the sacrifice.
6.1.1.83	He pufies with six (verses).
6.1.1.84	There are six seasons.
6.1.1.85	He purifies him with the seasons.
6.1.1.86	He (the Adhvaryu) purifies him by seven (verses).
6.1.1.87	There are seven metres.
6.1.1.88	He putifies him by the metres.
6.1.1.89	He (Adhvaryu) purities him by nine (verses).
6.1.1.90	In a man there are nine breaths.
6.1.1.91	He putifies him with the breaths.
6.1.1.92	He (advaryu) putifies him by twenty-one (verses).
6.1.1.93	The fingers of the hand are ten.
6.1.1.94-102	Ten verses. The twenty-first chapter on the Self. He purifies him as much as the person is. He says, "May Citpati purify you." Citpati is indeed the mind. He putifies him by means of the mind. "May Vakpati purify you," he says. He putifies him by means of speech. "May the god Savitar purify you," he says.
6.1.1.103	He purifies him with the Savitrī verse.
6.1.1.104	He says, "O lord of purification, with the purifying (verse) I purify him for whom I am purifying."
6.1.1.105	He thus prays for a blessing.
6.1.2.1	Those who knew this, they became the gods.
6.1.2.2	He who knowing this purifies himself for the sacrifice, becomes (a god).
6.1.2.3	Having purified outside, he introduces inside.
6.1.2.4	Having purified him in the human world, he sends him to the pure divine world.
6.1.2.5	They say that one should offer with one oblation to the uninitiated.
6.1.2.6	One offers four oblations with the ladle for initiation.
6.1.2.7	One offers the fifth with the spoon.
6.1.2.8	The Pankti has five syllables.
6.1.2.9	The sacrifice is fivefold.
6.1.2.10	One attains the sacrifice.
6.1.2.11	He says, "To Akriti, to Agni, svāhā!"
6.1.2.12	For it is through Akriti that man directs himself towards the sacrifice, saying, "Let me sacrifice."
6.1.2.13	He says, "To Medha, to Manas, to Agni, Svāhā!"
6.1.2.14	It is through Medha and Manas that man approaches the sacrifice.
6.1.2.15	He says, "To Sarasvatī, to Pūṣan, to Agni, Svaha!"
6.1.2.16	Sarasvatī is speech.
6.1.2.17	Pūṣan is the earth.
6.1.2.18	He makes the sacrifice proceed with speech itself.
6.1.2.19	He says, "The divine waters, the great, the bestowers of all prosperity."
6.1.2.20	Those waters which are the rain-waters are the divine waters, the bestowers, the great, of all prosperity.
6.1.2.21	If he were to omit this formula, the heavenly waters would not be restrained and would come to this world.
6.1.2.22	He says "The divine waters are the great, the bestowers of all prosperity."
6.1.2.23	He pacifies them for this very world of his.
6.1.2.24	Therefore, having become peaceful, they come to this world.
6.1.2.25	He says, "Heaven and Earth."
6.1.2.26	For the sacrifice is in Heaven and Earth.
6.1.2.27	He says "The extensive firmament."
6.1.2.28	For the Sacrifice is in the firmament.
6.1.2.29	He says: "May Brihaspati grow with our oblation."
6.1.2.30-36	Brahma is the lord of the gods. He wins the sacrifice for him by means of Brahma. If he were to say, "For the arrangement," he would reach the sacrificial post. He says, "For growth." He encircles the sacrificial post. The sacrifice was created by Prajapati. It was created from him and went away.
6.1.2.37-42	He (the Hotri) took up the Yajus from the fallen (Yajus). He took up the Sama. He took up (the text of) the Rk. That is why the Udgrahana is called Udgrahana. One offers with a Rk for the raising of the sacrifice. They say that the Anushtubh metre was taken up. Therefore one offers with an Anushtubh for the raising of sacrifice.
6.1.2.43	They say that he takes up twelve Vatsa-bonds.
6.1.2.44	Therefore, those who know the twelve Vatsa bonds initiate.
6.1.2.45	That is indeed the Anushtubh metre.
6.1.2.46	Speech is Anushtubh.
6.1.2.47	When he initiates with this verse,
6.1.2.48	he initiates him with all speech.
6.1.2.49	He says, "All the gods are the leaders."
6.1.2.50	This is Savitri.
6.1.2.51-58	"Let man choose friendship with you," he says. This is for the Pitrs and the gods. "You are eager for the wealth of all," he says. This is for all the gods. "Choose prosperity, you are growing," he says.This is for Pusan. This is the Rk for all the gods.
6.1.2.59	The first foot has seven syllables.
6.1.2.60	The three feet have eight syllables each.
6.1.2.61	The three that have eight syllables, they make eight.
6.1.2.62	The four that have eight syllables make eight.
6.1.2.63	What has eight syllables, that is the Gāyatrī.
6.1.2.64	What has eleven syllables, that is Triṣṭubh.
6.1.2.65	What has twelve syllables, that is Jagatī.
6.1.2.66	That indeed is the Rk, all the metres.
6.1.2.67	When he consecrates with this verse, he consecrates him with all the metres.
6.1.2.68	The first foot has seven syllables.
6.1.2.69	The Sakvari metre has seven feet.
6.1.2.70	The Sakvarī metre is cattle.
6.1.2.71	He indeed wins cattle.
6.1.2.72	The first step is not completed from one syllable.
6.1.2.73	Therefore, from what is not completed in speech, men live.
6.1.2.74	He offers with the full (cup).
6.1.2.75	For Prajapati is like the full (cup); for the attainment of Prajapati.
6.1.2.76	He offers with the deficient (cup).
6.1.2.77	From the deficient (cup) Prajapati created offspring; for the creation of offspring.
6.1.3.1	When the Rk and the Sama were standing for the sacrifice to the gods, they assumed a dark form and stood aside.
6.1.3.2	They thought: "He who will return to this will be this."
6.1.3.3	They invited him.
6.1.3.4	They turned back to the gods, having set aside the greatness of day and night.
6.1.3.5	This is the color of the verses, that which is white on the black antelope skin.
6.1.3.6	This is of the Saman, that which is black.
6.1.3.7	He says, "They are established in the art of the Rk and Saman."
6.1.3.8	He indeed obtains the Rk and the Saman.
6.1.3.9	This is indeed the color of the day, that which is the white on the black-antelope skin.
6.1.3.10	This is the night of Krishna.
6.1.3.11	Whatever is deposited in it, that he obtains.
6.1.3.12	He consecrates with a black antelope skin.
6.1.3.13	The black antelope skin is indeed the form of Brahman.
6.1.3.14	He consecrate him with Brahman itself.
6.1.3.15	He says, "O god, I am learning this knowledge."
6.1.3.16	This is as per the prescribed procedure.
6.1.3.17	The consecrated one is indeed the embryo.
6.1.3.18	The womb is the garment.
6.1.3.19	One puts on.
6.1.3.20	Therefore, the embryos are born covered.
6.1.3.21	One should not put on before the purchase of Soma.
6.1.3.22	If one puts on before the purchase, the embryos of the offspring would be prone to fall.
6.1.3.23	One puts it on after the purchase of Soma,
6.1.3.24	then it is born.
6.1.3.25	And as one would give to a more worthy person, so is it.
6.1.3.26	The Angirasas, going to the world of heaven, divided the food.
6.1.3.27	What remained over from that became the arrows.
6.1.3.28	The arrows are food.
6.1.3.29	When the girdle is made of arrow-grass, he wins food.
6.1.3.30	He binds it in the middle.
6.1.3.31	He places food in the middle of him.
6.1.3.32	Therefore, they eat from the middle.
6.1.3.33	Above the navel of a man is pure, below it is impure.
6.1.3.34	When one ties (the rope) from the middle, he separates the pure from the impure.
6.1.3.35	Indra struck Vritra with the thunderbolt.
6.1.3.36	It became three-fold: the wooden post was one-third, the chariot was one-third and the sacrificial post was one- third.
6.1.3.37	Those arrows which did not break, they became arrows.
6.1.3.38	That is the arrow-ness of arrows.
6.1.3.39	The arrows are indeed the thunderbolt.
6.1.3.40	Hunger is indeed the enemy of man.
6.1.3.41	When the girdle is made of arrows, it directly strikes down hunger, the enemy, in the middle with the thunderbolt.
6.1.3.42	It is three-layered.
6.1.3.43	The breath is indeed three-layered.
6.1.3.44	He places the sacrificer in the middle of the three-fold breath.
6.1.3.45	The earth becomes the ropes for the purpose of spreading.
6.1.3.46	He consecrates the sacrificer with the girdle, the wife with the yoke, for the purpose of union.
6.1.3.47	The sacrifice thought of the Dakshina.
6.1.3.48	It became that.
6.1.3.49	Indra knew that.
6.1.3.50-57	He thought, "Whoever is born from this will be this." He entered her. Indra was born from her. He thought, "Whoever will be born after me will be this." He cut off the womb of her. She became a woman in labour. That was the birth of the woman in labour. He put her in his hand.
6.1.3.58	He places it among the animals.
6.1.3.59	It becomes a black-horned one.
6.1.3.60	You are the womb of Indra.
6.1.3.61	Do not harm me."
6.1.3.62	He gives the black-horned (animal).
6.1.3.63	He makes the sacrifice with its own womb, the Dakṣiṇā with its own womb. The Indra with its own womb for the sake of having its own womb.
6.1.3.64	"For your agriculture with good crops," he says.
6.1.3.65	Therefore, the plants grow without being cultivated.
6.1.3.66	He says, "From the plants that are very fragrant."
6.1.3.67	Therefore, the plants bear fruit.
6.1.3.68	If one scratches with the hand, the people would be naked.
6.1.3.69	If one smiles, the people would become naked.
6.1.3.70	One scratches with a black horn.
6.1.3.71	Having taken it, he smiles for the protection of the people.
6.1.3.72	One should not have used the black-tipped stakes before the Dakṣiṇā offerings.
6.1.3.73	If one had used the black-pointed stakes before the Daksiṇā offerings, the womb of the people would have fallen down.
6.1.3.74	Having taken the Dakṣiṇa offerings, one places the black-pointed stake in the Cātvāla.
6.1.3.75	The sacrificial post is the womb of the sacrifice.
6.1.3.76	The black-horned one is the womb.
6.1.3.77	He places the womb in the womb for the sake of the womb of the sacrificial post.
6.1.4.1	Speech indeed departed from the gods when they were standing for the sacrifice.
6.1.4.2	It entered the trees.
6.1.4.3	That speech which is spoken in the trees, in the drum, in the lute, in the lyre,
6.1.4.4	When he gives the staff to the one who has been initiated, he seizes speech.
6.1.4.5	It is made of Udumbara wood.
6.1.4.6	Udumbara is energy.
6.1.4.7	He seizes energy.
6.1.4.8	It is the size of the face.
6.1.4.9	He places energy in the face.
6.1.4.10	Therefore, they eat energy from the face.
6.1.4.11	When Soma has been bought, he gives the staff (to the Maitrāvaruṇa).
6.1.4.12	Maitrāvaruṇa first divides the speech among the priests.
6.1.4.13	The priests establish the sacrificer in it.
6.1.4.14	He says, "Svāhā to the sacrifice in the mind."
6.1.4.15	For it is with the mind that a person approaches the sacrifice.
6.1.4.16	He says "Svāhā, to the two, heaven and earth."
6.1.4.17	For the sacrifice is in heaven and earth.
6.1.4.18	"He says, 'To the wind from the sky.'
6.1.4.19	For the sacrifice is in the sky.
6.1.4.20	He says, 'The wind from the sacrifice.'
6.1.4.21	This indeed is the sacrifice that blows.
6.1.4.22	He directly invokes it.
6.1.4.23	He makes a fist.
6.1.4.24	He restrains speech for the stability of the sacrifice.
6.1.4.25	He says three times in a low voice, 'This Brahman has not been initiated.'
6.1.4.26	He announces him to the gods alone.
6.1.4.27	Three times loudly.
6.1.4.28	He announces him to both the gods and men.
6.1.4.29	One should not release speech before the stars.
6.1.4.30	If one releases speech before the stars, one would cut off the sacrifice.
6.1.4.31	When the stars have risen, one undertakes the vow, saying, "I undertake the vow."
6.1.4.32	He releases speech.
6.1.4.33	Yajnavrata is indeed consecrated.
6.1.4.34	He releases speech towards the sacrifice.
6.1.4.35	If he releases, he should recite the Vaishnavi verse.
6.1.4.36	Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
6.1.4.37	He sustains the sacrifice with the sacrifice itself.
6.1.4.38	He says, "I have conceived the divine mind."
6.1.4.39	He softens the sacrifice with that.
6.1.4.40	He says "May the good ones be our protectors."
6.1.4.41	He indeed wins prosperity.
6.1.4.42	Brahmin scholars say:
6.1.4.43	"One should offer a sacrifice in the house of one who has been consecrated; one should not offer a sacrifice."
6.1.4.44	One who has been consecrated is indeed an oblation.
6.1.4.45	If one were to offer, one would offer after taking away from the sacrificer.
6.1.4.46	If one does not offer, one would obstruct the sacrifice.
6.1.4.47	He says, "Those gods who are born of mind, who are yoked with mind."
6.1.4.48	The gods are indeed the vital airs.
6.1.4.49	The mind-born, the mind-joined.
6.1.4.50	He offers to them only indirectly.
6.1.4.51	It is neither offered nor not offered.
6.1.4.52	The initiated one who is sleeping, the demons seek to injure.
6.1.4.53	For Agni indeed is the destroyer of demons.
6.1.4.54	He says, "O Agni, do thou guard well; we shall sleep well."
6.1.4.55	Having made Agni the lord, he sleeps.
6.1.4.56	For the destruction of demons.
6.1.4.57	He who is consecrated sleeps as if he were not observing the vow.
6.1.4.58	He says, "You are the guardian of vows, O Agni."
6.1.4.59	Agni is the guardian of vows of the gods.
6.1.4.60	He himself makes him observe the vow.
6.1.4.61	"The god has come to mortals," he says.
6.1.4.62	For he is a god among mortals.
6.1.4.63	"You are to be worshipped at sacrifices," he says.
6.1.4.64	For this is what is praised in sacrifices.
6.1.4.65	When one is initiated, the senses and the deities depart from him while he is sleeping.
6.1.4.66	He says, "All the gods have surrounded me."
6.1.4.67	He unites him with the senses and the gods.
6.1.4.68	If he does not recite this mantra, then the number of animals he would have initiated would be the number of animals that would belong to him.
6.1.4.69	"May Soma sing more and more in the offering," he says.
6.1.4.70	He indeed wins unlimited cattle.
6.1.4.71	"You are the moon, may you be for my enjoyment," he says. He indeed wins unlimited cattle
6.1.4.72	He indeed wins cattle according to the deity.
6.1.4.73	"For Vayu thee, for Varuna thee,"
6.1.4.74	If he does not direct them thus, the Dakṣiṇā would go to the wrong deities.
6.1.4.75	If he directs them thus, the Daksina goes to the right deities.
6.1.4.76	It does not go to the wrong gods.
6.1.4.77	He says, "The divine waters, the feet of the waters."
6.1.4.78	Whatever is sacred, whatever is fit for sacrifice, that I have not transgressed. He says this indeed.
6.1.4.79	He says, "I have followed the unbroken thread of the earth."
6.1.4.80	Having made a bridge, he goes beyond.
6.1.5.1	The gods, having decided on the divine sacrifice, did not know the directions.
6.1.5.2	They ran towards each other.
6.1.5.3	"By you, by you, the creatures!" They entrusted themselves to Aditi.
6.1.5.4	You are the one who is the protector of the creatures."
6.1.5.5	She said, "Choose a boon."
6.1.5.6	"Your sacrifices are dedicated to me, and they arise from me."
6.1.5.7	Therefore, the sun is the one dedicated to the beginning of sacrifices, and the sun is the rising one.
6.1.5.8	One offers to five deities because there are five directions, for the knowledge of the directions.
6.1.5.9	And also because the Panchati (five-syllabled) verse is five syllables.
6.1.5.10	The sacrifice is fivefold.
6.1.5.11	He indeed wins the sacrifice.
6.1.5.12	They performed the sacrifice of Pathya and Svāsthya.
6.1.5.13	They knew the eastern direction by Agni, the southern by Daksha, the western by Soma, the northern by Savitar, the upward by Aditya.
6.1.5.14	One performs the sacrifice of Pathyā and Svāsthīya.
6.1.5.15	One indeed knows the eastern direction by it.
6.1.5.16	Having worshipped the auspicious Pathya, he offers to Agni-Soma.
6.1.5.17	Agni-Soma are the eyes of the sacrifice.
6.1.5.18	One sees through them.
6.1.5.19	Having offered to Agni-Soma, he offers to Savitar.
6.1.5.20	One sees with the impulse of Savitar.
6.1.5.21	Having offered Savitar, he offers to Aditi.
6.1.5.22	Aditi is this (earth).
6.1.5.23	In this very sacrifice he sees the establishment.
6.1.5.24	Having performed the Aditi sacrifice, one recites the Marutī verse for the establishment of the people.
6.1.5.25	The Brahmaṇas say:
6.1.5.26	The Prāyaṇīya should be performed without Anūyājā, like the Prāyaṇa, and the Udayanīya should be without Prāyaṇa, like the Anūyājās.
6.1.5.27	These are the Prāyaṇas.
6.1.5.28	These are Anūyājãs.
6.1.5.29	That itself is the continuity of the sacrifice.
6.1.5.30	That should not be done.
6.1.5.31	The Prajās are the self.
6.1.5.32	The Anuyajās are the offspring.
6.1.5.33	If one were to omit the Prajās, one would omit the self.
6.1.5.34	If one omits the Anuyajā, one would omit offspring.
6.1.5.35	Whatever is not done in a well-spread out sacrifice, the sacrifice is defeated.
6.1.5.36	The sacrificer is defeated when the sacrifice is defeated.
6.1.5.37	The Pravargya rite is to be performed like the Prayāja and Anūyāja rites.
6.1.5.38	The Udayaniya rite is to be done like the Prayāja rite and Anūyaja rite.
6.1.5.39	It does not obstruct one's own self, nor does it obstruct one's progeny.
6.1.5.40	The sacrifice does not fail, nor does the sacrificer.
6.1.5.41	One offers the Udayaniya rite after the Pravargya rite.
6.1.5.42	That itself is the continuity of the sacrifice.
6.1.5.43	If one were to perform the Yagya of the Pravargya rite as the Yagya of Udayaniya rite, one would ascend the other world and become a transgressor.
6.1.5.44	One performs the Yagya of Pravargya rite with the Puronuvakya of Udayaniya rite.
6.1.5.45	One stands firm in this world.
6.1.6.1	Kadru and Suparni competed for their own forms.
6.1.6.2-10	She won the Suparna. She said: "The Soma is in the third heaven; bring it. With that redeem yourself." This is indeed Kadru. That is Suparna. The metres are connected with Suparna. She said: "Your parents have given you sons.
6.1.6.11	In the third heaven, Soma is there; bring him here.
6.1.6.12	With that, you should redeem yourself."
6.1.6.13	"This is what Kadru said."
6.1.6.14	The Jagati verse fell down with fourteen syllables.
6.1.6.15	Having reached it, it returned.
6.1.6.16	Two syllables were missing from it.
6.1.6.17	It came back with animals and consecration.
6.1.6.18	Therefore, the Jagati is the most animal-friendly of the meters.
6.1.6.19	Therefore, one initiates one who has cattle.
6.1.6.20	The Tristubh metre fell down, having thirteen syllables.
6.1.6.21	Having reached it, it turned back.
6.1.6.22	Two syllables were missing from it.
6.1.6.23	It came by means of Dakshina and Tapas.
6.1.6.24	Therefore, in the Madhyandine Savana, Dakshina is given to the Tristubh metre.
6.1.6.25	This indeed is Tapas, they say, he who gives himself.
6.1.6.26	The Gayatri fell down with four syllables, with truth, with victory, with light.
6.1.6.27	She found him, the goat.
6.1.6.28	That is the goat-ness of the goat.
6.1.6.29	She brought Soma and four syllables.
6.1.6.30	She became eight-syllabled.
6.1.6.31	The Brahmanas say: Why did Gayatri, the smallest of the metres, enter the mouth of the sacrifice?
6.1.6.32	Because he brought Soma from that place, he entered the mouth of the sacrifi
6.1.6.33	Therefore, it is the most brilliant.
6.1.6.34	He took two Savanas with his feet and one with his mouth.
6.1.6.35	What he took with his mouth, he studied.
6.1.6.36	Therefore the two Savanas are rich in Soma, the morning and the midday Savanas.
6.1.6.37	Therefore they sprinkle the third Savana with the Rijiṣa.
6.1.6.38	They think it is drunk.
6.1.6.39	He pours down the Aśira for the sake of being rich in Soma.
6.1.6.40	And he also collects it.
6.1.6.41	When that Soma was being brought, the Gandharva Visvavasu surrounded it.
6.1.6.42	He stayed for three nights, hidden.
6.1.6.43	Therefore Soma stays for three nights, bought.
6.1.6.44	The gods said, "Gandharvas are desirous of women. Let us buy her with a woman."
6.1.6.45	Having made speech into a woman, they bought her with her.
6.1.6.46	She, having become the color of a red cow, went away from the Gandharvas and stood.
6.1.6.47	That is the birth of Rohitas.
6.1.6.48	Those gods said:
6.1.6.49	"You have gone away from us."
6.1.6.50	"He does not return to us."
6.1.6.51	"We are distressed."
6.1.6.52	Brahma and Gandharvas sang, the gods sang.
6.1.6.53	She returned to the singing gods.
6.1.6.54	Therefore women desire one who sings.
6.1.6.55	Women desire him who knows this.
6.1.6.56	And he who, knowing this, is born among the people, they give to him, and if they are many.
6.1.6.57	He buys with a one-year-old (animal).
6.1.6.58	He buys it with all speech.
6.1.6.59	Therefore men speak with speech.
6.1.6.60	He buys it for a hornless, one-eared, one-eyed, one-hoofed, seven-hooved (animal).
6.1.6.61	With all (speech) he buys it.
6.1.6.62	If one were to buy with a white (cow), the sacrificer would be of bad skin.
6.1.6.63	If one were to buy a covering with a black (cow), the life of the sacrificer would become short.
6.1.6.64	If one buys a cow with two colours, one would be defeated by another.
6.1.6.65	One buys with a reddish-brown cow with tawny eyes.
6.1.6.66	This is indeed the form of Soma.
6.1.6.67	One buys it with its own deity.
6.1.7.1	That became gold.
6.1.7.2	Therefore they purify gold from water.
6.1.7.3	Brahmin scholars say, "Why are beings born from truth without bones and become bone-less?"
6.1.7.4	Because one offers gold mixed with ghee, therefore beings are born without bones and become without bones.
6.1.7.5	This is indeed the dear abode of Agni, namely ghee.
6.1.7.6	Gold is brilliance.
6.1.7.7	"He says, "This is your bright body, this is your lustre."
6.1.7.8	He makes him brilliant and with good body.
6.1.7.9	And he indeed gathers him.
6.1.7.10	If one were to place it without binding, the embryos of the offspring would fall down.
6.1.7.11	He places it bound, for the stability of the embryos.
6.1.7.12	He binds the sacrificial grass, for the begetting of offspring.
6.1.7.13	The Soma-purchasing cow is indeed speech.
6.1.7.14	He says, "Thou art a swift one."
6.1.7.15	What one hurries with the mind, that one speaks with the voice.
6.1.7.16	He says "Held by the mind."
6.1.7.17	For the mind holds the voice.
6.1.7.18	"Beloved by Vishnu," he says.
6.1.7.19	Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
6.1.7.20	He makes her agreeable to the sacrifice.
6.1.7.21	He says, "May your offspring be true to the Savana."
6.1.7.22	He obtains speech blessed by Savitar.
6.1.7.23	When the parts are being made, the Rakshas attack the sacrifice.
6.1.7.24	This indeed is the path of the one who is not attacked by Rakshas, which is between Agni and Surya.
6.1.7.25	The eye of the sun is the eye of Agni, the eye of Agni is the eye of the sun.
6.1.7.26	He mounts the path that has been struck by the Rakshas.
6.1.7.27	This is indeed speech, the Soma-purchasing cow.
6.1.7.28	You are the mind.
6.1.7.29	He says, "You are the mind."
6.1.7.30	He instructs her thus.
6.1.7.31	Therefore offspring are born as the instructed ones.
6.1.7.32	He says "You are the Mind."
6.1.7.33	Whatever one thinks with the mind, one speaks with the speech.
6.1.7.34	He says, "You are the mind."
6.1.7.35	Whatever one approaches with the mind, that one does.
6.1.7.36	He says "You are the intellect."
6.1.7.37	Whatever one contemplates with the mind, it is spoken with the speech. 
6.1.7.38	He says, “You are the Dakṣiṇā.”
6.1.7.39	For this is the Dakṣiṇa.
6.1.7.40	He says “You are the Yajña.”
6.1.7.41	He makes her indeed the Yajña.
6.1.7.42	He says "You are the Kṣatriya."
6.1.7.43	This is the Ksatriya (class).
6.1.7.44	He says, "Aditi is the one with two heads."
6.1.7.45	The sun is the one at the beginning of sacrifices, and the sun is the one rising.
6.1.7.46	Therefore he says this.
6.1.7.47	If it were untied, it would be crooked.
6.1.7.48	If it is tied to the foot and spread, the sacrificer would be short-lived.
6.1.7.49	If the thunderbolt-striking (weapon) is taken up by the ear, one would conquer another, and another would conquer him.
6.1.7.50	He says, "May Mitra bind you in the foot."
6.1.7.51	Mitra is the auspicious one among the gods.
6.1.7.52	He binds it in the foot with that very (weapon).
6.1.7.53	He says, “May Pūṣan protect the path.”
6.1.7.54	This very one is Pūṣan.
6.1.7.55	He makes her the overlord of this (Soma).
6.1.7.56	He says, 'To Indra, the overlord.'
6.1.7.57	He makes Indra the overlord of her.
6.1.7.58	'May your mother and father approve of you.' He says.
6.1.7.59	'May the father approve of you,' he says.
6.1.7.60	He buys her with the approval of her.
6.1.7.61	He says, '(O Goddess) go to the god.'
6.1.7.62	She is indeed a goddess, and Soma is a god.
6.1.7.63	He says 'To Indra, Soma.'
6.1.7.64	Soma is indeed offered to Indra.
6.1.7.65	If one does not recite this mantra, then the Soma-purchasing cow would be lost.
6.1.7.66	He says, "May Rudra lead you."
6.1.7.67	Rudra is indeed the fierce one among the gods.
6.1.7.68	He places him beyond her, for turning back.
6.1.7.69	One does indeed perform a fierce act when one proclaims Rudra.
6.1.7.70	He says, "On the path of the friend," for peace.
6.1.7.71	He who buys Soma with the Soma-buying formula, sells it with speech.
6.1.7.72	He says, "May you return safely with the Soma, with wealth."
6.1.7.73	Having sold with speech, he again takes speech into himself.
6.1.7.74	His speech does not fail him, he who knows thus.
6.1.8.1	He moves forward six steps.
6.1.8.2	Speech does not exceed six days.
6.1.8.3	He thus wins as much as is the extent of speech.
6.1.8.4	He offers on the seventh step.
6.1.8.5	The Sakvari metre has seven steps.
6.1.8.6	The Sakvarī metre is cattle.
6.1.8.7	He thus wins cattle.
6.1.8.8	There are seven domestic animals,
6.1.8.9	seven wild animals,
6.1.8.10	seven metres.
6.1.8.11	For the winning of both.
6.1.8.12	"Thou art Vasu."
6.1.8.13	"Thou art Rudra."
6.1.8.14	He says.
6.1.8.15	This is the greatness of her form.
6.1.8.16	"He says, "May Brihaspati grant you a pleasant and agreeable (boon)."
6.1.8.17	He says,
6.1.8.18	"Brihaspati is indeed the Brahman of the gods."
6.1.8.19	He wins cattle for him through Brahman.
6.1.8.20	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, "May Rudra with the Vasus grant you."
6.1.8.21	He says, "May it be so."
6.1.8.22	For turning back.
6.1.8.23	I anoint thee on the head of the earth, for the worship of the gods."
6.1.8.24	He says:
6.1.8.25	"For the worship of the Gods is indeed the head of the Earth."
6.1.8.26	"On the place of Ida."
6.1.8.27	He says.
6.1.8.28	"For the place of Ida is indeed the Soma-purchasing (cow)."
6.1.8.29	"O ghee-possessing Svāhā!"
6.1.8.30	He says. 
6.1.8.31	Whatever ghee was pressed from her place,
6.1.8.32	Therefore he says this.
6.1.8.33	If the Adhvaryu were to offer a libation in a fireless (place), the Adhvaryus would be blind, and the Rakshas would destroy the sacrifice.
6.1.8.34	Having placed gold, he offers.
6.1.8.35	He offers in a fire with Agni.
6.1.8.36	The Adhvaryu is not blind.
6.1.8.37	The Rakshas do not destroy the sacrifice.
6.1.8.38	When each section of the sacrifice is performed, the demons seek to injure it.
6.1.8.39	The Rakshas is written around.
6.1.8.40	The enemies are written around.
6.1.8.41	He says:
6.1.8.42	For the destruction of the Rakshas.
6.1.8.43	"Here I cut off the neck of the Rakshasa who hates us and whom we hate."
6.1.8.44	He says:
6.1.8.45-52	There are indeed two persons, the one who hates and the one who is hated. He cuts off the neck of the one who hates him and the one who hates. The Soma-purchasing cow is the place of the animals. As long as the Soma is pressed, he indeed wins the animals. He presses, saying, "May the wealth be ours." The Adhvaryu does not go in between himself and the animals.
6.1.8.53	"Thou art the giver of wealth."
6.1.8.54	He gives it to the sacrificer.
6.1.8.55	The sacrificer himself bestows wealth.
6.1.8.56	"Thou art the giver."
6.1.8.57	To the wife.
6.1.8.58	The wife is half of one's self.
6.1.8.59	As one puts it in the house, so it is.
6.1.8.60	"May Tvashtri help thee."
6.1.8.61	He says.
6.1.8.62	Tvashtri is the creator of the forms of animals and pairs.
6.1.8.63-69	He places the form of the animal itself. The Garhapatya is placed for this world. The Ahavaniya for the other world. If one were to place it in the Garhapatya, one would have animals in this world. If in the Ahavaniya, one would be having animals in the other world. He places it in both. He makes him having animals in both worlds.
6.1.9.1	The Brahmanas say, "Soma is not to be mixed with the Soma-juice."
6.1.9.2	Soma is indeed the king of plants.
6.1.9.3	What is lost in it is indeed swallowed by it.
6.1.9.4	If one mixes it, it is as if one were to throw out what has been swallowed.
6.1.9.5	If he does not know how to examine it, then it is as if the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer are greedy.
6.1.9.6	He should say, "Examine the Soma for sale."
6.1.9.7	If he gives both to the other, then the Soma-seller is greedy.
6.1.9.8	Therefore the Soma-seller should be greedy.
6.1.9.9	Aruṇa Aupaveśya said, "I shall obtain the third pressing at the Soma-purchase."
6.1.9.10	He measures the skin of animals.
6.1.9.11	He indeed obtains animals.
6.1.9.12	For animals are the third pressing.
6.1.9.13	If one desires, "Let him be without animals," he should measure for him according to the Rk.
6.1.9.14	The Rk is without animals.
6.1.9.15	He becomes without animals.
6.1.9.16	He for whom one desires, 'May he be possessed of cattle', should measure it from the hair.
6.1.9.17	This indeed is the form of cattle.
6.1.9.18	By means of the form he wins cattle for him.
6.1.9.19	He indeed becomes possessed of cattle.
6.1.9.20	He buys it at the end of the waters.
6.1.9.21	He buys him as a living being.
6.1.9.22	He says, 'You are without a master.'
6.1.9.23	He makes him without a master.
6.1.9.24-31	The planet Shukra is yours. For Shukra is his planet. He goes to the Anasa. He goes for the greatness of it. He goes towards the Anasa. Therefore, the life is in the Anasa. That which is taken away by the head, that is the life in the mountain. Where indeed they take him with the head,
6.1.9.32-37	He recites the Ati-chanda verse, "I invoke that god Savitar." The Ati-chanda is all the metres. He thus recites him with all the metres. The Ati-chanda metre is the armour of all the metres. When he recites the Ati chanda verse, he makes him the armour of all his equals. He recites the verse with one and one omission.
6.1.9.38	He measures it with the unmeasured and the measured.
6.1.9.39	Therefore the fingers have different powers.
6.1.9.40	He holds the thumb on all (fingers).
6.1.9.41	Therefore the thumb has equal power with the other fingers.
6.1.9.42	Therefore it moves with all.
6.1.9.43	If he were to measure it with all together, the fingers would be joined.
6.1.9.44	He measures with one (verse) each.
6.1.9.45	Therefore they are born divided.
6.1.9.46	He measures five times with the Yajus.
6.1.9.47	The Pankti has five syllables.
6.1.9.48	The sacrifice is fivefold.
6.1.9.49	He indeed wins the sacrifice.
6.1.9.50	Five times silently.
6.1.9.51	They become ten.
6.1.9.52	The Viraj has ten syllables.
6.1.9.53	Food is Viraj.
6.1.9.54	He wins the food of Viraj.
6.1.9.55	If he measures with a formula, he wins the present.
6.1.9.56	If silently, the future.
6.1.9.57	If the Soma were to be just as much as he measures, it would belong to the sacrificer alone and not to the assistants.
6.1.9.58	He says, "For the offspring of you." He gathers it together.
6.1.9.59	He shares it with the assistants.
6.1.9.60	One puts on the garment.
6.1.9.61-68	The garment is dedicated to all the deities. He thus makes him prosper with all the deities. The Soma is indeed the cattle. He ties on the upper garment with the formula, "For your breath." He thus places the breath in the cattle. With the formula, "for your Vyana" he ties on the lower garment. He thus places Vyana in the cattle. Therefore the breath does not leave one who is asleep.
6.1.10.1	If he says, "I buy with a calf," or "I buy with an animal," the Soma should be bought at the price of a cow, the sacrificer at the price of an animal, and the Adhvaryu at the price of the animal.
6.1.10.2	One should not exceed the value of a cow.
6.1.10.3	One should say, "I buy for the price of a calf."
6.1.10.4	He makes the Soma at the price of cows, the sacrificer and the Adhvaryu at the price of animals.
6.1.10.5	He does not exceed the greatness of the cow.
6.1.10.6	He buys with a heifer.
6.1.10.7	He buys him with great austerities.
6.1.10.8	He buys (the animal) with gold.
6.1.10.9	He buys it with semen.
6.1.10.10	He buys by a cow.
6.1.10.11	He purchases it with milk.
6.1.10.12	He buys a bull.
6.1.10.13	He buys Indra himself.
6.1.10.14	He buys an ox.
6.1.10.15	Fire is the bull.
6.1.10.16	He buys the sacrifice with fire itself.
6.1.10.17	He buys with a pair, for the securing of a pair.
6.1.10.18	He buys (it) with a garment.
6.1.10.19	The garment is dedicated to all the gods.
6.1.10.20	He buys it for all the deities.
6.1.10.21	Ten are completed.
6.1.10.22	The Viraj has ten syllables.
6.1.10.23	The Viraja is food.
6.1.10.24	He wins the food of Viraj.
6.1.10.25	He says, "You are the body of Tapas, the colour of Prajapati."
6.1.10.26	The Adhvaryu hides it for the animals, for himself, for not being deprived.
6.1.10.27	He goes to prosperity, he obtains cattle, he who knows thus.
6.1.10.28	He says "I buy your bright (Soma) with bright (Soma)."
6.1.10.29	It is as per the prescribed procedure.
6.1.10.30	The gods, having bought Soma with gold, took it back again.
6.1.10.31	For who would sell his own brilliance?
6.1.10.32	One should take back the gold with which one has bought Soma.
6.1.10.33	One puts brilliance into oneself.
6.1.10.34	"One says, 'The light is in the Soma-seller, the darkness is in me.'
6.1.10.35	One puts light into the sacrificer.
6.1.10.36	He gives the Soma-seller to Tamas.
6.1.10.37	If one were to kill without binding, the snakes would be equal to the venomous ones.
6.1.10.38	He says, "I bind the necks of the snakes, the venomous ones."
6.1.10.39	The snakes become equal to the non-venomous ones.
6.1.10.40	He strikes the Soma-seller with Tamas.
6.1.10.41	He says "Your own radiance."
6.1.10.42-46	These (gods) protected the Soma in that world. They brought Soma to them. If he does not give the Soma-purchasing gifts to them, then his Soma would be unpurchased, and they would not protect his Soma in that world.
6.1.10.47	These (priests) protect the Soma in this world.
6.1.11.1	The Soma bought by Varuna is deposited.
6.1.11.2	He says, "O Mitra, come, you who are the giver of good friendship," for peace.
6.1.11.3	He says (to the sacrificer), "Enter Indra's right thigh."
6.1.11.4	The gods, having bought the Soma, deposited it on Indra's right side.
6.1.11.5	He who sacrifices is indeed Indra.
6.1.11.6	Therefore he says thus.
6.1.11.7	He says, "With life, with my life."
6.1.11.8	He rises up following the deity.
6.1.11.9	He says "Follow the earth and the sky."
6.1.11.10	For now Soma is connected with the deity of the sky.
6.1.11.11	You are the seat of Aditi.
6.1.11.12	He says this, "Sit on the seat of Adity."
6.1.11.13	This is in accordance with the prescribed ritual.
6.1.11.14-20	He indeed injures him when he makes him who is Varuna-connected to be Mitra-connected. He lays him down with a Varuna-verse. He indeed makes him whole with his own deity. He binds him with a garment. The garment is connected with all deities. He indeed renders him whole with all deities. And also for the removal of Rakshas.
6.1.11.21	He says, "He spread the sky over the forests."
6.1.11.22	For he spread the sky over forests.
6.1.11.23	He says, "The strength in the horses."
6.1.11.24	For the strength is in the horses.
6.1.11.25	He says "The milk in the cows."
6.1.11.26	For the milk is in the cows.
6.1.11.27	He says,"The resolve in the hearts."
6.1.11.28	For the resolve is in the hearts.
6.1.11.29	He says, "Varuna in the directions, Agni."
6.1.11.30	For Varuna is in the directions, and Agni.
6.1.11.31	He says, "The sun in heaven."
6.1.11.32	For the sun is in heaven.
6.1.11.33	He says "Soma in the mountains."
6.1.11.34	The mountains are the stones.
6.1.11.35	He who sacrifices places Soma in them.
6.1.11.36	Therefore he says thus.
6.1.11.37	"He puts on the black antelope skin with the verse addressed to Surya, "I invoke that Jātavedas..." for the removal of Rakshas.
6.1.11.38	He says, "This is the bull, the destroyer of foes."
6.1.11.39	It is as per the injunction.
6.1.11.40	He says "Move away, O lord of the earth."
6.1.11.41	For this is the lord of beings.
6.1.11.42	He says "All the worlds."
6.1.11.43	For he moves to all the worlds.
6.1.11.44	"He says, "May no one harm thee."
6.1.11.45	When the Soma was being brought in, the Gandharva Visvavasu surrounded it.
6.1.11.46	Therefore he says this, for protection.
6.1.11.47	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, "Thou art for the welfare of the sacrificer."
6.1.11.48	This is the beginning of the sacrifice for the sacrificer.
6.1.11.49	for the purpose of not being cut off.
6.1.11.50	Indeed, when Soma is bought and brought in, Varuna approaches the sacrificer.
6.1.11.51	He says, "Salutations to Mitra and Varuna, the seer," for the sake of peace.
6.1.11.52	They carry Soma.
6.1.11.53	He stands firm with Agni.
6.1.11.54	They approach the sacrificer as they come together.
6.1.11.55	Indeed, before the consecration, the one who is consecrated moves his self towards the goal.
6.1.11.56	When one offers the animal dedicated to Agni-Soma,
6.1.11.57	it is for the redemption of the self.
6.1.11.58	Therefore, it is not to be destroyed.
6.1.11.59	It is like the redemption of a man.
6.1.11.60	But some say, "Indra killed Vritra with Agni-Soma."
6.1.11.61	When one offers the animal to Agni-Soma
6.1.11.62	it is for killing Vritra.
6.1.11.63	Therefore, it should be said.
6.1.11.64	He attends to the Varuna-rite.
6.1.11.65	He attends him with his own deity.
6.2.1.1	If one were to accept hospitality after releasing both, one would sever the sacrifice.
6.2.1.2	If one does not release both, then it is done as it is done for an unexpected guest.
6.2.1.3	One is released, another is not released.
6.2.1.4	Then he accepts the hospitality for the continuity of the sacrifice.
6.2.1.5	The wife follows.
6.2.1.6	For the wife is the mistress of the sacrifice. The wife alone is the mistress of a sacrifice.
6.2.1.7	He offers with the wife's consent.
6.2.1.8	What the wife does for the sacrifice is a union.
6.2.1.9	Now, indeed, this is the beginning of the sacrifice for the wife, for non-separation.
6.2.1.10	As many attendants as the king goes with, hospitality is offered to all of them.
6.2.1.11	The metres indeed are the attendants of King Soma.
6.2.1.12	You are the hospitality of Agni.
6.2.1.13	He says, "For Vishnu thee."
6.2.1.14	He does it with the Gayatri metre.
6.2.1.15	You are the guest of Soma.
6.2.1.16	He says, "For Vishnu thee."
6.2.1.17	He does it with the Tristubh (metre).
6.2.1.18	You are the guest of the guest.
6.2.1.19	He says "For Vishnu thee".
6.2.1.20	He does it by the Jagati (metre).
6.2.1.21	For thee to Agni, the bestower of wealth and prosperity.
6.2.1.22	He says: "For Vishnu thee"
6.2.1.23	He does it in the Anushtubh (metre).
6.2.1.24	For thee, O hawk, for thee, O Soma-bearer.
6.2.1.25	He says, "For Vishnu thee."
6.2.1.26	He does this with the Gayatri.
6.2.1.27	He takes it five times.
6.2.1.28	The Pankti has five syllables.
6.2.1.29	The sacrifice is fivefold.
6.2.1.30	He indeed wins the sacrifice.
6.2.1.31	Brahmin scholars say, "Why is the Atithyas rite performed on both sides of the true Gayatri?"
6.2.1.32	Since Soma was brought in, therefore the Atithya is performed on both sides of the Gāyatrī, before and after.
6.2.1.33	The Atithya is indeed the head of the sacrifice.
6.2.1.34	The cake on nine potsherds is offered.
6.2.1.35	Therefore the head is spread out in nine parts.
6.2.1.36	The cake is on nine potsherads.
6.2.1.37	Those three, with three potsherds, are measured by the Trivrit Stoma.
6.2.1.38	The Trivrit is brilliance.
6.2.1.39	He places brilliance at the head of the sacrifice.
6.2.1.40	There is a cake on nine potsherds.
6.2.1.41	Those three, with three pots, are measured by breath.
6.2.1.42	Breath is Trivrit.
6.2.1.43	He places the Trivrit breath at the head of sacrifice.
6.2.1.44	The Aśvālā and the Aiksavī are the wings of Prajāpati.
6.2.1.45	The Aśvālā is the wing on the right side, the Aiksaví on the left.
6.2.1.46	He thus gathers together the eye of Prajāpati himself.
6.2.1.47	The gods offered oblations, the Asuras took them away.
6.2.1.48	The gods saw the Karṣmarya wood.
6.2.1.49	"He who is the performer of the sacrifice, may he perform the sacrifice with this (sacrifice)."
6.2.1.50	They made enclosing sticks of wood.
6.2.1.51	With them they destroyed the Rakshas.
6.2.1.52	When the enclosing sticks are of wood, it is for the destruction of the Rakshas;
6.2.1.53	(he touches them) for the non-pervasion of the Rakshasa.
6.2.1.54	He does not place them in front.
6.2.1.55	The sun indeed, rising in the east, removes the Rakshas.
6.2.1.56	He places the two kindling woods above.
6.2.1.57	He removes the Rakshasas above. One with a formula, the other silently, for the sake of union.
6.2.1.58	He places two.
6.2.1.59	The sacrificer has two feet. For stability.
6.2.1.60	Brahmanas say:
6.2.1.61	Agni and Soma are the two deities. Why is hospitality offered to Soma and not to Agni?
6.2.1.62	When one kindles Agni by rubbing the wood, it is then that hospitality is offered to Agni.
6.2.1.63	Some say: Agni is all the deities.
6.2.1.64	When one kindling Agni with the oblation approaches him, one generates all the deities for the oblation.
6.2.2.1	The gods and the demons were engaged in a battle.
6.2.2.2	The gods were hostile to each other.
6.2.2.3	They, standing for supremacy over each other, divided into five groups:
6.2.2.4	Agni with the Vasus,
6.2.2.5	Soma with the Rudras,
6.2.2.6	Indra with the Maruts,
6.2.2.7	Varuna with the Adityas,
6.2.2.8	Brihaspati with the Visve Devas.
6.2.2.9	They thought:
6.2.2.10-12	We are not at variance with our enemies, the Asuras. We are at variance with each other. May we be reconciled with those who are dear to us. May he be excluded from them who first harms us.
6.2.2.13	Therefore, he who first injures the Tanunaptras, he meets with calamity.
6.2.2.14	When one offers the Tanunaptra oblation, it is for the purpose of overpowering the enemies.
6.2.2.15	One becomes one's own self.
6.2.2.16	One's enemy becomes inferior.
6.2.2.17	One offers five times.
6.2.2.18	They offered it in five ways.
6.2.2.19	And the Pankti has five syllables.
6.2.2.20-30	The sacrifice is fivefold. He indeed wins the sacrifice. He says, "I take you for Apati." Apati is indeed the breath. He indeed pleases the breath. "For Parapati," he says. Parapati is indeed the mind. He indeed delights the mind. "For Tanunaptra," he says. For his bodies indeed came together. "For Shakra," he says.
6.2.2.31	For the power of yours they played together.
6.2.2.32	He says, "To the most powerful one."
6.2.2.33	For the most powerful one of yours they played.
6.2.2.34	He says "Unassailable, unassailable."
6.2.2.35	For this is unassailable, indeed, unassairable.
6.2.2.36	He says: "The strength of the gods."
6.2.2.37	For this indeed is the strength of the gods.
6.2.2.38	"May the lord of consecration be pleased with my consecration." He says this.
6.2.2.39	For the lord of consecration is indeed pleased with the consecration.
6.2.2.40	"May the lord of the consecration be pleased with me." He says this,
6.2.2.41	as per the prescribed ritual.
6.2.2.42	The gods, having made ghee into a thunderbolt, struck Soma.
6.2.2.43	As if it were near, indeed, he performs this (rite) when he performs with Tānūnaptr.
6.2.2.44	"May the shining one, the shining one, O god Soma, increase thee."
6.2.2.45	He says this because it is that which increases and is measured.
6.2.2.46	"May Indra increase for thee."
6.2.2.47	"May thou increase for Indra."
6.2.2.48	He makes both Indra and Soma flourish.
6.2.2.49	He says, "Make the friends flourish for the sacrifice."
6.2.2.50	The priests are his friends.
6.2.2.51	He makes them flourish.
6.2.2.52	He (the Adhvaryu) says, "May there be welfare for you, O divine Soma, at the Soma-pressing."
6.2.2.53	He invokes this blessing.
6.2.2.54	Those who make Soma grow, indeed, fall away from this world.
6.2.2.55	For Soma, when made to grow, is of the nature of the sky.
6.2.2.56	He says, 'Sought for wealth, for Bhaga.'
6.2.2.57	Having bowed to heaven and earth, they stand firm in this world.
6.2.2.58	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a fight.
6.2.2.59	The gods, being afraid, entered Agni.
6.2.2.60	Therefore they say, "Agni is all the deities."
6.2.2.61	Having made Agni their protector, they overcame the Asuras.
6.2.2.62	Indeed, he who enters the intermediate initiation enters as if into Agni, for the purpose of overpowering his enemies.
6.2.2.63	One becomes oneself.
6.2.2.64	One's enemy becomes inferior.
6.2.2.65	One protects oneself through initiation.
6.2.2.66	The offspring by the intermediate consecration.
6.2.2.67	He puts on the girdle belt.
6.2.2.68	The offspring are more intimate than the self.
6.2.2.69	He becomes one who has undergone the ordeal.
6.2.2.70	He cleanses with the Madanti hymns.
6.2.2.71	For Agni blows in the cold for the sake of kindling.
6.2.2.72	He says, "That form of yours, O Agni, which is Rudra-like."
6.2.2.73	He himself consecrates it with the deity for the sake of progeny and peace.
6.2.3.1	Of those Asuras, there were three cities, the lowest one was of iron, the middle one of silver, and the highest one of gold.
6.2.3.2	The gods were unable to conquer them.
6.2.3.3	They conquered them by means of the Upasads.
6.2.3.4	Therefore they say, "He who knows this and he who does not know this,"
6.2.3.5	"One conquers the great city by means of the Upaṣads."
6.2.3.6	They made Agni the arrow, Soma the wound, Vishnu the ointment.
6.2.3.7	They said, "Who will be the owner of this?"
6.2.3.8	They said, "Rudra." Rudra is fierce, he will be the owner."
6.2.3.9	He said,
6.2.3.10	"I choose a boon."
6.2.3.11	"May I be the lord of animals."
6.2.3.12	Therefore Rudra is the lord of cattle.
6.2.3.13	Rudra let it loose.
6.2.3.14	He struck three cities and drove out the Asuras from these worlds.
6.2.3.15	When one approaches the Upasads, it is for the purpose of driving away one's enemies.
6.2.3.16	One should not offer any other oblation before (the Upasads).
6.2.3.17	If one were to offer another oblation before (the main oblation), one would make another mouth.
6.2.3.18	One offers the oblation with the ladle for the recognition of the sacrifice.
6.2.3.19	Having gone beyond, one offers.
6.2.3.20	Having gone away from these worlds, the sacrificer drives away his rivals.
6.2.3.21	Having gone back, one offers the oblation at the Upasad.
6.2.3.22	Having thus pushed aside these worlds, having conquered the worlds of his enemies, he ascends to the world of his enemies.
6.2.3.23	The gods, having attended the morning Upasads, pushed aside the Asuras with those (Upasads).
6.2.3.24	Those who attended the evening (Upasads) with the night, with those (Upasaḍs).
6.2.3.25	When one performs the Upasads in the evening and morning, then the sacrificer pushes away his rivals by means of day and night.
6.2.3.26	One should perform the Puronuvākyās in the evening, which are to be performed in the morning, for the sake of non-exhaustion.
6.2.3.27	One performs three Upasads.
6.2.3.28	These are the three worlds.
6.2.3.29	He pleases these worlds.
6.2.3.30	Six are accomplished.
6.2.3.31	There are six seasons.
6.2.3.32	He pleases the seasons.
6.2.3.33	If the Soma offering is performed in the twelfth month,
6.2.3.34	the year has twelve months.
6.2.3.35	He pleases (the year).
6.2.3.36	They amount to twenty-four.
6.2.3.37	There are twenty-four half-months.
6.2.3.38	He pleases half-months.
6.2.3.39	One who desires to be a half-owner in this world should perform the initiation of the Aragra Avantara.
6.2.3.40	One, then two, then three, then four - this is the initiation of the Avantara of the Aragra.
6.2.3.41	One becomes a half-owner only in this world.
6.2.3.42	One who desires to have a share in the other world should perform the Parāvarīyasa Avāntara-Dīkṣā.
6.2.3.43	Four, then three, then two, then one. This is the Parāvarīsya Avāntara Dīkṣā
6.2.3.44	He indeed has a share in the next world.
6.2.4.1	Those who perform the Upasads go to the heavenly world.
6.2.4.2	He who takes them up, he alone is diminished.
6.2.4.3	"He who takes them up is diminished."
6.2.4.4	"He who is diminished is diminished."
6.2.4.5	He who is diminished, he dwells with the one who is diminished.
6.2.4.6	Therefore, having taken them up once, one should not take them up again.
6.2.4.7	One should take them up with curd.
6.2.4.8	This is the form of cattle.
6.2.4.9	By means of the form, one obtains cattle.
6.2.4.10	The sacrifice went away from the gods, assuming the form of Vishnu.
6.2.4.11	It entered the earth.
6.2.4.12	The gods, holding it by the hands, desired it.
6.2.4.13	Indra went over and over it.
6.2.4.14	He said, "Who went over and over me?"
6.2.4.15	"I am the one who kills in the difficult places."
6.2.4.16	Then he said, "Who are you?"
6.2.4.17	"I bring it from the difficult places."
6.2.4.18	He said:
6.2.4.19	"O Durga, you said that this boar is the most difficult to kill."
6.2.4.20	"Beyond the seven mountains, it carries the wealth of the Asuras. Kill it if you are the killer, O Durga."
6.2.4.21	He uprooted a bundle of darbha grass, broke through the seven mountains and killed it.
6.2.4.22	He said:
6.2.4.23	The one who brought it from the fort said, "Bring this."
6.2.4.24	He brought the sacrifice from the sacrifice.
6.2.4.25	What wealth was to be known by the Asuras, they found it to be one thing, to be known by those who know.
6.2.4.26	This was the foremost of the Asuras.
6.2.4.27	As far as one can see while sitting, that much was of the gods.
6.2.4.28	The gods said, "Let there be for us even in this (world)."
6.2.4.29	"How much will you give us?"
6.2.4.30	"As long as this female jackal goes around three times."
6.2.4.31	Indra, assuming the form of a female jackal, went around this (world) three times from all sides.
6.2.4.32	They found her.
6.2.4.33	What they found is the knowledge of the Veda.
6.2.4.34	This very earth is the entire altar.
6.2.4.35	"As much as I can do."
6.2.4.36	They worship you, the lowest.
6.2.4.37	Thirty steps are at the back, six and thirty in front, twenty-four steps are at the front, oblique.
6.2.4.38	Ten and ten are completed.
6.2.4.39	The Viraj has ten syllables.
6.2.4.40	Food is Viraj.
6.2.4.41	One obtains food by means of Viraj.
6.2.4.42	It is removed.
6.2.4.43	Whatever impurity there is in it, that is removed.
6.2.4.44	It is removed.
6.2.4.45	Therefore plants wither.
6.2.4.46	He strews the sacrificial grass.
6.2.4.47	Therefore plants grow again.
6.2.4.48	He strew the northern sacrificial grass.
6.2.4.49	Sacrificial grass is offspring.
6.2.4.50	The northern sacrificial grass is the sacrificer.
6.2.4.51	He makes the sacrificer superior to the non-sacrificer.
6.2.4.52	Therefore the sacrificer is superior to the non-sacrificer.
6.2.5.1	If one who is not the lord takes up a burden, he is indeed broken.
6.2.5.2	If the Upasads of the twelve-day (sacrifice) were to be three, the sacrifice of the three-day (sacrifice), would be reversed.
6.2.5.3	The Upasads of twelve-day (sacrifices) are three, and of the three-days (sacrifices) twelve, for the sake of the strength of the sacrifice.
6.2.5.4	And it is done in the same order.
6.2.5.5	One teat of the calf.
6.2.5.6	For he is a sharer in it.
6.2.5.7	Then he undertakes the vow of one breast, then of two, then of three, then of four.
6.2.5.8	This is called the vow of the razor-edge, by which one drives away the born enemies and repels the unborn ones.
6.2.5.9	And he approaches the younger one, and then the elder.
6.2.5.10	He goes to the four breasts, then to three, then to two, then to one.
6.2.5.11	This is the vow called Sujagha, leading to heaven.
6.2.5.12	One is born with offspring and cattle.
6.2.5.13	Barley-gruel is the vow for a Kshatriya.
6.2.5.14	Barley gruel is cruel.
6.2.5.15	The Kshatriya is like barley gruel.
6.2.5.16	The form of the thunderbolt is for prosperity.
6.2.5.17	The milk-rice is for the Vaishya.
6.2.5.18	The form of the Paakayajna is for prosperity.
6.2.5.19	Milk is for the Brahmana.
6.2.5.20	The Brahmana is splendour.
6.2.5.21	Milk is splendour.
6.2.5.22	He takes splendour into himself by means of splendour.
6.2.5.23	And indeed, the foetus grows by means of milk.
6.2.5.24	The one who is consecrated is indeed like a foetus.
6.2.5.25	When his vow is milk, he nourishes himself.
6.2.5.26	Manu had three vows.
6.2.5.27	The Asuras had two vows.
6.2.5.28	The Devas had one vow.
6.2.5.29	In the morning, at midday, and in the evening, that was Manu's vow.
6.2.5.30	The form of the Pākayajña is for prosperity.
6.2.5.31	In the early morning and in the evening for the Asuras, there is no midday.
6.2.5.32	The form is hunger.
6.2.5.33	Then they were defeated.
6.2.5.34	At midday and midnight for the Devas.
6.2.5.35	Then they became.
6.2.5.36	He goes to the heavenly world.
6.2.5.37	Whatever vow he observes at midday or midnight, he eats food in the middle.
6.2.5.38	He bestows energy in the middle for the sake of overpowering his enemies.
6.2.5.39	He becomes himself.
6.2.5.40	His enemy becomes inferior.
6.2.5.41	The consecrated one is indeed a foetus.
6.2.5.42	The consecrated area is the womb.
6.2.5.43	If a consecrated person goes away from the consecrated fire, it is as if a foetus falls from the womb.
6.2.5.44	One should not go away for the protection of oneself.
6.2.5.45	This is indeed the tiger, the protector of the family, that is Agni.
6.2.5.46	Therefore, if a consecrated person goes far away, that lord may follow him and kill him.
6.2.5.47	One should go away for the safety of oneself.
6.2.5.48	One should sleep on the right side.
6.2.5.49	This is the place of the sacrificer.
6.2.5.50	He sleeps in his own place.
6.2.5.51	He sleeps, turning towards the fire.
6.2.5.52	He sleeps turning towards the deity, the sacrifice.
6.2.6.1	One should offer to the one whom one desires, in the front-offering, the offering to the gods.
6.2.6.2	The subsequent sacrifice would bow down to him.
6.2.6.3	He would conquer the heavenly world.
6.2.6.4	This is the sacrifice to the gods in the morning, when the Hotri recites the morning hymn and sees the fire and the sun.
6.2.6.5	The later sacrifice bows down to him.
6.2.6.6	He conquers the heavenly world.
6.2.6.7	One should perform the sacrifice to the Gods when the sacrifice to the ancestors has been completed, for one who has an enemy.
6.2.6.8	One should touch the path or the cart.
6.2.6.9	as long as the horses do not go to the chariots.
6.2.6.10	This is the proper place for the sacrifice to the gods.
6.2.6.11	One attains one's enemy.
6.2.6.12	One's enemy does not attain one.
6.2.6.13	One should sacrifice at a place that is slightly elevated for one who desires cattle.
6.2.6.14	From a place that is elevated for the sacrifice to gods, the Angiras created cattle.
6.2.6.15	The elevated place should be between the sacrificial hall and the sacrificial post.
6.2.6.16	This is the only elevated place for the sacrifice to the gods.
6.2.6.17	One becomes possessed of cattle.
6.2.6.18	One should perform the sacrifice to the god on a place elevated three times for one desiring heaven.
6.2.6.19	From the place elevated three times, the Angiras went to heaven.
6.2.6.20	The place between the Ahavaniya and the Havirdhana should be elevated, the place between the Havirdhana and the Sadas, and the place between the Sadas and the Garhapatya.
6.2.6.21	This is the altar of the gods, raised in three places.
6.2.6.22	He goes to the heavenly world.
6.2.6.23	One should sacrifice at the altar which is established, for one who desires stability.
6.2.6.24	This is the altar of gods, established, which is even on all sides.
6.2.6.25	He indeed stands firm.
6.2.6.26	One should offer sacrifice at the place where other plants are intermingled, for one who wishes for cattle.
6.2.6.27	This is indeed the form of cattle.
6.2.6.28	By means of form alone he wins cattle for him.
6.2.6.29	He indeed becomes possessed of cattle.
6.2.6.30	If one desires, "May I seize his sacrifice with Nirriti," one should offer at a place seized by Nirriti.
6.2.6.31	This is the place seized by Nirrti, where the Rks are similar to each other.
6.2.6.32	He indeed seizes his sacrifice with Nirrti.
6.2.6.33	If the Devayajana is turned away, one should offer to one who desires to turn away. If they are to be examined either in a vessel or on a bed,
6.2.6.34	The Ahāvanyīya should be sloping towards the east, and the Garhapatya towards the west.
6.2.6.35	This indeed is the Devayajna turned away.
6.2.6.36	One turns away from evil, from one's enemy.
6.2.6.37	They do not examine him either in a vessel nor on a bed.
6.2.6.38	If one desires prosperity, one should sacrifice to the deity in a ritual.
6.2.6.39	A person is indeed a ritual.
6.2.6.40	It becomes so.
6.2.7.1	The Uttaravedi (northern altar) took the form of a lioness and stood between them, having gone beyond both.
6.2.7.2	The gods thought, "She will turn back and return to us, and we will be here."
6.2.7.3	They invited her.
6.2.7.4	She said,
6.2.7.5	"I choose a boon."
6.2.7.6	All the desires of us may be fulfilled.
6.2.7.7	The first oblation to Agni is consumed.
6.2.7.8	Therefore they spread the northern altar before Agni.
6.2.7.9	For it is the enclosure of him.
6.2.7.10	He measures with the Samya.
6.2.7.11	It is just the size of it.
6.2.7.12	And he unites the yoked with the yoked.
6.2.7.13-20	"You are the one who brings wealth." He says this. Because they bring wealth. "You are the one with bitter (wealth)." He says this. Because they are bitter. "You bring me protection." He says this because they bring protection. "You protect me from distress." He says this, because they protect from distress. "You relieve me of distress." He says, because they relieve distress.
6.2.7.21	The Agni of the Videhas, the Agni of the sky, the Agni of Angiras, he takes three times.
6.2.7.22	He obtains those very fires that are in these worlds.
6.2.7.23	He takes the fourth silently.
6.2.7.24	He obtains the undefined.
6.2.7.25	You are a lioness.
6.2.7.26	He says, "You are a she-buffalo."
6.2.7.27	For she is a lioness, and having assumed the form of both, she stands between.
6.2.7.28	"He says, "Be extensive, be extensive, may thy lord of sacrifice be extensive."
6.2.7.29	He makes the sacrificer extensive with offspring and cattle.
6.2.7.30	"He strikes (the Soma) with, "Be firm." For firmness.
6.2.7.31	"Purify for the gods."
6.2.7.32	"Purify the gods."
6.2.7.33	He pours down and scatters (the Soma) for purification.
6.2.7.34	Indraghosha protects you.
6.2.7.35	He says, "May Vasus protect you from the east."
6.2.7.36	He sprinkles her from the directions.
6.2.7.37	If the Uttaravedi had fallen on this side, we would have won here. The Asuras raised the thunderbolt and attacked the gods.
6.2.7.38	Indra-Ghoṣa, with the Vasus in front, repelled them; Pracetas, with the Pitṛs on the right, repelled them; Viśvakarman, with the Ādityas behind, repelled them.
6.2.7.39	When he sprinkles the northern altar thus,
6.2.7.40	the sacrificer repels his rivals from the quarters.
6.2.7.41	Indra gave the ascetic to the jackals.
6.2.7.42	He should place them on the southern side of the northern altar.
6.2.7.43	Whatever remains of the sprinkling water, he should take it to the southern side of northern altar.
6.2.7.44	He appeases whatever is fierce there by that.
6.2.7.45	He should meditate on the one whom he hates.
6.2.7.46	He gives him peace.
6.2.8.1	The northern altar said, "You all enjoy all desires through me."
6.2.8.2	Those gods desired, 'May we conquer our enemies, the Asuras.'
6.2.8.3	They offered.
6.2.8.4	'You are a lioness, conquering enemies, svāhā!'
6.2.8.5	They conquered their enemies, the Asura brothers.
6.2.8.6	Having conquered their enemies, they desired, 'May they obtain offspring.'
6.2.8.7	They offered.
6.2.8.8	"Thou art the lioness, the giver of offspring, svāhā."
6.2.8.9	They found offspring.
6.2.8.10	Having found offspring, they desired:
6.2.8.11	"May we find cattle."
6.2.8.12	They offered:
6.2.8.13	"Thou art the lion, the giver of prosperity, svāhā.”
6.2.8.14	They found cattle.
6.2.8.15	Having found cattle, they desired: "
6.2.8.16	"May we obtain stability."
6.2.8.17	They offered.
6.2.8.18	" "O lioness, may the sun be your abode, svāhā."
6.2.8.19	They found this support.
6.2.8.20	Having found this support, they desired,
6.2.8.21	"May we approach the blessings of the deities."
6.2.8.22	They offered.
6.2.8.23	"O lioness, bring the gods to the sacrificer who worships, svāhā."
6.2.8.24	They approached the blessings of the gods.
6.2.8.25-31	He pours five times. The Paṅkti has five syllables. The sacrifice is Paṅkti. He indeed wins the sacrifice. He pours with the eye. Therefore animals strike with their eyes. For stability. He takes up the ladle, saying, "For the beings."
6.2.8.32	Those who are the gods, that is their share.
6.2.8.33	He pleases them with that.
6.2.8.34	He places the Pautrīdravā paridhi-sticks (around the fire) for the support of these worlds.
6.2.8.35	Agni had three elder brothers.
6.2.8.36	They were carrying oblations to the gods.
6.2.8.37	Agni was afraid, "In this way, he will indeed cause me harm."
6.2.8.38	He was born.
6.2.8.39	He was born among the trees, among the Pūtu trees.
6.2.8.40	He was among the plants, among the fragrant plants.
6.2.8.41	He was in the animals, between the horns of the goat.
6.2.8.42	The gods wanted to surround him.
6.2.8.43	They found him.
6.2.8.44	They said to him, "Come back to us, carry our oblations."
6.2.8.45	He said,
6.2.8.46	"I choose a boon.
6.2.8.47	Whatever of the grasped and unoffered (oblation) falls outside the enclosing sticks, that is the share of my brothers.
6.2.8.48	Therefore, whatever of the grasped and offered falls outside the enclosing-sticks, that is their share. He pleases them with that.
6.2.8.49	He thought: 'My former brothers have become weak. They have become weak.'
6.2.8.50	The bones which he broke up became Puutradruva.
6.2.8.51	The flesh which was dead became Guggulu.
6.2.8.52	When he collects these materials, he collects Agni.
6.2.8.53	He says, "You are the excrement of Agni."
6.2.8.54	For this is the excrement of the Agni, namely, the materials.
6.2.8.55	Now they say, these very ones, the Pautrīdara (priests), protect him, because they are the enclosing (priests).
6.2.9.1	He releases (the sacrificer) who is bound.
6.2.9.2	He releases him from Varuna's noose.
6.2.9.3	He makes him go forward.
6.2.9.4	He makes them fit for sacrifice.
6.2.9.5	Having offered with the Savitri verse, he makes the fire move towards the Havirdhana (shed).
6.2.9.6	He makes it move forward with the impulse of Savitri.
6.2.9.7	Varuna is the bad speech, and the dice are bound on both sides.
6.2.9.8	If he were to throw them away, he would throw them away from the sacrificer's house.
6.2.9.9	He says, "O good god, you have spoken bad words."
6.2.9.10	The house is bad speech, for peace.
6.2.9.11	He anoints the wife.
6.2.9.12	The wife is the friend of all, for friendship.
6.2.9.13	Whatever the wife does for the sacrifice, it is a couple.
6.2.9.14	Now, this is the continuation of the sacrifice by the wife, for non-separation.
6.2.9.15	The Raksases seek to injure the sacrifice by following the path.
6.2.9.16	He offers on the two paths with two verses addressed to Vishnu.
6.2.9.17	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
6.2.9.18	He thus drives away the Raksases from the sacrifice.
6.2.9.19	If the Adhvaryu were to offer a libation in a fire without kindling, the Adhvaryus would become blind and the Rakshas would destroy the sacrifice.
6.2.9.20	Having placed gold, he offers.
6.2.9.21	He offers in a fire with kindling.
6.2.9.22	The Adhvaryu does not become blind and the Raksases do not destroy the sacrifice. "
6.2.9.23	(He says) "The Adhvaras which are to be offered to the east are being arranged."
6.2.9.24	He indeed sends them to the heavenly world.
6.2.9.25	"He says, "May you delight in this, O Varṣman, in the expanse of the earth."
6.2.9.26	For this is indeed the expanse of the Earth, namely the Devayajana (sacrificial post).
6.2.9.27	The Havirdhana (sacrificial post) is indeed the head of this sacrifice.
6.2.9.28	"He recites, "From heaven or from earth, O Vishnu,"
6.2.9.29	and strikes the southern Havirdhana post with a verse containing the word 'blessing.'
6.2.9.30	The sacrificer obtains the blessings of the sacrifice from the top itself.
6.2.9.31	The stick of the third Havirdhāna fell down at the Vasat-call.
6.2.9.32	The third covering of the Havirdhāna is brought up for the obtaining of the third Havirdhāna.
6.2.9.33	The Havirdhāna indeed is the head of the sacrifice.
6.2.9.34	You are the king of Viṣṇu.
6.2.9.35	"He says, 'Thou art the back of Vishnu.'
6.2.9.36	Therefore the head is spread out to this extent.
6.2.9.37	'Thou art the seam of Vishnu.'
6.2.9.38	'Thou art firm of Vishnu,' he says.
6.2.9.39	For the Havirdhana is indeed Vishnu as the deity.
6.2.9.40	If one were to tie the first knot, and if one were not to loosen it, the Adhvaryu would be afflicted with urine.
6.2.9.41	Therefore, it is to be discarded.
6.2.10.1	He takes up the wooden sword with the formula, "In the impulse of the divine Savitr," for the purpose of instigation.
6.2.10.2	He says, "With the arms of the Asvins."
6.2.10.3	For the Asvins were the Adhvaryus of the gods.
6.2.10.4	He says "With the hands of Pusan" for the purpose of consecration.
6.2.10.5	For this (wooden sword) is like a thunderbolt.
6.2.10.6	Thou art the wooden sword.
6.2.10.7	"You are not a woman," he says for peace.
6.2.10.8	When the sacrifice is being performed in each section, the demons seek to injure it.
6.2.10.9	The Rakshas is written around.
6.2.10.10	"The enemies are written around," he says for the destruction of the Rakshas.
6.2.10.11	"This I cut off the neck of the Rakshasa who hates us and whom we hate," he says.
6.2.10.12	There are indeed two persons, the one who hates and the one who is hated.
6.2.10.13	He cuts off the neck of the one who hates him and the one who hates.
6.2.10.14	He says, "For the heaven, for the atmosphere, for the earth."
6.2.10.15	He sprinkles him from these worlds.
6.2.10.16	He sprinkles him beyond and below.
6.2.10.17	Therefore, beyond and below, men live on food.
6.2.10.18	It is as if he were doing something cruel when he digs.
6.2.10.19	He pours down water for peace.
6.2.10.20	He pours it down with barley.
6.2.10.21	Barley is strength.
6.2.10.22	The Udumbara is strength.
6.2.10.23	He makes strength prosper with strength.
6.2.10.24	The udumbara is equal to the sacrificer.
6.2.10.25	He places as much strength in him as the sacrificer is.
6.2.10.26	"This is the abode of the Fathers," he strews the sacrificial grass.
6.2.10.27	For the Fathers are the deities of what is dug in.
6.2.10.28	If one were to dig without strewing the sacrificial grass, what is dug in would be without the deity of the Fathers.
6.2.10.29	He digs after strewing the sacrificial grasses.
6.2.10.30	He digs it in this very (earth).
6.2.10.31	And he makes it his own.
6.2.10.32	"He says, 'Thou hast risen up to heaven, thou hast filled the atmosphere,' for the sake of the maintenance of these worlds.
6.2.10.33	He says, 'The wind-god Dyutatana has placed thee.'
6.2.10.34	The wind-god, indeed, Dyutatana places the Udumbara tree of the gods.
6.2.10.35	He places it with the same (wind-god).
6.2.10.36	He says, '(Thou art) the abode of Brahman, the abode of the Kshatra.'
6.2.10.37	This is in accordance with the prescribed rite.
6.2.10.38-44	"With ghee, do ye fill heaven and earth," he offers on the Udumbara (wood). He anoints heaven and earth with juice. He pours down to the end. He anoints the sacrificer with brilliance to the end. He places the covering-wood with the formula, "Thou art Indra." The hall is indeed Indra as the deity. He says, "In the shade of the assembly of all people."
6.2.10.45	This is the shadow of the world-people.
6.2.10.46	One should spread the nine-layered (altar) for one who desires brilliance.
6.2.10.47	It is measured by the Trivrt stoma.
6.2.10.48	Brilliance is Trivrt.
6.2.10.49	One becomes brilliant.
6.2.10.50	The eleven-layered (altar), for one who desires power.
6.2.10.51	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
6.2.10.52	Power is Tristubh.
6.2.10.53	One becomes powerful.
6.2.10.54	The one with fifteen layers is for one who desires to overcome his enemies.
6.2.10.55	The fifteen-layered one is the thunderbolt, for overcoming enemies.
6.2.10.56	The one with seventeen layers is for one desiring offspring.
6.2.10.57	The seventeen-layered one is Prajapati, for attaining Prajapati.
6.2.10.58	The one having twenty-one layers is for one desirous of stability.
6.2.10.59	The twenty-one-layered one is of the Stoma, for stability, for stability.
6.2.10.60	The Sadas is the belly.
6.2.10.61	The Udumbara is food.
6.2.10.62-68	He places the Udumbara (wood) in the middle. He places the energy of beings in the middle itself. Therefore, they eat energy in the middle. The southern branches are in the world of the sacrificer, the northern ones in the world of his enemy. He makes the southern ones northern. He makes his own sacrificer superior to the sacrificer.
6.2.10.69	Therefore the sacrificer is superior to the non-sacrificer.
6.2.10.70	He makes them face inward for exclusion.
6.2.10.71	Therefore the people live on the forest.
6.2.10.72	He says, "O Indra, thy praise."
6.2.10.73	This is as per the injunction.
6.2.10.74	Thou art the thread of Indra.
6.2.10.75	He says "Thou art the firm of Indra."
6.2.10.76	For the assembly hall is indeed Indra as the deity.
6.2.10.77	If the Adhvaryu were to let the first knot slip, he would be afflicted with a urinary disease.
6.2.10.78	Therefore, it should be loosened.
6.2.11.1	The Havirdhāna is indeed the head of the sacrifice, and the Uparavas are the vital airs.
6.2.11.2	They are placed in the Havirdhāna.
6.2.11.3	Therefore, the vital airs are in the head.
6.2.11.4	They are laid down below.
6.2.11.5	Therefore, below the head are the vital airs.
6.2.11.6	"He says, 'I dig the Vaishnavans, the destroyers of Rakshas, the destroyers of Valag.'
6.2.11.7	The Vaishnavans are the gods who are the destroyers.
6.2.11.8	The Asuras, while fleeing, dug the Valags in the vital breaths of the gods.
6.2.11.9	They found them up to the elbows.
6.2.11.10	Therefore they are dug up to the elbows."
6.2.11.11	This is the Valagh that I am offering up, the one that is common to us and the one that is not common to us." He says this.
6.2.11.12	There are indeed two kinds of persons, the one who is common and the one who is not common.
6.2.11.13	He offers up the Valagh which is dug up for him by those two.
6.2.11.14	It is sprinkled.
6.2.11.15	Therefore the internal breaths are sprinkled.
6.2.11.16	He does not break it.
6.2.11.17	Therefore the vital airs are not interrupted.
6.2.11.18	He pours down water.
6.2.11.19	Therefore the vital airs are moist within.
6.2.11.20	He pours the Yavamatī (grasses).
6.2.11.21	Yava is strength.
6.2.11.22	The vital airs are the Uparavas.
6.2.11.23	He places strength in the vital airs.
6.2.11.24	He spreads the sacrificial grass.
6.2.11.25	Therefore the hairs are hairy within.
6.2.11.26	He sprinkles with ghee.
6.2.11.27-34	The ghee is the brilliance. The Uparavas are the vital breaths. He places brilliance in the vital breaths. The two Adhiṣavaṇas are the jaws of the sacrifice. One does not cut off (the Adhiṣavaṇa) because the jaws are not cut off. And also in the long Soma sacrifice, one cuts off (the Adhishvaṇas) for stability. The Havirdhāna is indeed the head of the sacrifice.
6.2.11.35	The Prāṇas are the Uparavas, the lips the Adhiṣaṇas, the tongue the skin, the teeth the Gravas, the mouth the Āhavanīya, the nose the Uttaravedi, the belly the Sadas.
6.2.11.36	When the tongue eats the teeth, then it goes to the mouth.
6.2.11.37	When it goes to the month, then it goes into the belly.
6.2.11.38	Therefore, having offered on the sacrificial grass, having pressed the Soma in the pressing stones, having offered on fire, having returned to the east, they consume in the assembly.
6.2.11.39	He who knows the milking of Viraj at the mouth of the sacrifice, milks her indeed.
6.2.11.40	This is Viraj.
6.2.11.41	Its skin is the sacrificial grass, the pressing stones are the udders, the pressing stones the nipples, the Soma the calves, the priests milk the Soma juice.
6.2.11.42	He who knows thus, indeed, obtains it.
6.3.1.1	He sows the sacrificial grass on the Catvāla (altar).
6.3.1.2	The Catvāla is the womb of the sacrifice.
6.3.1.3	For the sacrifice to have a womb.
6.3.1.4	The gods conquered the sacrifice.
6.3.1.5	They conquered it again from the Agnidhra.
6.3.1.6	This is the unconquered part of the sacrifice, namely, the Agnidhra (altar).
6.3.1.7	When he spreads the sacrificial grass on Agnidhra (from the Catvāla),
6.3.1.8	Whatever is invincible in the sacrifice, from that alone he again makes him.
6.3.1.9	Indeed, those who go to the Bahispavamāna go as if defeated.
6.3.1.10	At the Bahispavamaņa, having praised, he says:
6.3.1.11	"O Agni, spread the fires."
6.3.1.12	"Spread the grass."
6.3.1.13	"Make the cakes ready."
6.3.1.14	Going again as if having conquered the sacrifice, they go.
6.3.1.15	He wanders at two pressings with coals.
6.3.1.16	At the third pressing with sticks.
6.3.1.17	For the sake of having semen.
6.3.1.18	And indeed he gathers it.
6.3.1.19	In the world beyond, the Soma was guarded by the Adhvanas.
6.3.1.20	They brought the Soma to them.
6.3.1.21	They followed it and surrounded it.
6.3.1.22	He who knows thus, obtains a surrounding.
6.3.1.23	They were afflicted by drinking Soma.
6.3.1.24	They desired to drink Soma among the gods.
6.3.1.25	The gods said to them,
6.3.1.26	"Make two names for yourselves.
6.3.1.27	Then you will drink or not."
6.3.1.28	The fires and the Dhishnyas.
6.3.1.29	Therefore a Brahman who knows two names is a half-knower.
6.3.1.30	Those who sat down at the end of them obtained the Soma-drink. The Ahavaniya, Agnidhra, Hotra, and Marjalia fires.
6.3.1.31	Therefore they offer to them.
6.3.1.32	He makes the Vasat-call after having passed over.
6.3.1.33	For they are separated by the Soma-drink.
6.3.1.34	The gods, having offered oblations to the east, drove away the Asuras who were in front.
6.3.1.35	Those who were in the rear, they drove away with oblations to the west.
6.3.1.36	Oblations are offered to the east. Sitting towards the west, he sprinkles the sacrificial grass.
6.3.1.37	And the sacrificer drives away his enemies from behind and from in front.
6.3.1.38	Therefore offspring are born facing east and are born facing west.
6.3.1.39	The Dhishnyas are indeed the vital airs.
6.3.1.40	If the Adhvaryu were to step over the Dhishnyas facing west, he would draw the vital airs together and would be a killer.
6.3.1.41	The Hotri is indeed the navel of the sacrifice.
6.3.1.42	The Prāṇa is above the navel.
6.3.1.43	The Apāna is below.
6.3.1.44	If the Adhvaryu were to step over the Hotṛ from behind, he would place the Prāṇa in the Apāna and would be a killer.
6.3.1.45	The Adhvaryu should not sing.
6.3.1.46	The Adhvayu is the voice of the Vīrya.
6.3.1.47	If the Ādhvaryu were to sing, he would give the voice to the Udgatr. His voice would be in the Udgātṛ.
6.3.1.48	The Brahmanas say:
6.3.1.49	The Adhvaryu should not cross the Sadas with Soma not yet placed (in the Hotr's hands).
6.3.1.50	Then he goes to offer the Dakshina oblations.
6.3.1.51	Because that is their (Hotr's) duty.
6.3.1.52	"Why should the gods know whether it is Yama or Vayu?"
6.3.1.53	Having gone around north of the Agnidhra chamber, he offers the Dakshina offerings.
6.3.1.54	He does not draw the breath to its end.
6.3.2.6	He steps on the space between the two fires.
6.3.2.7	He offers on the Ahavaniya fire.
6.3.2.8	He sends him to the world of heaven.
6.3.2.9	The gods, when they were going to the world of Svarga, were attacked by the Rakshas.
6.3.2.10	They, having repelled the Rakshas with Soma, the king, and having made themselves fit, went to the world of svarga.
6.3.2.11	For the non-obtaining of the Rakshas,
6.3.2.12	Soma is taken.
6.3.2.13-24	Then he offers the oblations of dismissal. For the removal of Rakshas. He says, "You, O Soma, to those who have assumed a form." He says, "For those who have assumed the form." "From those who are hostile and from those who are not hostile." He says. "For Rakshas are not hostile." "You are the protector of the extensive." He says "Make me extensive." He indeed says this.
6.3.2.25	"May he enjoy the ghee, may he be the recipient of the ghee."
6.3.2.26	He says.
6.3.2.27	Having made the sacrificer the recipient, he sends him to the world of heaven.
6.3.2.28	For the non-obstruction of the Rakshas.
6.3.2.29	They give the Soma to the pressing stones, to the Vāyu-vessel, to the Dronakalaśa.
6.3.2.30	They bring in the wife.
6.3.2.31	They turn the Anāsas. 
6.3.2.32	As long as he has that, he goes to heaven with him.
6.3.2.33	One offers in the Agnihotra fire with the Naya-verse.
6.3.2.34	For the attainment of the heavenly world.
6.3.2.35	One places the Dronakalaśa in the Agnihotra house with the Vāyu-verses.
6.3.2.36	Because they take him with those (verses).
6.3.2.37	If one were to place them together, one would be without a house.
6.3.2.38	One makes the offering with the Sūrya-verse.
6.3.2.39	He himself makes him enter by means of his own deity.
6.3.2.40	"You are the seat of Aditi."
6.3.2.41	"He sits on the seat of Aditis."
6.3.2.42	He says.
6.3.2.43	It is as per the prescribed procedure.
6.3.2.44	The sacrificer is the protector of this (Soma) before.
6.3.2.45	"This is your Soma, O god Savitr."
6.3.2.46	He says:
6.3.2.47	He hands him over to the deities with the impulse of Savitr.
6.3.2.48	"This, O Soma, you, the god, have approached the gods."
6.3.2.49	He says:
6.3.2.50	"For he, being a god, approaches the gods."
6.3.2.51	"This, I, a human being, have approached human beings."
6.3.2.52	He says
6.3.2.53	"For he being a human being approaches human beings."
6.3.2.54	If one does not recite this mantra, the sacrificer would be without offspring and cattle.
6.3.2.55-65	Together with offspring, together with prosperity." He says: "One goes to this world together with offspring and cattle." "He says: 'Salutations to the gods.'" He says: "Salutations are indeed of the gods." "He (the Adhvaryu) says: 'Svāhā to the fathers.' He says: 'Svādhakāra is indeed of the fathers.' "He says, 'This I release from Varuna's noose.' He says:
6.3.2.66	He is freed from the noose of Varuna.
6.3.2.67	O Agni, lord of vows!
6.3.2.68	They say that the earlier body of the Self is to be given up, for who knows what is better than one's own control? Whether one gives it back or not?
6.3.2.69	The stones are the impurities of King Soma.
6.3.2.70	One who knows this, and who, knowing this, makes the Agnidhra perform the fasting rite, does not get afflicted by the Malimlusa.
6.3.3.1	Having offered with the Vaisnavya verse, he cuts down the sacrificial post.
6.3.3.2	The sacrificial post is Vaisnava in deity.
6.3.3.3	He cuts it down with its own deity.
6.3.3.4	He says, "I have gone beyond others, I have not gone to others."
6.3.3.5	He says.
6.3.3.6	For he goes beyond others, he does not go to others.
6.3.3.7	I know you from afar, not from near, and from near, not from afar.
6.3.3.8	He says:
6.3.3.9	One knows him from afar, not near, and from afar, not nearby.
6.3.3.10	"I accept you for the worship of the gods."
6.3.3.11	He says: "
6.3.3.12	For the worship of the Gods, indeed, they accept him.
6.3.3.13	"May the god Savitar anoint you with honey."
6.3.3.14	He says:
6.3.3.15-22	He anoints him with the lustre itself. "He says, 'O plant, protect him, O Swadhiti, do not injure him.' " "He says: "Swadhiti is indeed a thunderbolt. "For peace. "When one is afraid of the wood of Swadhiti, the lustre falls down with the first piece. "If the first piece falls down, one should also bring that. "He brings him with lustre.
6.3.3.23	These worlds are afraid of the sacrificial post.
6.3.3.24	He (the sacrificer) goes to heaven with the front part, to the atmosphere with the middle part, and says, "Do not injure me."
6.3.3.25	He says,
6.3.3.26	He pacifies him from these worlds.
6.3.3.27	"O Vanaspati, grow with a hundred shoots."
6.3.3.28	He offers in the Avraścana (vessel).
6.3.3.29	Therefore, from the Avraścanā, the trees grow more.
6.3.3.30	"We have risen up with a thousand shoots."
6.3.3.31	He says.
6.3.3.32	He indeed prays for this blessing.
6.3.3.33	If one were to erect a pillar without a hole for the axle.
6.3.3.34	If one would erect a pillar without an axle-hole, the sacrificer's house would be destroyed.
6.3.3.35	If one desires:
6.3.3.36	"May he be without a foundation."
6.3.3.37	One should erect a pillar for him.
6.3.3.38	This indeed is the foundationless among the trees.
6.3.3.39	He becomes unestablished.
6.3.3.40	If one desires:
6.3.3.41	"He should be without cattle."
6.3.3.42	If one sprinkles a dry tip to him,
6.3.3.43	This is the one among the trees that is without cattle.
6.3.3.44	He becomes without cattle.
6.3.3.45	If one wishes:
6.3.3.46	"He may have cattle."
6.3.3.47	If he sprinkles a tip with many leaves and many branches to him,
6.3.3.48	this is the one among trees that has cattle.
6.3.3.49	He becomes possessed of cattle.
6.3.3.50	If one were to cut down a tree that is standing, one should do so for one who desires stability.
6.3.3.51	This indeed is the standing tree among trees, which grows from its own source on level ground.
6.3.3.52	One indeed stands firm.
6.3.3.53	If one cuts down a tree that has fallen towards the west,
6.3.3.54	it has indeed approached the sacrifice.
6.3.3.55	One should cut down a tree five cubits long for one whom one desires.
6.3.3.56-65	So that the later sacrifice may bow down to him. The Panchati (verse) has five syllables. The sacrifice is fivefold. So that the later sacrifice bows down to him. (The verse) has six syllables. For one desiring stability, it should be six cubits long. There are six seasons. One indeed becomes stable in the seasons. For one who desires cattle, it should be seven cubits long. The Sakvari (verse) has seven feet. Cattle are Sakvari.
6.3.3.66-74	He indeed wins cattle. Nine cubits for one desiring brilliance. The Stoma is equal to three Vritras. Brilliance is three-fold. One indeed becomes brilliant. Eleven cubits for one who desires power. The Tristubh has eleven syllables. Power is Tristubh. One indeed obtains power. Twelve cubits for one desirous of progeny.
6.3.3.75	15 cubits for one who desires to overcome his enemies.
6.3.3.76	The thunderbolt is fifteen cubits.
6.3.3.77	For overcoming enemies.
6.3.3.78	17 cubits for one desiring offspring.
6.3.3.79	Prajapati is seventeen cubits.
6.3.3.80	To attain Prajapati.
6.3.3.81	21 cubits for one desirous of stability.
6.3.3.82	The stomas are twenty-one.
6.3.3.83	For stability.
6.3.3.84	It becomes eight-cornered.
6.3.3.85	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
6.3.3.86	The Gayatrī is brilliance.
6.3.3.87	The Gayatry is the mouth of the sacrifice.
6.3.3.88	He is measured by the Gayatri, which is brilliance, and by the mouth of the sacrfice.
6.3.4.1	He says, "For the earth, for the atmosphere, for the heaven."
6.3.4.2	He sprinkles him.
6.3.4.3	He sprinkles him from these worlds.
6.3.4.4	He sprinkles from the farthest.
6.3.4.5	The world of heaven is indeed far away.
6.3.4.6	It is as if he were doing something cruel when he digs.
6.3.4.7	He pours down water.
6.3.4.8	For peace.
6.3.4.9	He pours it down with barley.
6.3.4.10	Barley is indeed strength.
6.3.4.11	The sacrificial post is measured according to the size of the sacrificer.
6.3.4.12	He places as much strength in it as the sacrificer is in size.
6.3.4.13	"You are the abode of the fathers."
6.3.4.14	He strews the sacrificial grass.
6.3.4.15	For this (earth) is sacred to the Pitrs, when it is dug up.
6.3.4.16	If one were to dig without strewing the sacrificial grass, it would be sacred to the Pitris, when dug up.
6.3.4.17	He digs after strewing the sacrificial-grass.
6.3.4.18	He digs it in this (earth).
6.3.4.19	He puts down a piece of the sacrificial post.
6.3.4.20	He digs him with the same lustre.
6.3.4.21	"May the god Savitr anoint thee with honey."
6.3.4.22	He says.
6.3.4.23	He anoints him with brilliance.
6.3.4.24	"From the most fragrant plants."
6.3.4.25	He releases the cup.
6.3.4.26	Therefore plants take fruit from the head.
6.3.4.27	He anoint.
6.3.4.28	The ghee is brilliance.
6.3.4.29	The altar of Agni is measured with the sacrificer.
6.3.4.30	Where he anoints the Agniṣṭha (altar)
6.3.4.31	He anoints the sacrificer with splendour.
6.3.4.32	He anoints all around.
6.3.4.33	He anointes the sacrificer with all splendour.
6.3.4.34	He touches all around.
6.3.4.35	In him he places all splendour.
6.3.4.36	"He says, "May it stand above the heaven, may it fill the atmosphere."
6.3.4.37	He says,
6.3.4.38	For the support of these worlds.
6.3.4.39	He consecrates it with a verse addressed to Vishnu.
6.3.4.40	The sacrificial post is Vishnu as the deity.
6.3.4.41	He consecrates it with its own deity.
6.3.4.42	He (the Adhvaryu) consecrates it with two (verses).
6.3.4.43	The sacrificer has two feet.
6.3.4.44	For stability.
6.3.4.45	If one desires:
6.3.4.46	"I should diminish his energy and power with deities."
6.3.4.47	He should move the fire-altar from the Agniṣṭhāma to the Āhavaniya in this way or in that way.
6.3.4.48	He thus makes him prosper with his own brilliance, with the deities and with his own power.
6.3.4.49	If one desires:
6.3.4.50	"I should make him prosper with his brilliance, with the gods and with his own strength."
6.3.4.51	He should move the fire altar from the Agniṣthāma to the Āhavanīya.
6.3.4.52-60	He thus makes him prosper with the lustre of the deities and with the power. He says, "For the Brahman-region, for the Kshatra-region." As per the injunction. He moves around. The rope is indeed strength. The sacrificial post is equal to the sacrificer. He thus makes the sacrificer prosper with strength. He moves it around for the navel-region.
6.3.4.61	He places the strength at the navel.
6.3.4.62	Therefore, they eat strength up to the navel.
6.3.4.63	If one desires:
6.3.4.64	"May he be deprived of strength."
6.3.4.65	One should carry it upwards or downwards.
6.3.4.66	He is deprived of strength.
6.3.4.67	If one wishes:
6.3.4.68	"May the rain be abundant."
6.3.4.69	One should take it downwards.
6.3.4.70	He restrains the rain.
6.3.4.71	If one desires,
6.3.4.72	"One should say, "May there be no rain."
6.3.4.73	One should carry it upwards.
6.3.4.74	He restrains the rain.
6.3.4.75	The pit for the Fathers is dug below the pit for men, below that for the plants, below that for all the gods. The cup of Indra is below the cup for all the Sada deities.
6.3.4.76	This sacrificial post is indeed dedicated to all the deities.
6.3.4.77	When one erects the sacrificial post,
6.3.4.78	one pleases all the deities.
6.3.4.79	The gods went to the heavenly world by means of sacrifice.
6.3.4.80	They thought:
6.3.4.81	"Men will follow us."
6.3.4.82	Having sacrificed with the sacrificial post, they went to the heavenly worlds.
6.3.4.83	The sages followed them with the sacrificial post.
6.3.4.84	That is the reason for the sacrificial post being called a sacrificial post.
6.3.4.85	When one erects the sacrificial post,
6.3.4.86	it is for the attainment of the heavenly world.
6.3.4.87	One erects it in front,
6.3.4.88	For the sacrifice is known before.
6.3.4.89	What is unknown is what they say has passed beyond.
6.3.4.90	"This is to be done."
6.3.4.91	The gods, having performed the sacrifice, went beyond it.
6.3.4.92	The sacrifice did not touch them.
6.3.4.93	What was left over from the sacrifice, that it touched.
6.3.4.94	What is left over from the sacrificial fire is what is left over from sacrifice.
6.3.4.95-103	This is an additional part of the sacrificial post, which is above the cup. This is their share. He pleases them with this. When the Soma was settled, the gods brought forth the ladles. They brought forth the sacrificial post. They thought, "We are doing this as a part of the sacrifice." They saw the Prāstara as the ransom for the ladles, the Svaru as the ransom for the sacrificial post.
6.3.4.104	When Soma has been placed, he carries the Prastara.
6.3.4.105	He offers the Svara.
6.3.4.106	For one who is not a sacrificer.
6.3.5.1	The gods who were to be worshipped were in this world.
6.3.5.2	Nothing else was moving.
6.3.5.3	They offered Agni to Agni for wisdom.
6.3.5.4	For they did not find anything else to be offered.
6.3.5.5	From that these beings were born.
6.3.5.6	When one kindles fire in the fire, one offers it.
6.3.5.7	For the propagation of offspring.
6.3.5.8	Indeed, Agni is Rudra.
6.3.5.9	The sacrificer is the animal.
6.3.5.10	If one were to kindle fire after offering an animal, one would offer the sacrificer to Rudra. One would be a killer.
6.3.5.11	Some say
6.3.5.12	Agni is all the deities, and this animal is the oblation.
6.3.5.13	When one performs the churning of Agni after having offered the animal.
6.3.5.14	One generates all the deities for the oblation which is near.
6.3.5.15	The churning should be done after having taken up (the materials).
6.3.5.16	It is not offered.
6.3.5.17	It is not not offered.
6.3.5.18	(The Adhvaryu) says, "You are the generator of Agni."
6.3.5.19	He says,
6.3.5.20	Because this is the generator of Agni.
6.3.5.21	"The two testicles are here."
6.3.5.22	He says:
6.3.5.23	"For the two testicles are indeed here."
6.3.5.24	"You are Urvashi."
6.3.5.25	"You have life."
6.3.5.26	He says.
6.3.5.27	For the sake of union.
6.3.5.28	"You should place the testicles anointed with ghee."
6.3.5.29	He says,
6.3.5.30	"For the testicles are indeed placed by those who place the fire."
6.3.5.31	"Be born according to the Gayatri metre."
6.3.5.32	He says,
6.3.5.33-42	He generates him by means of the metres. He says, "Recite to Agni being churned." He recites the Savitri verse. He churns him with the impulse of Savitr. He says "Recite to the born." He says, “Recite to the being carried away." He recitates the Gayatri verse. He makes him prosper in every section. He recites all the Gayatri verses.
6.3.5.43	Agni is the Gayatri metre.
6.3.5.44	He makes him prosper with his own metre.
6.3.5.45	Agni becomes (the fire) before (the Soma-sacrifice). Having churned out Agni, he offers (the Agnihotra).
6.3.5.46	They (Agni and Soma) coming together approach the sacrificer.
6.3.5.47	They say: "May we be of one mind."
6.3.5.48	He says:
6.3.5.49	For peace.
6.3.5.50	Having offered (the Agnihotra) he offers (the Samidheni verses).
6.3.5.51	He bestows food on the born one.
6.3.6.7	The divine clans have gone to the gods.
6.3.6.8	He says:
6.3.6.9	For the divine clans, indeed, have gone to the deities.
6.3.6.10	The fires are the wise ones.
6.3.6.11	He says.
6.3.6.12	The fires, indeed, are the wise ones, the priests.
6.3.6.13	Therefore he says thus.
6.3.6.14	O Brihaspati, with the support, the treasures.
6.3.6.15	He says,
6.3.6.16	Brihaspati is the Brahman of the deities.
6.3.6.17-26	Brahma himself bestows cattle on him. "He says, "May your offerings be pleasing." He says, they indeed become pleasing. "He (the sacrificer) says, "O divine Tvashtra, in the beautiful Vasu." He says, Tvashtra is the creator of the forms of animals and pairs. He indeed places form in animals. "He(the sacrificer)says, "May the Revatis delight." He says,
6.3.6.27-37	The Revatī stars are cattle. He delights cattle for him. "With the impulse of the divine Savitr," he says. He takes up the rope. For propagation. "With (the words) 'With the arms of the Asvins,' he says." He says. For the Asvins were the Adhvaryus of the gods. "With hands of Pūṣan," he says. He says. For protection.
6.3.6.38	"With the noose of the divine oblation, I bind thee with truth."
6.3.6.39	He says.
6.3.6.40	Truth is indeed the truth.
6.3.6.41	He binds him with truth itself.
6.3.6.42	He removes it with the eyes.
6.3.6.43	They release the one who is to be killed facing backwards.
6.3.6.44	For turning away.
6.3.6.45	"He says, "The human beings are to be overcome."
6.3.6.46	He binds.
6.3.6.47	For firmness.
6.3.6.48	"He sprinkles, saying, "I sprinkle thee from the waters and plants."
6.3.6.49-57	He says: "For this animal is born from the plants and water." "He says: 'You are the protector of the waters.' " "He says, 'You are the one who is born from the waters and is dedicated to the sacrifice.' " The divine goddesses, the waters, may they delight in this offering. " He says: 'They indeed delight in it.' He sprinkles from above.
6.3.6.58	He makes him pure from above.
6.3.6.59	He makes him drink.
6.3.6.60	He makes himself pure from within.
6.3.6.61	He sprinkles below.
6.3.6.62	He makes it pure from all sides.
6.3.7.1	The gods conquered the Asuras with Agni as their Hotṛ.
6.3.7.2	He says, "Recite to Agni being kindled."
6.3.7.3	He says.
6.3.7.4	For the conquest of his enemies.
6.3.7.5	He recites seventeen Sāmidhenī verses.
6.3.7.6	Prajapati is seventeenfold.
6.3.7.7	For the attainment of Prajapati.
6.3.7.8	He recites seventeen (verses).
6.3.7.9	Twelve months, five seasons, that is a year.
6.3.7.10	The creatures are born in accordance with the year.
6.3.7.11	For the generation of creatures.
6.3.7.12	The gods, having recited the Sāmidhenīs, did not see the sacrifice.
6.3.7.13	He, Prajapati, offered the oblation silently.
6.3.7.14	Then indeed the gods saw the sacrifice.
6.3.7.15	When he offers the oblation silently,
6.3.7.16	it is for the propagation of the sacrifice.
6.3.7.17	The sacrifice was among the Asuras.
6.3.7.18	The gods won it by silent offering.
6.3.7.19	When he silently offers the oblation,
6.3.7.20	He takes away the sacrifice of his enemy.
6.3.7.21	He smears the enclosing sticks.
6.3.7.22	He purifies them.
6.3.7.23	He smears them three times.
6.3.7.24	The sacrifice is threefold.
6.3.7.25	And also for the removal of the Rākṣasas.
6.3.7.26	They amount to twelve.
6.3.7.27	Twelve months are a year.
6.3.7.28	He pleases the year.
6.3.7.29	Then he places it on the year itself.
6.3.7.30	For the completion of the world of heaven.
6.3.7.31	The offering-spoon is indeed the head of the sacrifice.
6.3.7.32	Agni is all the deities.
6.3.7.33	When he offers the offering-spoon,
6.3.7.34	the sacrificer obtains all the deities at the head of the sacrifiice.
6.3.7.35	The offering spoon is indeed the head, the animal is the body,
6.3.7.36	of the sacrifice.
6.3.7.37	Having sprinkled the animal with the Āghāra water, he anoints it.
6.3.7.38	He places the head of the sacrifice on himself.
6.3.7.39	"He says, "May your breath go with the wind."
6.3.7.40	He says,
6.3.7.41	The breath is indeed connected with the wind-god.
6.3.7.42	He offers his breath to the wind.
6.3.7.43	"He (the sacrificer) says, "May the limbs be united with the Yajatras, may the lord of sacrifice go to the blessing."
6.3.7.44	He says.
6.3.7.45	He makes the lord of sacrifice attain his blessing.
6.3.7.46	Viśvarūpa, the son of Tvaṣṭra, came down upon the animal from above.
6.3.7.47	Therefore they do not injure the animal from above
6.3.7.48	If one anoints the animal from above,
6.3.7.49	One makes it fit for sacrifice.
6.3.7.50	He chooses the priests.
6.3.7.51	He chooses (the priests) who are the metres.
6.3.7.52	He chooses seven (priests).
6.3.7.53	There are seven domestic animals,
6.3.7.54	seven wild animals,
6.3.7.55	seven metres,
6.3.7.56	For the binding of both.
6.3.7.57	One offers eleven Prayāja offerings.
6.3.7.58	There are ten vital breaths in an animal.
6.3.7.59	The self is the eleventh.
6.3.7.60	One offers as much as the animal is.
6.3.7.61	One offers the Vapa offering.
6.3.7.62	One offers oneself to oneself.
6.3.7.63	The Svadhita is indeed a thunderbolt.
6.3.7.64	The Yūpa-shakal is a thunderbolt.
6.3.7.65	The gods, having made ghee into a thunderbolt, struck Soma.
6.3.7.66	"They said, "Anoint the animal with ghee and save it."
6.3.7.67	He says:
6.3.7.68	Having brought him under control with the thunderbolt, one obtains him.
6.3.8.1	One performs the paryāgni.
6.3.8.2	One makes him completely offered.
6.3.8.3	For non-falling.
6.3.8.4	For what falls from the offered, that is indeed falling.
6.3.8.5	One performs paryāgni three times.
6.3.8.6	The sacrifice is repeated three times.
6.3.8.7	And also for the sake of removing the Raksases.
6.3.8.8	Brahmin scholars say:
6.3.8.9	One should not begin with the animals.
6.3.8.10	When an animal is led to death,
6.3.8.11	if one begins with it, the sacrificer would be deprived of life.
6.3.8.12	But some say:
6.3.8.13-20	For when an animal is led away, it is led to the heavenly world. If one does not begin, the sacrificer is deprived of the heavenly world. He begins with the omentum and the ladle. It is neither begun nor not begun. It is not begun, not not begun. "He says, "O Hotr, send forth the offerings to the gods." He says. For the rite is performed with a purpose.
6.3.8.21	"She enters the lord of sacrifice, the beloved."
6.3.8.22	He says.
6.3.8.23	It is indeed as per the Yajus.
6.3.8.24	He goes forward with Agni.
6.3.8.25	For the removal of Rakshas.
6.3.8.26	"Protect the union with the earth."
6.3.8.27	He spreads the sacrificial grass.
6.3.8.28	For non-falling.
6.3.8.29	For what falls on the sacrificial grass does not fall.
6.3.8.30	And he makes him sit on the sacrificial grass.
6.3.8.31	The Adhvaryu turns away from the animal being tied.
6.3.8.32	He thereby makes it his own.
6.3.8.33	For his own safety.
6.3.8.34	He goes to prosperity and obtains cattle, he who knows thus.
6.3.8.35	The animal is led away from the west to the east.
6.3.8.36	He says, "Salutations to the one who is stretched out."
6.3.8.37	He says,
6.3.8.38-48	The rays of the sun are stretched out. He pays homage to them alone. He says, "Go beyond." He says, "The enemy is beyond." For the removal of enemies. He says along the stream of ghee, "Together with offspring, together with the nourishment of wealth." He says. He prays for this blessing. He says "The divine waters are pure."
6.3.8.49	It is as per the Yajurveda.
6.3.9.1	When a cow is caught, its breath goes to the mouth.
6.3.9.2	"Let the speech be nourished."
6.3.9.3	"Let the breath be nourished."
6.3.9.4	He says.
6.3.9.5	He pacifies the impurity of the animal from the breath.
6.3.9.6	It enters the earth from the breath. It is purified.
6.3.9.7	"He says, "May there be peace with the days."
6.3.9.8	He takes it away.
6.3.9.9	By day and night he appeases the impurity of the earth.
6.3.9.10	"He says, "O herb, protect him, O well-established one, do not harm him."
6.3.9.11	He says.
6.3.9.12	The well-established one is Varja.
6.3.9.13	For appeasement.
6.3.9.14	He puts it on the side.
6.3.9.15	Because humans put it on the middle.
6.3.9.16	He puts on the edge.
6.3.9.17	Because humans cover it from the back.
6.3.9.18	For the exclusion.
6.3.9.19	"You are the share of the Rakshasas."
6.3.9.20	Having placed the grass of the elder one, he throws it away.
6.3.9.21	He repels the Rakshasas with oil.
6.3.9.22	"This is the lowest darkness, I lead the Rakshasa who hates us and whom we hate."
6.3.9.23	He says:
6.3.9.24	There are indeed two persons, the one who hates and the one who is hated.
6.3.9.25	Both of them lead to the lowest darkness.
6.3.9.26	"Obeisance to thee, O Agni, Obeisance to thee."
6.3.9.27	He digs out the Vapa.
6.3.9.28	For he who sacrifices is indeed like one who desires.
6.3.9.29	If he were to dig it up, Rudra would be the slayer of his cattle.
6.3.9.30	If he does not dig it up, it would be crooked.
6.3.9.31	He cuts with another (knife).
6.3.9.32	With another he does not.
6.3.9.33	For firmness.
6.3.9.34	"He anoints the heaven and earth with ghee, saying, 'You are heaven and earth.'
6.3.9.35	He says,
6.3.9.36	He anoints heaven and earth with the juice.
6.3.9.37	'Unbroken is the wealth of good heroes,'
6.3.9.38	He says, as per the prescribed procedure.
6.3.9.39	This is as per the prescribed ritual.
6.3.9.40	What he does by cutting out the omentum is indeed cruel.
6.3.9.41	"O Urva, follow the sky."
6.3.9.42	He says:
6.3.9.43	For peace.
6.3.9.44	Indeed, he who follows the animal being led to death, falls away from this world.
6.3.9.45	One follows again with the omentum and the ladle.
6.3.9.46	One stands firm in this very world.
6.3.9.47	One goes forward with Agni.
6.3.9.48	For the removal of the Rākṣasas.
6.3.9.49	Then indeed he follows the deities with the oblation.
6.3.9.50	One should not carry the embers beyond the limit.
6.3.9.51	If one were to carry the embers beyond (the limit), the deities would be angry.
6.3.9.52	(One says) "O Vayu, do thou blow away the embers."
6.3.9.53	(One says), "Do thou blow away the small ones."
6.3.9.54	Therefore the small ones fall down separately.
6.3.9.55	The grass is the best of animals, the best of plants.
6.3.9.56	He offers the foremost with the foremost.
6.3.9.57	He thus establishes the animals in the plants.
6.3.9.58	"He says, "To those who have offered with Svāhā."
6.3.9.59	He says,
6.3.9.60	For the completion of the sacrifice.
6.3.9.61	The clarified butter and the fat are the life-breath and out-breath of animals.
6.3.9.62	The fat is the self.
6.3.9.63	Having poured clarified butter over the fat, he pours it over the clarified butter.
6.3.9.64	He places the Prāṇa and Apāna in the self of the animals.
6.3.9.65	"He says, "Obeisance to the wind in the upper sky."
6.3.9.66	He says,
6.3.9.67	"The wind in the upper firmament is the offering-spoon of the gods."
6.3.9.68	He strikes with that alone.
6.3.9.69	He strikes with a straight line.
6.3.9.70	Therefore Prāṇa and Āpāna are in the upper firmament.
6.3.10.1	Having offered the animal, he offers the cake.
6.3.10.2	He offers it to the same deity.
6.3.10.3	Having performed with the oblation, he performs with the cake.
6.3.10.4	The cake is indeed nourishment.
6.3.10.5	He places nourishment in the middle of the animals.
6.3.10.6	And also he closes the gap of the animal.
6.3.10.7	Having offered the clarified butter, he asks three times, "Is the oblation cooked? Is it well-cooked?"
6.3.10.8	The gods are three times three.
6.3.10.9	He who says what is not cooked is cooked, he is guilty.
6.3.10.10	The two breaths, the Prāṇāpāna, are the Pṛṣadājya of animals.
6.3.10.11	When an animal is killed, the heart is the soul that unites with the self.
6.3.10.12	When one anoints the heart with Pṛṣadājy,
6.3.10.13	he places the Prāṇās and Apānās of animals in the self.
6.3.10.14	The gods went to heaven by means of the animal.
6.3.10.15	They thought:
6.3.10.16	"Men will follow us."
6.3.10.17	Having cut off its head, they spread out its brain. It became a stream.
6.3.10.18	That is why it is called a stream.
6.3.10.19	When the grass is from the Plakṣa tree and is placed on the northern side,
6.3.10.20	it is for the animal that has the same brain.
6.3.10.21	The Rākṣasas follow the animal being led away.
6.3.10.22	He carries it between the sacrificial post and the Āhavanīya fire.
6.3.10.23	For the removal of the Rākṣasas.
6.3.10.24	The mind of the animal that has been caught escapes.
6.3.10.25	He says, "Recite when the oblation for Manotā is being offered."
6.3.10.26	He says.
6.3.10.27	He indeed wins back his mind.
6.3.10.28	He offers eleven oblations.
6.3.10.29	There are ten breaths of the animal.
6.3.10.30	The self is the eleventh.
6.3.10.31	He cuts out as much as the animal is.
6.3.10.32	He cuts from the heart first, then from the tongue, then from the chest.
6.3.10.33	What one approaches with the heart, one speaks with the tongue.
6.3.10.34	What one speaks with the mouth, one utters above the chest.
6.3.10.35	This is the order of the animal.
6.3.10.36	He who thus offers the oblation as he pleases, and then offers the oblations of the others in the same order as before, his oblation is offered.
6.3.10.37	He offers the oblation in the middle of the anus.
6.3.10.38	For the breath is in the middle.
6.3.10.39	He offers it in the upper part.
6.3.10.40	For the upper part is the breath.
6.3.10.41	If one offers either the other or both, it is a sacrifice.
6.3.10.42	When a Brāhmaṇa is born, he is born with three debts: to the Rṣis through Vedic study, to the gods through sacrifice, and to the ancestors through progeny.
6.3.10.43	He who has a son, performs sacrifices, and observes celibacy is debt-free.
6.3.10.44	He repays them through oblations.
6.3.10.45	This is the reason for the oblations.
6.3.10.46	The gods and the demons were engaged in a battle.
6.3.10.47	The gods said to Agni,
6.3.10.48	"With you as our hero, we shall overcome the Asuras."
6.3.10.49	He said,
6.3.10.50	"Choose a boon."
6.3.10.51	"Release the animal from the stake."
6.3.10.52	He released the animal from the post, the hindquarters from the front, the anus from the middle, and the hips from the hindquarters.
6.3.10.53	Then the gods became victorious,
6.3.10.54	the Asuras were defeated.
6.3.10.55	When one divides the three-limbed (animal),
6.3.11.4	Having taken up the ghee, he pours it down.
6.3.11.5	This is the essence of animals, namely, fat.
6.3.11.6	He places the essence in the animals.
6.3.11.7	He offers the fat-offering on the side.
6.3.11.8	The side is the middle of animals.
6.3.11.9	This is their essence, namely, fat,
6.3.11.10	When he offers the fat- offering on the side,
6.3.11.11	He places the essence of the animals in the middle itself.
6.3.11.12	They kill the animal when they bind it.
6.3.11.13	The breath is indeed Indra as the deity.
6.3.11.14	The out-breath is Indra.
6.3.11.15	The breath should be placed in each part of the body.
6.3.11.16	He says.
6.3.11.17	He places the in-breath and out-breath in the animals.
6.3.11.18	"O divine Tvashtar, may thy abundance be with us."
6.3.11.19	He says.
6.3.11.20	For the animals are under the deity Tvashtri.
6.3.11.21	"They become of various forms and with various marks."
6.3.11.22	He says.
6.3.11.23	"For they are indeed of various forms and now they become of various marks."
6.3.11.24	"May your friends follow you, O god, as you go; may your mother and father rejoice."
6.3.11.25	He says,
6.3.11.26	He sends him to heaven, approved by his mother and father.
6.3.11.27-34	He offers the Vasahomas at half the time. This is the half-time. This is half-time. He anoints them with juice. He offers to the directions. He anoints the directions with juice. And he indeed obtains the juice and strength from the directions. The fresh butter is indeed the life-breath and out-breath of animals.
6.3.11.35	The animals are indeed the deity of the trees.
6.3.11.36	When he offers the clarified butter, he says:
6.3.11.37	"Recite for Vanaspati."
6.3.11.38	"Recite to Vanaspati." He says.
6.3.11.39	He places the vital breaths and the out-breaths in the animals.
6.3.11.40	He cuts off the equal share of one from the other.
6.3.11.41	Therefore, the animals have different forms.
6.3.11.42	He sprinkles the hot (clarified butter).
6.3.11.43	This is the essence of cattle, namely, the Yūṣa.
6.3.11.44	He places the essence in the cattle.
6.3.11.45	He calls out to Ida.
6.3.11.46	Ida is cattle.
6.3.11.47	He is calling out to cattle.
6.3.11.48	He makes four calls.
6.3.11.49	Cattle have four feet.
6.3.11.50	If one desires:
6.3.11.51	He should become without cattle.
6.3.11.52	One should place it without fat.
6.3.11.53	Cattle are of the form of fat.
6.3.11.54	He separates him from the animals by means of form.
6.3.11.55	He becomes without animals.
6.3.11.56	If one desires:
6.3.11.57	"He should be with animals."
6.3.11.58	One should place it with fat.
6.3.11.59	Animals are of the form of fat.
6.3.11.60	He wins animals for him by means of form alone.
6.3.11.61	He becomes with animals.
6.3.11.62	Prajapati created the sacrifice.
6.3.11.63	He created ghee in front.
6.3.11.64-73	The animal is in the middle. Clarified butter is at the back. Therefore, the Prayāja offerings are made with clarified butter. The animal is in the center. The Anuyāja offerings are made of clarified butter. Therefore, this is like a mixture. Because it was created at the back. The Anuyāja offerings are made of clarified butter, One offers eleven Anuyāja offerings. There are ten breaths in an animal, and the self is the eleventh.
6.3.11.74	He offers the Anuyājas in accordance with the size of the animal.
6.3.11.75	When they bind the animal, they kill it.
6.3.11.76	The animal's life and out-breath are the clarified butter.
6.3.11.77	When one offers the Anuyajas with clarified butter,
6.3.11.78	one places the life and out- breath in the animal.
6.4.1.1	Prajapati created beings by means of the sacrifice.
6.4.1.2	They created them with the Upāyas.
6.4.1.3	When one offers with the Upāyās, the sacrificer creates offspring.
6.4.1.4	He offers from the middle of the buttocks.
6.4.1.5	For from the middle of buttocks offspring are born.
6.4.1.6	He offers (the oblation) from the elder (part).
6.4.1.7	For from the elder (person) offspring are born. He offers without breaking (the oblation).
6.4.1.8	For the non-breaking of the vital airs.
6.4.1.9	He does not turn around.
6.4.1.10	If he were to turn it around, there would be a reversal, and the offspring would be seized.
6.4.1.11	He says, "Go to the ocean, svāhā."
6.4.1.12	He places the semen there.
6.4.1.13	He says "Go to the atmosphere, svāhā".
6.4.1.14	He generates offspring for him with the atmosphere.
6.4.1.15	For offspring are born following the atmosphere.
6.4.1.16	He says “Go to the god Savitar, svāhā”.
6.4.1.17	He makes him generate offspring for him, as it were, by Savitr.
6.4.1.18	He says, "Go to the day and night, svāhā."
6.4.1.19	He makes him generate offspring, as it were by the day and night.
6.4.1.20	For offspring are born in accordance with the day and night;
6.4.1.21	He says, “Go to Mitra-Varuna, svāhā.”
6.4.1.22	He places the vital breaths and out-breaths in the offspring that have been generated.
6.4.1.23	"Go to Soma! Svāhā!" he says.
6.4.1.24	For the gods are indeed Soma.
6.4.1.25	"Go to the sacrifice! Svāhā!” he says.
6.4.1.26	He makes the offspring fit for sacrifice.
6.4.1.27	"Go the metres! Svāhā!" he says.
6.4.1.28	The metres are indeed cattle.
6.4.1.29	He indeed wins cattle.
6.4.1.30	"Go, O Heaven and Earth! Svāhā!“ he says.
6.4.1.31	The offspring, indeed, are born from the heaven and earth. He takes them in from both sides.
6.4.1.32	He says, "May I go to the sky of heaven, svāhā."
6.4.1.33	He causes rain to fall on the offspring that are born.
6.4.1.34	He says "May I go unto Agni Vaisvānara, svāhā".
6.4.1.35	He establishes the offspring that are already born in this (earth).
6.4.1.36	The one who cuts the throat cuts the life-force of the animals.
6.4.1.37	He says, "May my mind be in my heart."
6.4.1.38	He summons the life-forces back to their proper places.
6.4.1.39	When an animal is killed, the heart is afflicted by the heat.
6.4.1.40	It leads to heart pain.
6.4.1.41	If one were to remove heart pain from the earth, one would afflict the earth with impurity.
6.4.2.3	That is the reason for the name Vasatīvarī.
6.4.2.4	In that they were not able to do it in the morning.
6.4.2.5	They put it in the water.
6.4.2.6	They became Vasatīvarīs.
6.4.2.7	One takes the Vasatīvaris.
6.4.2.8	The Vasatīvarıs are indeed the sacrifice.
6.4.2.9	Having taken them up, one observes the fast, beginning with the sacrifice.
6.4.2.10	If one were to take it without being grasped, his sacrifice would be interrupted and he would be cut off from the sacrifice.
6.4.2.11	One should take it from a lamp or a golden vessel.
6.4.2.12	One takes it from the bright ones.
6.4.2.13	One should obtain it from a brahmin who performs many sacrifices.
6.4.2.14	He is the one who has taken the Vasatīvari water.
6.4.2.15	He takes the Vasatīvarī waters.
6.4.2.16	The Vasatīvarīs are cattle.
6.4.2.17	Having taken them, he observes the fast with cattle in view.
6.4.2.18	If he were to take them standing in the opposite direction, cattle would be excluded from him.
6.4.2.19	He takes them standing in the right direction.
6.4.2.20	He takes cattle for him by excluding them.
6.4.2.21	Indra killed Vritra.
6.4.2.22	He was drowned in the waters.
6.4.2.23	Of those waters, that which was pure, fit for sacrifice, and divine, that he released.
6.4.2.24	They became the flowing ones.
6.4.2.25	One takes the flowing ones. The flowing ones are the waters.
6.4.2.26	One takes those waters which are pure, fit for the sacrifice, and divine.
6.4.2.27	One should not go beyond the flowing ones.
6.4.2.28-33	He should not take water from a standing vessel. Standing vessels are held by Varuna. If he were to take water from a vessel standing still, Varuna would seize his sacrifice. What happens during the day, the waters enter at night. Therefore, one sees the waters as red during the day.
6.4.2.34	What is night, the waters enter during the day.
6.4.2.35	And from that the waters are seen at night.
6.4.2.36	He takes at the junction of shadow and sunlight.
6.4.2.37	He takes the color of day and night.
6.4.2.38	He says, "These waters are full of oblations."
6.4.2.39	He takes (them) from those who have made oblations.
6.4.2.40	"May the Sun be the most generous one," he says.
6.4.2.41	He takes (Soma) from the bright ones.
6.4.2.42	He takes it with the Anushtubh verse.
6.4.2.43	The Anushtubh is speech.
6.4.2.44	He takes them with all speech.
6.4.2.45	He (takes Soma) with a four-footed verse.
6.4.2.46	He presses it thrice.
6.4.2.47	Seven are completed.
6.4.2.48	The Sakvari has seven steps.
6.4.2.49	The Sakvarī is cattle.
6.4.2.50-55	He indeed wins cattle. The Garhapatya is set up for this world, the Ahavaniya for the other world. If one were to place it in the Garhapatya, one would have cattle in this world. If in the Ahavaniya, one would be having cattle in the other world. One places it in both. One makes him having cattle in both worlds.
6.4.2.56	It wards off from all sides, for the destruction of the Rakshas.
6.4.2.57	He says, "You are the share of Indra and Agni."
6.4.2.58	It is indeed as the Yajus.
6.4.2.59	The Agnidhra makes them fast.
6.4.2.60	This indeed is the invincible part of the sacrifice, namely the Agnidhra.
6.4.2.61	He makes them fast that very invincible part of the sacrificie.
6.4.2.62	For when the sacrifice is spread out, it is not performed, then the demons roam around the sacrifice.
6.4.2.63	When one takes from the flowing (Soma), it is as if the sacrifice is being performed, for the demons not to roam around.
6.4.2.64	For they do not perform it.
6.4.2.65	They go around until the third pressing, for the continuity of the sacrifice.
6.4.3.1	The Brahmanas say, "The Adhvaryu who offers Soma to all the deities should offer it to all the deities."
6.4.3.2	He says, "To the heart of thee."
6.4.3.3	He does this for the sake of men.
6.4.3.4	He says, “To the mind of thee.”
6.4.3.5	He does this to the Pitrs.
6.4.3.6	He says "To the heaven of thee, to the sun of thee."
6.4.3.7	He does this for the gods alone.
6.4.3.8	These are the only deities.
6.4.3.9	He thus takes him to all of them.
6.4.3.10	He recites the morning recitation before the speech is uttered.
6.4.3.11	He thus obtains as much as the speech.
6.4.3.12	He utters the water first.
6.4.3.13	The sacrifice is the waters.
6.4.3.14	He thus releases the speech towards the sacrifice.
6.4.3.15	He recites all the metres.
6.4.3.16	The metres are indeed cattle.
6.4.3.17	He indeed wins cattle.
6.4.3.18	One should place the Gayatri for one who desires brilliance, the Tristubh for one who desires strength, the Jagati for one who desires cattle, the Anushtubh for one who wishes stability, the Pankti for one who desires sacrifice, the Viraj for one who desires food.
6.4.3.19	"May Agni listen to the invocation with the kindling wood."
6.4.3.20	Having offered to the deities, he says, "The waters are pure."
6.4.3.21	He says, "The desire is accomplished, O Hotṛ."
6.4.3.22	For the desired rite is performed.
6.4.3.23	He says, "The Maitrāvaruṇa's cup is flowing."
6.4.3.24	Maitrāvaruṇa are the leaders of the waters.
6.4.3.25	He offers them to them.
6.4.3.26	He says "The divine waters, the feet of the waters."
6.4.3.27	He takes it with the offering itself.
6.4.3.28	He takes it from those who have prepared the oblation.
6.4.3.29	He says, "You are a gift."
6.4.3.30	He thus covers their blemish.
6.4.3.31	He says "From the inexhaustible ocean you are taken."
6.4.3.32	Therefore the waters that are drunk and used do not get exhausted.
6.4.3.33	The sacrificial post is the womb of the sacrifice.
6.4.3.34	The Vāsativarī waters are the sacrifice.
6.4.3.35	Having touched the Hotr and Maitrāvaruṇa cups, he carries the Vāsativarīs.
6.4.3.36	For the sacrifice to have a womb.
6.4.3.37	And also he generates them from their own womb.
6.4.3.38	He says, "O Adhvaryu, bring the waters."
6.4.3.39	"He says, 'Do you see the one who is not seen and the one who is seen.'
6.4.3.40	If it is an Agniṣṭoma, he offers.
6.4.3.41	If it is a Ukthya, he smears the Paridhi.
6.4.3.42	If it an Atiratra, he approaches reciting the Yajus for the exclusion of the Yajnakratus.
6.4.4.1	'In the impulse of the divine Savitr,' he takes up the stone for pressing, for the impulse.
6.4.4.2	He says, "With the arms of the Ashvins."
6.4.4.3	For the Ashvins were the Adhvaryus of the gods.
6.4.4.4	He says, "With Pusan's hands," for the sake of the Yati.
6.4.4.5	Soma is indeed cattle.
6.4.4.6	Vyana is the Upamshu-savan.
6.4.4.7	When he moulds the Upamshu savan,
6.4.4.8	he places Vyana among the cattle.
6.4.4.9	He moulds, saying, "For Indra, for Indra."
6.4.4.10	Soma is offered to Indra.
6.4.4.11	One measures five times with the Yajus.
6.4.4.12	The Pankti has five syllables.
6.4.4.13	The sacrifice is fivefold.
6.4.4.14	One indeed attains the sacrifice.
6.4.4.15	Five times silently.
6.4.4.16	Ten are completed.
6.4.4.17	The Viraj has ten syllables.
6.4.4.18	Food is Viraj.
6.4.4.19	One indeed obtains food by means of Viraj.
6.4.4.20-26	"O ye who are the guardians of the cattle, O ye who are the destroyers of Vritra," he says. This indeed is the Soma-drink of the waters. He who knows thus does not meet with calamity in the waters. "The light which is thine in heaven," he says. This indeed is the Soma drink of the waters. He who knows thus does not meet with calamity in the waters. "That which is thine in the heaven," he says; he thus gathers him from these worlds. Soma indeed, the king, looked towards the directions. He entered the directions.
6.4.4.27	He says, "In front, behind, above, below."
6.4.4.28	He collects him from the directions.
6.4.4.29	He indeed secures him in the directions.
6.4.4.30	"O Amba, do not be angry," he says.
6.4.4.31	Women desire him who knows thus.
6.4.4.32	"What is your name, O Soma, that you are awake?" he says.
6.4.4.33	This indeed is Soma's drinking of Soma.
6.4.4.34	He who knows thus does not suffer from misfortune.
6.4.4.35	They indeed kill Soma when they press it.
6.4.4.36	He takes up the Soma-stalks.
6.4.4.37	He indeed saves it.
6.4.4.38	The Soma-stalks are the vital airs.
6.4.4.39	Soma is the cattle.
6.4.4.40	He again puts the Soma-stalk.
6.4.4.41	He indeed places the vital airs in the cattle.
6.4.4.42	Twice he puts (the Soma-stalks).
6.4.4.43	Therefore, two and two are the Prāṇas.
6.4.5.1	This is indeed the Prāṇa, which is Upāṃśu.
6.4.5.2	When the Upāṃśus are taken, they proceed along the Prāṇa.
6.4.5.3	Arunaupaveśi said:
6.4.5.4	I will establish the sacrifice at the morning pressing.
6.4.5.5	With that established, I will proceed.
6.4.5.6	He takes it eight times in the beginning.
6.4.5.7-15	The Gayatri has eight syllables. The morning pressing is in the Gayatri metre. One attains the morning pressing by it. One recites the second pressing eleven times. The Tristubh has eleven syllables. The midday pressing is in the Tristubh metre. One obtains the midday pressing by it. The third pressing is recited twelve times. The Jagati has twelve syllables.
6.4.5.16-21	The Jāgata is the third pressing. By it one attains the third pressing. This indeed is the stability of the sacrifice, which he told to Skanda. For what falls from the stable sacrifice is indeed what falls. But they also say that the Gāyatrī is indeed the morning pressing. He whose enemy knows this becomes one who does not exceed the bounds.
6.4.5.22	Therefore, having divided it into eight parts, one should offer the oblation.
6.4.5.23	Brahmin scholars say:
6.4.5.24	Other Grahas are taken with Pavitras.
6.4.5.25	What is the Pavitra of Upāṃśu?
6.4.5.26	One should say, "Speech is the Pavitra."
6.4.5.27	He says, "O Vājini, flow for the lord of speech."
6.4.5.28	He purifies him with speech.
6.4.5.29	He says, "With the shoulders of Vṛṣa."
6.4.5.30	For these are the shoulders of Vrsna, the Soma.
6.4.5.31	He says, "Purified by the rays."
6.4.5.32	For he purifies it by the rays.
6.4.5.33	He says "You are the divine purifier of the gods."
6.4.5.34	For he is the divine purifier of gods.
6.4.5.35	He says to whom he belongs, "To those for whom you are a share."
6.4.5.36	For those to whom this is a share, he takes it for them.
6.4.5.37	He says, "You are taken for yourself."
6.4.5.38	He makes the breath his own.
6.4.5.39	He says "Make the honeyed rays yours."
6.4.5.40	He makes everything here taste good for him.
6.4.5.41	He says (to the sacrificer), "For all the divine and earthly senses."
6.4.5.42	He gives life to both gods and men.
6.4.5.43	He says, "May your mind be satisfied."
6.4.5.44	He indeed satisfies the mind.
6.4.5.45	He says "May you follow the heaven."
6.4.5.46	The breath is indeed connected with the heaven.
6.4.5.47	He says: "May you be satisfied with the sun."
6.4.5.48	The gods are indeed satisfied with the breath.
6.4.5.49	He offers the oblation in them.
6.4.5.50	"To the gods, to the rays of the sun," he says.
6.4.5.51	The rays of the sun are the gods, the rays.
6.4.5.52	That is their share.
6.4.5.53	He thus pleases them.
6.4.5.54	If one wishes, "May the rain be plentiful," one should rub with the hand downwards.
6.4.5.55	One restrains the rain.
6.4.5.56	If he wishes for rain, he should rub with the outstretched (hand).
6.4.5.57	He indeed seeks rain.
6.4.5.58	If he wants to curse someone, he should say: "I will curse you, but first I will offer a sacrifice."
6.4.5.59	He indeed kills him by offering a sacrifice.
6.4.5.60	If he is far away, he should stand facing him.
6.4.5.61	He indeed kills by following his breath.
6.4.5.62	If he were to perform the rite, he should perform it with the words, "I place thee in the breath of so-and-so."
6.4.5.63	Breath is indeed a settled (state).
6.4.5.64	He settles his breath.
6.4.5.65	He purifies with six rays.
6.4.5.66	There are six seasons.
6.4.5.67	He puricfies him with the seasons.
6.4.5.68	He purities three times.
6.4.5.69	These are the three worlds.
6.4.5.70	He purifics him with these worlds.
6.4.5.71	The Brahmanas say, "Why are the three animals (mentioned) as being taken by the hand?"
6.4.5.72	Because he takes them three times by the hand, therefore the three animals are taken by the hand, viz. man, elephant and monkey.
6.4.6.1	The gods did what the Asuras did at the sacrifice.
6.4.6.2	The gods saw that the sacrifice was to be established in the Upamsu.
6.4.6.3	They placed him in the Upāṁśu.
6.4.6.4	The Asuras, having raised the thunderbolt, attacked the gods.
6.4.6.5	The gods, being afraid, ran to Indra.
6.4.6.6	Indra hid them with the Antaryama.
6.4.6.7	That is why the Antaryama is called Antaryama.
6.4.6.8	When the Antaryama is taken, the sacrificer hides his enemies.
6.4.6.9	I place you within the heaven and earth, within the expanse of the earth, within the sky. So he says.
6.4.6.10	By means of these worlds the sacrificer puts his enemies to sleep.
6.4.6.11	The gods thought: Indra was this, that we are.
6.4.6.12	They said: O Maghavan, do not share with us.
6.4.6.13	He said, "Together with the lower and higher gods."
6.4.6.14	He shared them both, the higher and lower gods.
6.4.6.15	He said, "Together..."
6.4.6.16	He shares them both, the lower and higher...
6.4.6.17	"O Maghavan, enjoy the secret sacrifice," he says.
6.4.6.18	The sacrificer does not go beyond the sacrifice.
6.4.6.19	He says, "You are taken with a view to offering," for the sake of holding the offering.
6.4.6.20	If both were to be taken without being purified, the out-breath would follow the in-breath, and he would die.
6.4.6.21	The Antar-yama is taken with a purifying cloth, for the sake of maintaining the in-breath and out-breath.
6.4.6.22	The Upavasatha and Antaryama are indeed the Prāṇa and Apāna.
6.4.6.23	Vyāna is the Upavasatha Soma.
6.4.6.24	If one desires of a person, 'May he die', one should place them (the Soma-cups) without touching (each other).
6.4.6.25	He severs his Prāṇa and Āpāna by means of Vyāna.
6.4.6.26	He dies quickly.
6.4.6.27	If one wishes of a person, ‘May he live the full span of life', one should place (the cups) touching (each other)
6.4.6.28	By means of the Vyana alone he connects his Prāṇa and Apāna.
6.4.6.29	He attains the whole life.
6.4.7.1	This is indeed speech, namely the Indra-Vayu (cup).
6.4.7.2	When the cups beginning with Indra-Vayu are taken, they follow speech.
6.4.7.3	The gods said to Vayu, "Kill King Soma."
6.4.7.4	He said,
6.4.7.5	"I choose a boon.
6.4.7.6	The Grahas are indeed the Grahas of Indra and Vayu.
6.4.7.7	Therefore the Grahas are taken beginning with Indra and Vayu,
6.4.7.8	They killed him.
6.4.7.9	He became impure.
6.4.7.10	The gods did not touch him.
6.4.7.11	They said to Vayu, "Let him be agreeable to us."
6.4.7.12	He said,
6.4.7.13	"I choose a boon.
6.4.7.14	Your vessels are dedicated to my deity, the wind.
6.4.7.15	Therefore, there are vessels dedicated to different deities, but they are called "wind-vessels."
6.4.7.16	From them, the wind itself enjoyed.
6.4.7.17	Therefore, when it is purified, it is eaten in the wind.
6.4.7.18	Because the wind is its purifier and enjoyer.
6.4.7.19	They did not find its separation.
6.4.7.20	Sādati said:
6.4.7.21	Choose a boon.
6.4.7.22	Then I will give you.
6.4.7.23	You are the Soma-offerings of my deity.
6.4.7.24	He says, "You are taken with the offering."
6.4.7.25	They are dedicated to Aditi.
6.4.7.26	Those that are made of wood are born from her womb.
6.4.7.27	Those that made of clay are directly hers.
6.4.7.28	Therefore he says this.
6.4.7.29	Speech, indeed, is the highest, and it spoke in an unmanifest manner.
6.4.7.30	Those gods said to Indra,
6.4.7.31	"Pronounce this speech of ours."
6.4.7.32	He said,
6.4.7.33	"I choose a boon."
6.4.7.34	"This (speech) should be taken by me and Vayu together."
6.4.7.35	Therefore the Indra-Vayu cup is taken together.
6.4.7.36	Indra, having stepped in the middle, declared it.
6.4.7.37	Therefore this speech, being declared, is raised.
6.4.7.38	Therefore it is taken once for Indra in the middle, twice for Vayu.
6.4.7.39	For he chose two boons.
6.4.8.1	The gods said to Mitra, "Let us kill King Soma."
6.4.8.2	He said, "I am not the friend of all."
6.4.8.3	They said, "We shall kill him."
6.4.8.4	He said,
6.4.8.5	"Choose a boon."
6.4.8.6	"May you pour Soma for me with milk."
6.4.8.7	Therefore they pour Soma for Maitrāvaruṇa with milk.
6.4.8.8	Therefore cattle fled.
6.4.8.9	"Having been friendly, he did a cruel act."
6.4.8.10	Indeed, he who sacrifices with Soma does a cruel act.
6.4.8.11	Therefore the cattle go away.
6.4.8.12	When he offers the Maitrāvaruṇa cup with milk, he thereby prospers the cattle and the sacrificer with cattle.
6.4.8.13	Formerly indeed Mitra knew this:
6.4.8.14	"The cattle will go away from my wrathful deed."
6.4.8.15	Therefore he chose this:
6.4.8.16	The gods said to Varuna:
6.4.8.17	"You should kill King Soma with your share."
6.4.8.18	He said,
6.4.8.19	"Choose a boon."
6.4.8.20	"He said, 'May he be taken together with me and Mitra.'
6.4.8.21	Therefore, Mitra-Varuna is taken together.
6.4.8.22	Therefore, kings kill kings with their shares, vaishyas with vaishyas, and shudras with shudras.
6.4.8.23	It was neither day nor night, it was not distinguished.
6.4.8.24	Those gods said to Mitra-Varuna, "Distribute this for us."
6.4.8.25	They said,
6.4.8.26	"We choose a boon.
6.4.8.27	One alone should be taken first."
6.4.8.28	Therefore the Indra-Vayu is taken first from the Mitra-Varuna.
6.4.8.29	For the Prāṇāpāna are indeed the Upāṃśu and Antar-yāma.
6.4.8.30	Mitra generated the day, Varuna the night.
6.4.8.31	Then this (world) became separated.
6.4.8.32	When the Maitrāvaruṇa (priest) is appointed, it is for separation.
6.4.9.1	The head of the sacrifice was cut off.
6.4.9.2	The gods said to the Asvins,
6.4.9.3	"You are indeed physicians.
6.4.9.4	This is the head of the sacrifice, it is restored."
6.4.9.5	They said:
6.4.9.6	"We choose a boon."
6.4.9.7	"Let us be taken here by the Graha."
6.4.9.8	They took this Asvin (graha) from them.
6.4.9.9	Then they restored the head of the sacrificial rite.
6.4.9.10	When the Asvin (grama) is taken, it is for the completion of the sacrifice.
6.4.9.11	The gods said, "These two men are not pure, they are physicians."
6.4.9.12	Therefore a Brahman should not practice medicine.
6.4.9.13	For the physician is impure and unclean.
6.4.9.14	Having purified them with the Bahispavamāna (hymn), they took this Asvina from them.
6.4.9.15	Therefore, in the Bahispavamāna, the Asvin is taken up.
6.4.9.16	Therefore, one who knows this should perform the Bahispavamaana.
6.4.9.17	The Bahispavamaan is indeed a purifier.
6.4.9.18	One purifies oneself.
6.4.9.19	They placed the medicine in three ways: one-third in the fire, one-third in water, and one-third in a brahmana.
6.4.9.20	Therefore, having placed a water pot, and having seated the Brahman to the right, one should perform the remedy.
6.4.9.21	As long as one performs the remedy, it is considered to be done.
6.4.9.22	Brahmin scholars say: Why are the two-deity pots taken from the truth and the two-deities are offered?
6.4.9.23	Because they are taken in one vessel, therefore the Prāṇa is one within.
6.4.9.24	Two vessels are offered.
6.4.9.25	Therefore the Prāṇas are two by two outside.
6.4.9.26	The Dvidevatyās are indeed the Prāṇās.
6.4.9.27	The Idā is the cattle.
6.4.9.28	If one were to invoke the Idā first among the Dvidevatyā, one would place the Prāṇā within the cattle and would be a killer.
6.4.9.29	Having eaten the oblations of two deities, he invites the Ida.
6.4.9.30	Having placed the vital airs in himself, he invites the animals.
6.4.9.31	The Indra-Vayu oblation is speech.
6.4.9.32	The Maitra-Varuna oblation is sight.
6.4.9.33	The Asvin oblation is hearing.
6.4.9.34	He eats the Indra-Vayu offering first.
6.4.9.35	Therefore one speaks with speech first, and sees with sight first.
6.4.9.36	Therefore he sees with the eye in front.
6.4.9.37	The Aśvinis are to be placed all around.
6.4.9.38	Therefore one hears with the ear all around.
6.4.9.39	The two-deity offerings are indeed the vital airs.
6.4.9.40	He places the vessels without being empty.
6.4.9.41	Therefore the vital airs are not empty within.
6.4.9.42	Whatever is not done at a well-spread out sacrifice, the demons roam around that part of the sacrifice.
6.4.9.43	When he places the vessels which are not empty, then the sacrifice lies down, for the purpose of not being shared by the Rākṣasas.
6.4.9.44	He places them on the northern side of the southern Havirdhāna.
6.4.9.45	He places speech in speech.
6.4.9.46	They go around until the third pressing, for the continuity of the sacrifice.
6.4.10.1	Brihaspati was the priest of the gods, and Śaṇḍa and Marīci were the priests of the Asuras.
6.4.10.2	The gods and the Asuras were equal in power.
6.4.10.3	They were not able to overcome each other.
6.4.10.4	The gods invited Sandamarka.
6.4.10.5	They said:
6.4.10.6	"We choose a boon."
6.4.10.7	"Only the Grahas should not be taken here."
6.4.10.8	The gods took them from them.
6.4.10.9	Then the gods became victorious, the Asuras were defeated.
6.4.10.10	For him who knows thus, when the Soma and the clarified butter are taken, he becomes victorious, his foe is defeated.
6.4.10.11	The gods offered them to Indra after having driven them away.
6.4.10.12	One should say, "The eunuch and the hermaphrodite have been driven away along with the sage," to whomsoever one hates.
6.4.10.13	He who hates them, he drives them away together with him.
6.4.10.14	The first one, Samkriti, they offered to themselves as Indra and Visvakarman.
6.4.10.15	Indra indeed performed these forms.
6.4.10.16	The bright one is indeed the sun.
6.4.10.17	The pale one is the moon.
6.4.10.18	They come out facing east, having taken hold of each other.
6.4.10.19	Therefore, those who go forward do not see.
6.4.10.20	They offer, turning back.
6.4.10.21	Therefore, those who go backward see.
6.4.10.22	The Sukra and Manthin are the eyes of the sacrifice.
6.4.10.23	The Uttaravedi is the nose.
6.4.10.24	They offer after going around on all sides.
6.4.10.25	Therefore, the eyes are on both sides of the nose.
6.4.10.26	Therefore, the eyes are held by the nose.
6.4.10.27	For the destruction of the demons who roam everywhere.
6.4.10.28	The gods offered oblations to the east, and those who were Asuras in the east, they repelled them with those (oblations).
6.4.10.29	Those who were Asuras behind, they repelled them (with oblations) to the west.
6.4.10.30-33	The oblations are offered in the east, the two (oblations) of Sukra and Manthin are offered in the west. The sacrificer drives away his enemies from behind and from the front. Therefore offspring are born in the east and are born in the west. The offspring are born following Sukra and Manthina, the eaters and the first ones.
6.4.10.34	May you go forth, generating offspring, with the bright light of the bright ones.
6.4.10.35	May you go forth, with the bright offspring, generating offspring, and with the bright light. He says, "with the bright light."
6.4.10.36	These are the bright ones. Those who are the last.
6.4.10.37	These are the offspring. Those who are first.
6.4.10.38	He who knows this, his offspring are born as the last, not as the first.
6.4.10.39	Prajapati's eye fell out.
6.4.10.40	It fell down.
6.4.10.41	It entered the Vikankata.
6.4.10.42	It did not delight in the Vikankata
6.4.10.43	It entered the Yava.
6.4.10.44	It delighted in the Yava. 
6.4.10.45	That is the nature of the Yava. What is the nature of Vikankata?
6.4.10.46	If the Vikankata vessel is used for grinding, one grinds with flour.
6.4.10.47	He collects the eye of Prajapati.
6.4.10.48	The Brahmanas say, why do they not eat from the vessel of truth at the Sadas?
6.4.10.49	He should say, "It is the vessel of distress."
6.4.10.50	If the Adhvaryu were to eat, he would become blind and would be afflicted.
6.4.10.51	Therefore he does not eat.
6.4.11.1	The gods did whatever they did at the sacrifice, the Asuras also did that.
6.4.11.2	Those gods saw the Grahas of the Aggrayan.
6.4.11.3	They took them.
6.4.11.4	Then indeed they attained the foremost position.
6.4.11.5	He who knows thus, and whose Grahas of the Aggrayan are taken, attains the foremost position among his equals.
6.4.11.6	One who has an enemy should take them with the verse, "May I be free from disease."
6.4.11.7	He attains the foremost position of his equals, while his enemy is afflicted.
6.4.11.8-14	The gods who are in heaven, the eleven, he says. These are the only deities. He takes him from all of them. This is your birthplace. To all the gods, he says. For this deity is for all the gods. Speech indeed departed from the gods, standing at the sacrifice.
6.4.11.15	The gods, when speech had departed, took the Grahas in silence.
6.4.11.16	"Speech returned to them, saying, "You have taken me away."
6.4.11.17	It came back to the Aghamarana (cup).
6.4.11.18	That is why the Aghamaranas are called Aghamaranas.
6.4.11.19	Therefore speech is released at the Aghamarans.
6.4.11.20	When the earlier Grahas are taken in silence,
6.4.11.21	as if one were a servant.
6.4.11.22	"Thus much is mine, thus much shall not be of another."
6.4.11.23	The Adhvaryu, having taken up the Agrayaṇa, and having begun the sacrifice, releases speech in the same way.
6.4.11.24	He recites three times.
6.4.11.25	He chooses the Udgātṛs.
6.4.11.26	Prajapati is indeed the Agrayaṇa;
6.4.11.27	When one takes the Āgrayana and offers it, Prajapati smells the progeny.
6.4.11.28	Therefore a cow smells her calf when it is born.
6.4.11.29	The Āgrayana is indeed the self of the sacrifice.
6.4.11.30	He takes it at each pressing.
6.4.11.31	He makes the sacrifice continuous in the self.
6.4.11.32	He brings it from above.
6.4.11.33	He places it on the semen itself.
6.4.11.34	He takes it from below.
6.4.11.35	He indeed generates it.
6.4.11.36	Brahmin scholars say: Why does the Gāyatrī, being the smallest of the metres, carry all the pressing sessions?
6.4.11.37	This indeed is the calf of the Gāyatrīs, namely the Āgrayana.
6.4.11.38	It indeed carries all the pressing sessions, returning to it.
6.4.11.39	Therefore the cow returns to her calf.
6.5.1.1	Indra took up the thunderbolt against Vritra.
6.5.1.2	Vritra was afraid of the thunderbolt being raised against him.
6.5.1.3	He said,
6.5.1.4	"Do not strike me.
6.5.1.5	There is power in me.
6.5.1.6	I will give it to you."
6.5.1.7	Therefore he gave him the Ukthya.
6.5.1.8	He took up the second one against him.
6.5.1.9	He said:
6.5.1.10	Do not abandon me.
6.5.1.11	Is there any strength in me?
6.5.1.12	I will give it to you."
6.5.1.13	So he gave him the Ukthya.
6.5.1.14	He accepted the third.
6.5.1.15	Vishnu followed him.
6.5.1.16	He said: "Abandon me."
6.5.1.17	Do not abandon.
6.5.1.18	Is there strength in me?
6.5.1.19	I will give it to you."
6.5.1.20	Therefore he gave him the Ukthya.
6.5.1.21	Having created it, he killed the demon.
6.5.1.22	For the sacrifice was his illusion.
6.5.1.23	When the Ukthya is taken, the sacrificer seizes the strength and energy of his enemy.
6.5.1.24	He says, "To Indra, to the great, to the powerful."
6.5.1.25	For he gave it to Indra.
6.5.1.26	"To him, to thee, O Vishnu, thou art Vishnu."
6.5.1.27	He offers to Vishnu, saying, "Thou art Vishnu," because Vishnu stood by him.
6.5.1.28	He takes it three times.
6.5.1.29	For three times he gave it to him.
6.5.1.30	"This is thy place."
6.5.1.31	He says, "Thou art the offering again."
6.5.1.32	For he takes it again and again.
6.5.1.33	The Ukthya is the eye of the sacrifice.
6.5.1.34	Therefore the Soma-offerings follow the Ukthya.
6.5.1.35	Therefore the eye follows the body.
6.5.1.36	Therefore many follow one who goes.
6.5.1.37	Therefore one becomes fortunate among many.
6.5.1.38	Therefore one wins many wives.
6.5.1.39	If the Adhvaryu should desire, "I should offer myself to the fame of the sacrifice," he should stand between the Ahavaniya and the Havirdhana and bow down.
6.5.1.40	He indeed offers himself to the fame of sacrifice.
6.5.1.41	If he should desire, "Should offer the sacrificer to the fame of sacrifices," he should stand betwen the Sadas and the Havirdhāna and bow down.
6.5.2.4	"He says, 'The head of heaven, the desire of earth.'
6.5.2.5	He makes him the head of those who are equal.
6.5.2.6	He says, 'Vaisvānara Agni born for truth.'
6.5.2.7	For Vaisvānara is the deity of life.
6.5.2.8	Vaisvānari is taken on both sides.
6.5.2.9	Therefore the vital airs are on both sides, below and above.
6.5.2.10	The other Grahas are taken in half-measures.
6.5.2.11	Dhruva is taken in half-measure.
6.5.2.12	Therefore the Prāṇa of the other Prāṇas is half.
6.5.2.13	The other Grahas are offered in full measures, Dhruva in half-measure;
6.5.2.14	Therefore other creatures stand on bones, others on flesh.
6.5.2.15	The Asuras, desiring to take possession of the earth from the north,
6.5.2.16	the gods established it with the Dhruva.
6.5.2.17	That is the Dhruva's stability.
6.5.2.18	What is established from the north is for stability.
6.5.2.19	The Dhruva is indeed the life of the sacrifice.
6.5.2.20	The Hotri is the self.
6.5.2.21	When he pours the Dhruva into the Hotri's goblet, he places the life of the self in the sacrifice.
6.5.2.22	They say one should pour it down before the Udgitha.
6.5.2.23	For one eats before one's life.
6.5.2.24	They say one should pour down in the middle.
6.5.2.25	For one enjoys one's life in the middle. 
6.5.2.26	They say one pours down in the northern half.
6.5.2.27	For one partakes of one's life at the end.
6.5.2.28	One pours down when the verse to Visvedevas is being recited.
6.5.2.29	The Vaiśvadevya (rites) are for the offspring.
6.5.2.30	He places life in the offspring.
6.5.3.1	The gods went to heaven by means of the sacrifice.
6.5.3.2	They thought, "Men will follow us."
6.5.3.3	Having milked (the cow) in a year, they went to heaven.
6.5.3.4	The sages followed them with the rites of the seasons.
6.5.3.5	The Rtugrahas are taken for the purpose of knowing the world of heaven.
6.5.3.6	Twelve are taken.
6.5.3.7	Twelve months are a year; for the purpose of understanding the year.
6.5.3.8	The first two are taken together, the last two together.
6.5.3.9	Therefore, two and two are the seasons.
6.5.3.10	The Rtu vessel is with both mouths facing.
6.5.3.11	Who knows that from which the seasons are born?
6.5.3.12	"He says, "Send with the season."
6.5.3.13	He says it six times.
6.5.3.14	There are six seasons.
6.5.3.15	He pleases the seasons.
6.5.3.16	He says, "With the seasons," four times.
6.5.3.17	He pleases animals with four legs.
6.5.3.18	He says again with the season twice.
6.5.3.19	He pleases those with two legs.
6.5.3.20	"He says "Send with the seasons."
6.5.3.21	He says it six times.
6.5.3.22	"He says it four times, saying, "By the seasons."
6.5.3.23	Therefore, animals live on the seasons, having four feet.
6.5.3.24	He says it twice again by the season.
6.5.3.25	Therefore, animals with two feet and four feet live on the seasons.
6.5.3.26	"He sends by the season."
6.5.3.27	He says it six times:
6.5.3.28	"He says four times, saying "By the seasons."
6.5.3.29	He says twice again by the seasons.
6.5.3.30	That is the crossing.
6.5.3.31	The sacrificer makes the bridge for the attainment of the world of heaven.
6.5.3.32	One should not approach another.
6.5.3.33	If one approaches another, one would approach the season. The seasons would be confused.
6.5.3.34	The Adhvaryu approaches by the right, the Pratiprasthātṛ by the left.
6.5.3.35	Therefore the sun moves south for six months and north for six months.
6.5.3.36	You are taken with the offering.
6.5.3.37	You are the serpent.
6.5.3.38	He says, "For the lord of the fire."
6.5.3.39	They say, "There is a month of thirteen days."
6.5.3.40	He pleases him with that.
6.5.4.1	The seasonal cups are taken for the world of heaven.
6.5.4.2	The Jyotis is Indra and Agni.
6.5.4.3	When he takes the Indra-Agni offering in the Ritu vessel, he places the light above him for the attainment of the world of heaven.
6.5.4.4	Indra and Agni are the bearers of strength among the gods.
6.5.4.5	When the Indra-Agna offering is taken, he obtains strength.
6.5.4.6	He takes the Visvedeva offering in the Sukra vessel.
6.5.4.7	The creatures are the Visve Devas.
6.5.4.8	The hawk is the sun.
6.5.4.9	Because he takes the Soma in the vessel of the hawk which is dedicated to the Visve Deva, therefore the sun rises over all creatures.
6.5.4.10	Therefore all think, "He has risen over me."
6.5.4.11	He takes the Soma in a vessel dedicated to the Visvedevas.
6.5.4.12	The creatures are the Visvedevas.
6.5.4.13	The brilliance is Sukra.
6.5.4.14	When one takes the Visvadevya offering in the Sukra vessel, one places brilliance in the offspring.
6.5.5.1	Indra, in consultation with the Maruts, killed Vritra at the midday pressing.
6.5.5.2	When the Marutvatiya offerings are taken at the midday pressing, they are taken for the sake of the slayer of Vritra.
6.5.5.3	His seasons were confused when he struck Vṛtra.
6.5.5.4	He took the Marutvatīya (verses) in the Rtu-vessel.
6.5.5.5	Then indeed he knew the seasons.
6.5.5.6	When the Marutvatlya verses are taken in the Rtu vessel, it is for the knowledge of the seasons.
6.5.5.7	The sacrificer indeed strikes his enemy with this thunderbolt.
6.5.5.8	The Marutvatīya is indeed the first, the Prastara is the second, and the Sthūṇā is the third.
6.5.5.9	The sacrificer indeed prepares his weapon in the Marutvatīyas.
6.5.5.10	The bow is indeed the first; the string is the second; the arrow is the third. The bow is indeed the fourth.
6.5.5.11	He indeed holds back with the first, releases with the second, and strikes with the third.
6.5.5.12	Indra, having killed Vritra, went to the farthest, the most distant, thinking that there was no transgression.
6.5.5.13	He became green.
6.5.5.14	He saw these Marutvatīya (hymns) which are self-touching.
6.5.5.15	He grasped them.
6.5.5.16	He touched the vital breath with the first, the out-breath with the second, and the self with the third.
6.5.5.17	The Marutvatīya verses are taken up for the sake of touching the Self.
6.5.5.18	He touches the Prāṇa with the first, Apāna with the second and the Self with the third.
6.5.5.19	Indra killed Vṛtra.
6.5.5.20	The gods said to him, "This one has become great, who killed Vṛtra."
6.5.5.21	That is the greatness of Mahendra.
6.5.5.22	He (Indra) extracted this great Indra from the other deities after having slain Vritra.
6.5.5.23	When the great Indra is taken, the sacrificer extracts him from the other creatures.
6.5.5.24	He takes it in a bright vessel.
6.5.5.25	The great Indra is connected with the sacrificer.
6.5.5.26	Brightness is Sukra.
6.5.5.27	When he takes the Mahadendra cup, the sacrificer bestows brilliance.
6.5.6.1	Aditi, desiring a son, cooked a Brahma-rice for the Sadhyas.
6.5.6.2	They gave her the leftovers.
6.5.6.3	She ate it.
6.5.6.4	She conceived.
6.5.6.5	Four Adityas were born to her.
6.5.6.6	She cooked the second one.
6.5.6.7	It was chanted.
6.5.6.8	"These are the leftovers, and I shall eat them first, so that my offspring may be more prosperous."
6.5.6.9	He ate first.
6.5.6.10	She conceived.
6.5.6.11	From her was born a deformed egg.
6.5.6.12	He cooked the third (portion) for the Adityas.
6.5.6.13	"May this be for my enjoyment when I am tired."
6.5.6.14	They said,
6.5.6.15	"We choose a boon.
6.5.6.16	He who is born from this, he alone is not ours.
6.5.6.17	He who prospers in his progeny, may he be for our enjoyment."
6.5.6.18	Then Vivasvat, the sun, was born.
6.5.6.19	His progeny is this, namely, man.
6.5.6.20	Among them, only one prospers, he who sacrifices.
6.5.6.21	He becomes for the enjoyment of the gods.
6.5.6.22	The gods obstructed Rudra from the sacrifice.
6.5.6.23	He approached the Adityas.
6.5.6.24	They approached the gods of two deities.
6.5.6.25	They did not give them back.
6.5.6.26	Therefore, they do not give back even one who has sought refuge.
6.5.6.27	Therefore, the Adityas are taken from the gods of two.
6.5.6.28	Because they were born from the leftovers, they are taken from the leftovers.
6.5.6.29	He takes it with three verses.
6.5.6.30	Mother, father, son, that is the pair.
6.5.6.31	The egg, the embryo, the placenta, that is the same pair.
6.5.6.32	These are indeed cattle, namely the sun.
6.5.6.33	Curd is energy.
6.5.6.34	He places curd in the middle.
6.5.6.35	He places energy in the middle of the cattle. With the cooked and purified (curd) for the purpose of being fit for sacrifice.
6.5.6.36	Therefore, the raw (milk) yields cooked (milk).
6.5.6.37	The animals are indeed the sun.
6.5.6.38	He takes it after having surrounded (the fire).
6.5.6.39	He takes the animals from him by covering them.
6.5.6.40	The animals are the sun.
6.5.6.41	This is Rudra, namely Agni.
6.5.6.42	He takes (the oblations) after having surrounded (them).
6.5.6.43	He places the animals within Rudra.
6.5.6.44	This indeed is Vivasvat, the sun, that is the Upāṃśusavana (cup).
6.5.6.45	He indeed approaches this very Soma-drinking (cup) from the third pressing.
6.5.6.46	He says, "This is your Soma-drinking (Vivasvat), O Vivasvat, O Aditya."
6.5.6.47	He makes Vivasvat, Aditya, prosper with the Soma-drinking (libation).
6.5.6.48	"With the heavenly rain, I sprinkle you."
6.5.6.49	One should sprinkle for one who desires rain.
6.5.6.50	He indeed wins rain.
6.5.6.51	If it were to rain immediately, the rain would be torrential.
6.5.6.52	If it does not rain for a long time,
6.5.6.53	He does not settle down.
6.5.6.54	Because from the unsettled, offspring are born.
6.5.6.55	He does not perform the Anuvṣat-rite.
6.5.6.56	If he were to perform the Anuvșaṭ-rite, Rudra would follow the offspring.
6.5.6.57	He should not look after having offered.
6.5.6.58	If he were to examine it, his eye would be destroyed.
6.5.6.59	Therefore, it should not be examined.
6.5.7.1	With the vessel for the Antaryama, one takes the Savitrī from the Āgrayana.
6.5.7.2	Indeed, the Āgrayana is Prajapati, for the generation of offspring.
6.5.7.3	One does not press it down.
6.5.7.4	Because offspring are born from the unpressed.
6.5.7.5	One does no Anuvṣṭakāraṇa.
6.5.7.6	If one were to offer the Anuvṣat-call, one would let loose Rudra upon the offspring.
6.5.7.7	Savitr is indeed the Gayatri of the gods.
6.5.7.8	The Aggrayaṇa is taken for the Gayatri in the world.
6.5.7.9	When one takes the Savitr from the Aggrayaṇa in the Antaryāma vessel,
6.5.7.10	one takes it out from its own womb.
6.5.7.11	The All-gods have brought the third pressing to light.
6.5.7.12	They approached Savitar, the portion of the morning pressing, for the third pressing.
6.5.7.13	Then indeed they brought the third pressing into light.
6.5.7.14	When the Savitar cup is taken at the third pressing, it is for the bringing into light of the third pressing. The Savitar cup is the portion of the All-gods.
6.5.7.15	He takes with the Savitar cup from the All-gods pot.
6.5.7.16	The offspring are the Visve Devas.
6.5.7.17	The pot is for the Visve Deva.
6.5.7.18	Savitar is the lord of procreation.
6.5.7.19	When he takes from the pot for the Visve Deva with the Savitar vessel, he generates offspring for him through Savitar's procreation.
6.5.7.20	He takes Soma with Soma.
6.5.7.21	He places semen there.
6.5.7.22	He says, "You are well-protected, well-established."
6.5.7.23	For Soma is grasped for the sake of stability.
6.5.7.24	This is done for men, gods and ancestors.
6.5.7.25	He says, "You are well-protected, well-established."
6.5.7.26	He does this for men.
6.5.7.27	He says "Great."
6.5.7.28	He does it for the gods.
6.5.7.29	He says "Salutations."
6.5.7.30	He does this for the Pitrs.
6.5.7.31	These are the only deities.
6.5.7.32	He takes him from all of them.
6.5.7.33	This is your birthplace.
6.5.7.34	He says, "For all the gods."
6.5.7.35	This is for all the gods.
6.5.8.1	This is the breath, namely, the Upāṁshu.
6.5.8.2	When the first and the last cups are taken with the Upāṁśu cup, they proceed along the Prāṇa and ascend the Prāṇa.
6.5.8.3	This is indeed Prajapati, the Āgrayana.
6.5.8.4	The Upāṁśa is the Prāṇa
6.5.8.5	The wives generate offspring.
6.5.8.6	When he takes the Pātnīvata cup from the Āgrayana with the Upāmshu cup, it is for the generation of offspring.
6.5.8.7	Therefore, offspring are born after the vital breath.
6.5.8.8	The gods, seeking the world of heaven, went to their wives.
6.5.8.9	They did not know the world of heaven.
6.5.8.10	They saw this Patnīvata (rite).
6.5.8.11	They took it.
6.5.8.12	Then they knew the world of heaven
6.5.8.13	When the Patnīvata is taken, it is for the knowledge of the world of heaven.
6.5.8.14	Soma did not stand still when taken away by women.
6.5.8.15	Having made him a thunderbolt of ghee, they struck him.
6.5.8.16	They took him, the lifeless being.
6.5.8.17	Therefore women are lifeless. Even though they are not thieves, they are said to be more sinful than men.
6.5.8.18	When one offers the Pātnīvata cake with ghee, one takes him having brought him under control with the thunderbolt.
6.5.8.19	He says, "You are taken with the Upayāma ladle."
6.5.8.20	This is the Upayāmas.
6.5.8.21	Therefore offspring are born after this.
6.5.8.22	He says, "Of the son of Brihaspati."
6.5.8.23	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman among the gods.
6.5.8.24	He generates offspring for him through Brahman.
6.5.8.25	He says "O Soma."
6.5.8.26	Soma is indeed semen.
6.5.8.27	He places semen there.
6.5.8.28	He says, "With the senses."
6.5.8.29	The offspring is the sense.
6.5.8.30	He indeed generates offspring for him.
6.5.8.31	He says, "With Agni."
6.5.8.32	Agni indeed is the bearer of semen.
6.5.8.33	He says "With the wife" for the sake of union.
6.5.8.34	He says (to the sacrificer), "Do you drink Soma with the god Tvashtra."
6.5.8.35	Tvashtra indeed is the creator of the forms of animals and pairs.
6.5.8.36	He indeed places the form in the animals.
6.5.8.37	The gods wanted to kill Tvashtri.
6.5.8.38	He sought refuge with his wives.
6.5.8.39	They did not give him up.
6.5.8.40	Therefore, even one who has sought refuge is not given up.
6.5.8.41	Therefore at the Patnivata rite, Tvashtri is also seized.
6.5.8.42	He does not settle down.
6.5.8.43	From the unsettled, offspring are born.
6.5.8.44	He does no Anuvshada.
6.5.8.45	If one were to recite the Anuvṣat-verse, one would let loose Rudra upon the offspring.
6.5.8.46	If one were not to recite the Anūṣat-verse (the Soma) would be consumed by the Agnīd, who is not tranquil.
6.5.8.47	One recites the Anūṣaṭ-verse in a low voice.
6.5.8.48	One does not let loose Rudra on the offspring; the Agnīd consumes the Soma in a tranquil manner.
6.5.8.49	The Agnīd approaches the Hotṛ's seat.
6.5.8.50	The Nestr (says), "Let the wife be brought."
6.5.8.51	The Agnidh (says), "The Nestr alone should deposit the semen." The Nestr (then) says to the wife,
6.5.8.52	The Udgâtri (says), "Count."
6.5.8.53	The Udgâtâ is indeed Prajapati, for the begetting of offspring.
6.5.8.54	He makes it flow upwards.
6.5.8.55	He thus pours down the semen.
6.5.8.56	He makes (the wife) flow upwards with her thigh.
6.5.8.57	For it is with the thigh that semen is poured down.
6.5.8.58	He makes the naked one move.
6.5.8.59	When the naked one becomes so.
6.5.8.60	Then they become united.
6.5.8.61	Then the semen is emitted.
6.5.8.62	Then offspring are born.
6.5.9.1	Indra killed Vritra.
6.5.9.2	His head was cut off.
6.5.9.3	It became the Drona Kalasha.
6.5.9.4	From it Soma flowed.
6.5.9.5	It became Hariyajana.
6.5.9.6	He (Agni) thought:
6.5.9.7	"Do not offer me." He thought:
6.5.9.8	"If I offer, I will offer raw (meat).
6.5.9.9	If I do not offer, I will make a sacrifice-worthy (offering)."
6.5.9.10	He was appointed as the Hotṛ.
6.5.9.11	Agni said: "You will not offer raw (meat) to me."
6.5.9.12	He pleased him with cooked food.
6.5.9.13-18	He offers it cooked. When he offers it cooked, he offers it cooked. When he offers it cooked with the Hāriyojana verses, he offers it for cooking. He offers it cooked. He offers it cooked with many (verses). They become as many as these in the other world, yielding what is desired. And indeed they say, 'These are Indra's cows yielding what is desired, namely the Hāriyójana verses.'
6.5.9.19	Therefore one should offer with many (verses).
6.5.9.20	The Rk and the Sama are the two horses of Indra, drinking Soma.
6.5.9.21	The enclosing sticks are their (horses') covering.
6.5.9.22	If one were to offer without striking the enclosing sticks, one would give grass between the two offerings.
6.5.9.23	One offers after striking the enclosing sticks.
6.5.9.24	One gives grass only with the two enclosing sticks.
6.5.9.25	The unnetr offers.
6.5.9.26	The Adhvaryu now performs the sacrifice with the same (sacrificial) implements which have been used.
6.5.9.27	If the Adhvaryu were to offer with them, it would be as if he were to yoke again what has been released.
6.5.9.28	He offers with the head placed below.
6.5.9.29	For from the head he originated.
6.5.9.30	He offers after stepping back.
6.5.9.31	For stepping back Indra slew Vritra, for prosperity.
6.5.9.32	The sacrificial grass is the cattle.
6.5.9.33-38	If he were to break it, then the few animals would eat it and stand up. If he were not to break it, the many animals would eat it, and stand up. He breaks it with his mind. He does both. Many animals eat it and stand around it. They want to invite the unnetr. 
6.5.9.39	Those who drink Soma there, they obtain it.
6.5.9.40	He pours it on the northern altar.
6.5.9.41	The northern altar is indeed cattle.
6.5.9.42	Cattle are the Hāriyojana (cows).
6.5.9.43	They establish cattle in cattle.
6.5.10.1	Offspring and cattle are born after the Grahas.
6.5.10.2	The Upāṁśu and Antaryāma are goats.
6.5.10.3	The Sukra and Amāntin are men.
6.5.10.4	The Rtugrahas are taken by the Ekashfpas.
6.5.10.5	The Adityagraha is taken by the cows.
6.5.10.6	The Aditya graha is taken with the most verses.
6.5.10.7	Therefore cows are the most numerous of animals.
6.5.10.8	Because he takes the Upamshu three times with his hand, therefore a goat gives birth to two or three and then more females.
6.5.10.9	The Āgrayana is indeed the father.
6.5.10.10	The Kalasha is the son.
6.5.10.11	If one were to take from the Āgrayana, one should take from the Kalasha. Just as a father runs to his son, so is it.
6.5.10.12	If one takes from the Kalasha, one should take it from the Āgrayan.
6.5.10.13	Just as a son runs to his father, so is it.
6.5.10.14	The Āgrayaṇa is indeed the self of the sacrifice.
6.5.10.15	If a cup or a pot is broken, one should take it from the Āgrayaṇa.
6.5.10.16	He makes the sacrifice out of himself.
6.5.10.17	The Āgrayaṇa indeed is taken without being known.
6.5.10.18	One takes it in a vessel and offers it with the Vāyavya offering.
6.5.10.19	Therefore, one who kills a brahmin is unknown like a fetus.
6.5.10.20	They pour out the Avabhṛtha.
6.5.10.21	They pour out the pots, and take away the things for the wind-god.
6.5.10.22	Therefore they pour out the woman when she is born, and take away a man when he is born.
6.5.10.23	When he says "Puroruc," it is as if he were saying "Bring it."
6.5.10.24	When he takes up the cup, it is as if, having brought it, he were saying "It is here."
6.5.10.25	When he places it, he does so as if he were to go away after having deposited it.
6.5.10.26	Whatever is done with the Sāman and Yajus of the sacrifice, that is loose.
6.5.10.27	Whatever is with the Rk, that is firm.
6.5.10.28	The Upāṁśus are taken with the Yajus.
6.5.10.29	The Upamśus are taken above with the Rk for the stability of the sacrifice.
6.5.11.1	The other vessels are yoked, not the others.
6.5.11.2-6	Those which are used in the reverse order, one conquers that very world by them. For that world is indeed like the reverse. Those which are used again and again, one conquers this very world by them.
6.5.11.7	Those which are used in the reverse order, the plants follow them.
6.5.11.8	Those which are used in order, the plants again follow them.
6.5.11.9	Other vessels are used, not others.
6.5.11.10	Those which used in the reverse, the wild animals follow them to the forest.
6.5.11.11	Those which are used again, the domestic animals of the village bring to the village.
6.5.11.12	He who knows the source of the Grahas becomes the source of wealth.
6.5.11.13	The Uktha is called "clarified butter".
6.5.11.14	That is the source of the grahas.
6.5.11.15	What is chanted in a low voice is for the Upamshus and Antaryama grahas.
6.5.11.16	Whatever is chanted loudly is for the other grahas.
6.5.11.17	This is the origin of the Grahas.
6.5.11.18	He who knows this becomes the possessor of the origin.
6.5.11.19	He who understands the union of the Grahas, becomes united with offspring, cattle and union.
6.5.11.20	Some Grahas are taken with pots, others with Vayu.
6.5.11.21	This is the union of the grahas.
6.5.11.22	He, who knows this, becomes united with progeny, cattle and union.
6.5.11.23-29	Indra, with the intention of drinking Soma, drank Tvashtri's (Soma). He became afflicted with all diseases. He did not find peace within himself. He saw these Anusavana cakes. He offered them. By them he found peace within himself. Therefore, Anusavana cakes are offered.
6.5.11.30	Therefore one should eat the puròdasas after the Soma-drink.
6.5.11.31	He makes the Soma-drink enter into himself.
6.5.11.32	Soma does not pass over him.
6.5.11.33	The Brahmavadins say:
6.5.11.34	The Paṅkti is not obtained by reciting or by reciting the Yajus.
6.5.11.35	Then what is the Paṅkti-ness of the sacrifice?
6.5.11.36	The Paṅktis are obtained by the Dhānas, Karambha, Parivāpa, Puròdasa, and Payasya.
6.5.11.37	That is the reason for the fivefold nature of the sacrifice.
6.6.1.1	The oblations offered to Dakṣiṇā are offered for heaven.
6.6.1.2	One offers on the Garhapatya with two (verses).
6.6.1.3	The sacrificer has two feet; for stability.
6.6.1.4	One offers at the Āgnidhra fire.
6.6.1.5	One moves in the atmosphere.
6.6.1.6	One approaches the Sadas.
6.6.1.7	One makes him go to heaven.
6.6.1.8	With two Sūrya verses he offers on the Garhapatya.
6.6.1.9	He makes him ascend this very world.
6.6.1.10	With the verse "Leading" he offers on the Āgnidhra. For the attainment of the heavenly world.
6.6.1.11	Go to heaven.
6.6.1.12	O Lord of heaven.
6.6.1.13	Having offered gold, he takes it up.
6.6.1.14	He makes it go to the heavenly world.
6.6.1.15-20	"With form I approach your form," he says. For with form it approaches the form of those who have gold. "May Tutha, the knower of all, distribute the gifts," he says. Tutha, the distributor of gifts, distributes the gifts of the gods. He distributes them with that very (verse). "This is your gift, O Agni, that has fallen from the Soma," he says.
6.6.1.21-27	For his wealth comes from the moon. He says, "Lead it along the path of Mitra, for peace." "Go along the path of truth, with the moon as your fee," he says. Truth is indeed the truth. He divides them by means of truth and truth. "Leading along the path of the sacrifice," he says. For these (cows) indeed go along the path of sacrifice, namely the fees.
6.6.1.28	"He says, 'May I today honour the Brahman, the Rishi, the son of Rishi.'
6.6.1.29	This indeed is the Brahman, the son of the Rishi, who hears.
6.6.1.30	Therefore he says so.
6.6.1.31	'May you see the heaven, may you see the atmosphere,' he says.
6.6.1.32	He sends him to the world of heaven.
6.6.1.33	'Strive with the Sadasyas,' he says, for friendship.
6.6.1.34	May they go to the gods who give us, to the sweet ones.
6.6.1.35	He says, "May the giver enter."
6.6.1.36	We are the givers here.
6.6.1.37	He says this, "May the sweet ones enter us there."
6.6.1.38	He gives gold.
6.6.1.39	Gold is indeed a ladder.
6.6.1.40	He places light in front, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
6.6.1.41	He gives to the Agnidh (priest).
6.6.1.42	He pleases the seasons with Agni as their leader.
6.6.1.43	He gives to the Brahman (priest) for propagation.
6.6.1.44	He gives (gifts) to the Hotri (priest).
6.6.1.45	The Hotri is indeed the self of the sacrifice.
6.6.1.46	He makes the self of the sacrificer prosper with gifts.
6.6.2.1	He offers the Samitsya verses for the completion of the sacrifice.
6.6.2.2	Whatever is cruel in the sacrifice, whatever is spoiled, whatever it exceeds, whatever it does not exceed, whatever it does in excess, whatever it does, that he pleases with that.
6.6.2.3	He offers nine times.
6.6.2.4	There are nine breaths in a man.
6.6.2.5	The sacrifice is equal to a man.
6.6.2.6	He pleases the sacrifice as much as it is.
6.6.2.7	He offers six times with the Rg verses.
6.6.2.8	There are six seasons.
6.6.2.9-17	He pleases the seasons. There are three Yajus verses. These are the three worlds. He pleases these worlds. Go to the sacrifice. Go to the lord of sacrifice. He says this. He sends him to the lord of the sacrifice. Go to your own place. He says thus. He sends it to its own place.
6.6.2.18	This is your sacrifice, O Lord of sacrifice, with the recitation of the Sūkta, with the excellent heroes. He says this.
6.6.2.19	He bestows strength on the sacrificer.
6.6.2.20	Vasishtha Satyahāvyā asked Devabhāga:
6.6.2.21	"When the many-sacrificing Srāñjayas stood at the sacrifice for the sacrifice, they said, 'O Lord of sacrifice!' He said:
6.6.2.22	'O Lord of sacrifice! '
6.6.3.2	Whatever sin one commits after a year, that he atones for by them.
6.6.3.3	He goes to the waters for the final bath.
6.6.3.4	Varuna is in the waters.
6.6.3.5	He atones directly for Varuna.
6.6.3.6	The Raksases follow the path of the sacrifice with the intention of harming it.
6.6.3.7	He follows the Prastotar with a Sama.
6.6.3.8	The Sama is the destroyer of Raksases, for the destruction of Raksases.
6.6.3.9	He goes to the end three times.
6.6.3.10	These are the three worlds.
6.6.3.11	He removes the Rakshas from these worlds.
6.6.3.12	A man goes to the end of a man.
6.6.3.13	For a man is the protector.
6.6.3.14	For the removal of Rakshas.
6.6.3.15	The king Varuna has made a great (place), he says for stability.
6.6.3.16	O king, your hundred physicians, your thousand, he says.
6.6.3.17	He makes him well.
6.6.3.18	He says, "The noose of Varuna is bound."
6.6.3.19	He stands in the noose of Varun.
6.6.3.20	He offers on the sacrificial grass for the establishment of the offerings.
6.6.3.21	And he offers on the Agni-containing (grass).
6.6.3.22	He offers the Prajās at the Apabarāhisāka.
6.6.3.23	Sacrificial grass is progeny.
6.6.3.24	He releases the progeny from the noose of varuna.
6.6.3.25	He offers the two portions of clarified butter.
6.6.3.26	"The eyes of the sacrifice are not obstructed."
6.6.3.27	He offers to Varuna.
6.6.3.28	He is indeed released from the noose of Varuna.
6.6.3.29	"He offers to Agni and Varuna.
6.6.3.30	"He is indeed released directly from the noose."
6.6.3.31	He offers the two Anuyajas without sacrificial grass.
6.6.3.32	Sacrificial grass is indeed progeny.
6.6.3.33	He is released from the nouse of Varuna.
6.6.3.34	He offers four Prayāja offerings and two Anūyāja offerings.
6.6.3.35	They become six.
6.6.3.36	There are six seasons.
6.6.3.37	He indeed stands firm in the seasons.
6.6.3.38	He says, "O Avabhrtha, O Nichaṅkuna."
6.6.3.39	He indeed releases Varuna as prescribed.
6.6.3.40	He says "Your heart is in the ocean, in the waters."
6.6.3.41	Varuna is in the ocean.
6.6.3.42	He says, "May the plants enter you and the sun."
6.6.3.43	He makes him firm with water and plants.
6.6.3.44	He says "The goddesses, the waters, this is your embryo."
6.6.3.45	This is as per the prescribed ritual.
6.6.3.46	Soma is indeed cattle.
6.6.3.47-52	If one were to eat the drops, one would have cattle. Varuna would seize him. If one were not to eat them, one would be without cattle. Varuna wouldn't seize him. One should touch water. One has cattle. Varuna doesn't seize him.
6.6.3.53	He is released from Varuna's noose.
6.6.3.54	They come without waiting.
6.6.3.55	For Varuna to disappear.
6.6.3.56	He says, "You are the fire, may we be prosperous."
6.6.3.57	They come to worship the fire with kindling sticks.
6.6.3.58	You are the brilliance.
6.6.3.59	He says "Place the brilliance in me."
6.6.3.60	He places brilliance in himself.
6.6.4.1	He digs the altar with a wooden spade.
6.6.4.2	He measures with the axle of a chariot.
6.6.4.3	He measures the sacrificial post.
6.6.4.4	Having assembled the three-fold thunderbolt, he strikes his enemy, for covering.
6.6.4.5	If he were to measure within the altar, he would conquer the world of the gods; if outside the altar, the world of men.
6.6.4.6	He measures at the junction of the altar and the altar-site, for conquering both worlds.
6.6.4.7	One should make it the size of a small stone for one who desires the world of the fathers, the size of a belt for one who desires human world, the size of an offering cup for one who desires sense control, all equal for one who desires stability.
6.6.4.8	Those three which are in the middle, one should make them equal for one who wishes cattle.
6.6.4.9	Cattle indeed stand by these.
6.6.4.10	One becomes possessed of cattle.
6.6.4.11	One should separate the others.
6.6.4.12	He thus joins him with cattle.
6.6.4.13	If one desires (to perform) a sacrifice, one should dig a pit for him, the highest in the north, then the lower.
6.6.4.14	This is the pit.
6.6.4.15	He who digs it thus, dies immediately.
6.6.4.16	One should dig the highest in the south for one who desires heaven, then the lower.
6.6.4.17	The sacrificer makes the bridge by crossing over it for the attainment of the world of heaven.
6.6.4.18	When he puts two ropes on one sacrificial post,
6.6.4.19	then one obtains two wives.
6.6.4.20	When he does not put a single rope on two sacrificial posts,
6.6.4.21	then one does not obtain two husbands.
6.6.4.22-28	If one wishes that a woman be born to him, one should place it at the end of the line. A woman is born to him. If one wishes that a man be born to him one should place it in the middle of the line. A man is born to him.
6.6.4.29	Whatever is the sacrifice to the south, for the removal of the enemy.
6.6.4.30	All other sacrificial posts have animals.
6.6.4.31	But the Upasad post alone does not have animals.
6.6.4.32	The sacrificer is the animal.
6.6.4.33	If one does not point it out, the sacrificer would be afflicted.
6.6.4.34	One should point out, "This is your animal," the one whom one hates.
6.6.4.35	He points out to him the animal he hates.
6.6.4.36	If he does not hate, he should say, "The rat is your animal."
6.6.4.37	He does not harm domestic animals or wild animals.
6.6.4.38	Prajapati created beings.
6.6.4.39	He was exhausted by food.
6.6.4.40	He saw this Ekadasini.
6.6.4.41	By that he obtained food.
6.6.4.42	When there are ten sacrificial posts.
6.6.4.43	The Viraj has ten syllables.
6.6.4.44	Food is Viraj.
6.6.4.45	One obtains food through Viraj.
6.6.4.46	If there is one more, it is the teat itself. One milks it only with that.
6.6.4.47	This is indeed a thunderbolt, when there are eleven.
6.6.4.48	The powerful one, having crushed the sacrifice from the front,
6.6.4.49	The Pātnīvata (cup) is poured out for the sake of the sacrifice.
6.6.4.50	For the sake of prosperity.
6.6.5.1	Prajapati created the creatures.
6.6.5.2	He thought, "I am being robbed."
6.6.5.3	He saw this Ekadasinī (verse).
6.6.5.4	By that he placed life, strength and vigour in himself.
6.6.5.5	He who sacrifices creates like offspring.
6.6.5.6	He is now as if being robbed.
6.6.5.7	When it is eleven-fold, then indeed the sacrificer places in himself life, power and strength.
6.6.5.8	One offers with Agniyeṇa.
6.6.5.9	One makes a pair with Sarasvatī.
6.6.5.10	One deposits semen with Sūmya.
6.6.5.11	One propagates with Pauṣṇī.
6.6.5.12	It is Bārhaspatya.
6.6.5.13	Brhaspati is the Brahman of the gods.
6.6.5.14	Brahma himself generates offspring for him.
6.6.5.15	It is dedicated to all the gods.
6.6.5.16	All beings are dedicated to all the deities.
6.6.5.17	He generates offspring for him himself.
6.6.5.18	He obtains power with the Indra-dedicated, the community with the Marut-dedicated, strength and power with the Indra and Agni-dedicated.
6.6.5.19	The Savitr-dedicated is for success.
6.6.5.20	The Varuna-dedicated is for freedom from Varuna.
6.6.5.21	He offers the Indra-dedicated in the middle.
6.6.5.22	He places the Indra-offering in the middle itself.
6.6.5.23	He offers the Visvedeva-offering before the Indra-offering.
6.6.5.24	The Visvedeva-offerings are food.
6.6.5.25	He places food before (the Indra-offering).
6.6.5.26	Therefore food is eaten before (the Indra).
6.6.5.27	Having offered the Indra-offering, he offers the Marut-offering.
6.6.5.28	Maruts are the vital airs.
6.6.5.29	He binds him to the vital airs.
6.6.5.30	If one desires, "May he who is known be obstructed, and he who is obstructed be known," one should offer the Varuna animal to Indra's world, and the Indra animal to Varuna's world.
6.6.5.31	He who is known is obstructed.
6.6.5.32	He who was obstructed is known.
6.6.5.33	If one desires, "Let the offspring be confused," one should separate the animals.
6.6.5.34	It deludes the offspring.
6.6.5.35	If one were to offer the Varuna oblation before the offspring, Varuna would seize the offspring.
6.6.5.36	One offers it to the south, facing north.
6.6.5.37	After the offspring, for the release of the offspring from Varuna.
6.6.7.1	When they press Soma, they are killing it.
6.6.7.2	When it becomes Soma-related,
6.6.7.3	Just as they strike the dead with a covering, so is it.
6.6.7.4	If one were to offer in the northern or middle part, one would give equal food to the deities.
6.6.7.5	One offers in the southern part.
6.6.7.6	This is indeed the direction of the ancestors.
6.6.7.7	One appeases the ancestors in their own direction.
6.6.7.8	The Udgātṛs take it.
6.6.7.9	The Soma-offering is connected with the Sama-veda.
6.6.7.10-17	Whatever they do to the Sāman, that is its peace. They look at it. The Pavitra is indeed Sāumya. They purify themselves. He who does not see himself, would be a sinner. Having made an offering, one should look at it. For in that one sees oneself. And he purifies himself.
6.6.7.18	He who is of a calm mind should look (at the sun).
6.6.7.19	Whatever mind of mine has gone away or has not gone away,
6.6.7.20	That we have placed in ourselves, O Soma, the king.
6.6.7.21	The mind alone supports the Self.
6.6.7.22	One does not become of a calm mind.
6.6.7.23	At the third pressing, the sacrifice goes away from the pressing stone to the pressing stone.
6.6.7.24	He offers ghee with the Agni-Visnu verse.
6.6.7.25-34	Agni is all the deities. Vishnu is the sacrifice. He supports both the deities and the sacrifice. One performs the sacrifice in a low voice. For the purpose of union. Brahmin scholars say: Mitra takes care of the well-performed sacrifice. Varuna takes care of the ill-performed sacrifice. Where then is the sacrifice? Where is the sacrificer?
6.6.7.35	When one offers the Vasha animal dedicated to Mitra-Varuna.
6.6.7.36	One appeases the well-performed part of the sacrifice with Mitra.
6.6.7.37	The ill-performed part with Varuna.
6.6.7.38	The sacrificer does not suffer any distress.
6.6.7.39	Just as one breaks the ground with a plough, so the Rk and Sama hymns break the sacrifice.
6.6.7.40	When one offers the Vashā animal dedicated to Mitra and Varuna.
6.6.7.41	He follows the mind of the sacrifice which has been divided.
6.6.7.42	For peace.
6.6.7.43	The metres of him who sacrifices are exhausted.
6.6.7.44	The Vasha is the essence of the metres.
6.6.7.45	When he offers the Vasha to Mitra-Varuna,
6.6.7.46	He again pleases the metres.
6.6.7.47	For the purpose of not being exhausted.
6.6.7.48	And he places the essence in the metres.
6.6.8.1	The gods divided the power of Indra.
6.6.8.2	What was left over became the Atigrahyas.
6.6.8.3	That is why the Atigrahyās are called Atigrahyas (the taken-over).
6.6.8.4	When the Atigrahyā is taken, the sacrificer places in himself the power and strength of Indra.
6.6.8.5	The power of Agni by the Agniya (rite),
6.6.8.6	the power of Indra by the Indraya (rite), and
6.6.8.7	the power of Brahman by the Surya (rite).
6.6.8.8	The Atigrahya cups are the support of the sacrifice. The Prsthya (cups) are the backs.
6.6.8.9	If one were to take them at the Prsthya, the sacrifice would be taken forward and the Prsthyas would be linked together.
6.6.8.10	If one takes them at the Ukthya, the Atigrahyas would be linked together and the sacrifice would be turned back.
6.6.8.11	They should be taken at the Visvajit, which has all the backs, for the strength of the sacrifice.
6.6.8.12	Prajapati assigned the sacrifices to the gods.
6.6.8.13	He placed the dear body below.
6.6.8.14	They became the Atigrahya.
6.6.8.15	They say that his sacrifice is without a body, if the Atigrahya are not taken.
6.6.8.16	They should be taken at the Agniṣṭoma for the sake of the sacrifice having a body.
6.6.8.17	All the deities were similar.
6.6.8.18	They did not go to the unknown.
6.6.8.19	Those gods saw these Grahas.
6.6.8.20	They grasped them.
6.6.8.21	The Agniya (graha) was grasped by Agni,
6.6.8.22	the Aindra (graha) by Indra,
6.6.8.23	the Saumya (graha), by Surya.
6.6.8.24	Then they went away from the other deities.
6.6.8.25	For one who knows this, when these Grahas are grasped, he goes away from his sinful enemy.
6.6.8.26	These worlds are luminous, they say, and of equal strength.
6.6.8.27	He places light in this world with the Agni offering, in the atmosphere with the Indra offering.
6.6.8.28	For Indra and Vayu are yoked together.
6.6.8.29	He places the light in the yonder world with the Surya offering.
6.6.8.30	These worlds become luminous for him.
6.6.8.31	He makes them of equal strength.
6.6.8.32	These Grahas were known by Bamba and Visvavasu.
6.6.8.33	By them these worlds, the distant and the near, were obtained.
6.6.8.34	For him who knows thus, these Grahas are obtained, and these worlds, the remote and the near, shine forth.
6.6.9.1	The gods did whatever they did at the sacrifice, the Asuras did the same.
6.6.9.2	The gods, knowing this, established the metres and the pressing-places.
6.6.9.3	Then the gods became victorious over the Asuras.
6.6.9.4	He who knows this, and whose house is taken by the Adabhya, becomes victorious over his foe.
6.6.9.5	And because the gods conquered the Asuras by the Adabhyas, therefore it is called Adabhya.
6.6.9.6	He who knows thus, indeed, overcomes his foe, and his foe does not overcome him.
6.6.9.7	This is indeed the body of Prajapati called 'Atimocini' (liberating from death), which is Adabhya.
6.6.9.8	One takes it from the one who has put it on, for liberation.
6.6.9.9	One is liberated from the sinful foe, who knows thus.
6.6.9.10	They indeed kill Soma when they press it.
6.6.9.11	When Soma is slain, the sacrifice is slain, and when the sacrifice is slain the sacrificer is slain.
6.6.9.12	Brahmin-disputants say: What does the sacrificer do at the sacrifice by which he goes to heaven while living?
6.6.9.13	This is a living capture, since it is not a death.
6.6.9.14	He takes it from the unsprinkled (Soma).
6.6.9.15	He sends him to heaven while living.
6.6.9.16	They indeed cut off the sacrifice when they establish the Adabhya (bricks).
6.6.9.17	He spreads the tufts for the continuity of the sacrifice.

1.1.1	They say, "By what does one offer? In what is it offered?"
1.1.2	He offers by means of the breath alone; it is offered in the breath.
1.1.3	When they churn the fires, they generate the breaths.
1.1.4	As long as they churn, he does not breathe.
1.1.5	Then his breaths are in the kindling woods.
1.1.6	When he is being churned, ashes fall off.
1.1.7	That is his food.
1.1.8	One should know that food is what has produced him.
1.1.9	Smoke roars on.
1.1.10	That is his mind.
1.1.11	One should understand that mind is what has produced it.
1.1.12	Embers are extinguished.
1.1.13	That is the eye of him.
1.1.14	He should know that this is his eye.
1.1.15	This is the fire, and these are the ashes.
1.1.16	It moves sideways like a newborn child sucking at its mother's breast.
1.1.17	That is his ear.
1.1.18	He should know that this belongs to his ear.
1.1.19	It shakes the grass above.
1.1.20	The breath itself is his (true) birth.
1.1.21	One should know that this breath is his (true, not illusory) birth.
1.1.22	The Bha (i.e. the breath) is kindled.
1.1.23	The speech itself is his (real) birth.
1.1.24	Speech is his (true,) not illusory, birth.
1.1.25	He generates these five breaths.
1.1.26	Having arranged them in three ways and making the gods, he sits down offering oblations into them.
1.1.27	The gods indeed are his gods.
1.1.28	But these are his gods, in whom he offers.
1.2.1	When they say, "By what does one offer? In what is it offered?" he offers by the breath, it is offered in the breath. This food he offers in the breath.
1.2.2	He who offers in the breath, he indeed is the one who offers without desire, for he offers in the breaths that are increasing.
1.2.3	Now this indeed is the Brahman's own, namely, the oblation.
1.2.4	He places it in himself, in these immortal breaths.
1.2.5	What is placed in him does not perish.
1.2.6	When the mind departs, when the breath departs, when the eye departs, when the ear departs, when the speech departs, then it goes to these fires.
1.2.7	Then this body of his enters into these very fires, saying, "From this you were born; may this be born from you. Svāhā!"
1.2.8	He is born of oblations, of mind, of breath, of sight, of hearing, of speech, of the Ṛg, of the Yajus, of the Sāman, of Brahman, of gold, of immortality.
1.2.9	His breaths become immortal.
1.2.10	He makes this body immortal.
1.2.11	He who, knowing thus, offers the Agnihotra, attains immortality.
1.3.1	Prajapati lived for a thousand years.
1.3.2	Having completed seven hundred years, he conquered this very victory, which is his victory.
1.3.3	He, ascending to the heavenly world, said to the gods, "You should complete these three hundred years."
1.3.4	"So be it."
1.3.5	Having completed three hundred years, they conquered that very conquest which Prajapati had conquered.
1.3.6	All of them are indeed the measure of Prajapati. "A-yam, a-yam."
1.3.7	They said, "We shall complete this (sacrifice) with the bodies of gods, with the bodies of immortality."
1.3.8	"Men will not be able to complete this."
1.3.9	"Let us complete this sacrifice."
1.3.10	They completed it in a year.
1.3.11	They said, "This is indeed great. Let us complete it together."
1.3.12	They completed in twelve days.
1.3.13	They said, "This is a great (sacrifice), let us perform it together."
1.3.14	They performed it as a six-day Pañcadaśa sacrifice.
1.3.15	They said, "This (sacrifice) is great, let us perform it all together."
1.4.1	He performed the Trirātra, the Dvirātra, the Aptoryāma, the Atiratra, the Vājapeya, the Ṣoḍaśin, the Ukthya, the Agniṣṭoma, the animal sacrifice with Iṣṭi, the Cāturmāsya, the Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa, and these Agnihotra-offerings.
1.4.2	He did not lose from that.
1.4.3	This indeed is the invincible Agnihotra.
1.4.4	He who knows this does not suffer defeat.
1.4.5	When he touches water in front, water is truth, initiation is truth, that is his initiation.
1.4.6	He offers with the eight-syllabled formula, "Agni is light, light is Agni, svāhā."
1.4.7	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
1.4.8	That is the morning pressing.
1.4.9	With the mind alone, he offers the last oblation.
1.4.10	That itself is the midday pressing.
1.4.11	He eats after having wiped it.
1.4.12	That itself becomes the third pressing.
1.4.13	For the third pressing is indeed like something licked.
1.4.14	He sprinkles water above.
1.4.15	That itself constitutes his final bath.
1.4.16	When he offers these evening oblations, then by these two oblations he has offered all these sacrificial rites.
1.4.17	And when he offers these morning oblations, then through these two oblations, he has offered all those sacrificial rites.
1.4.18	Thus the Agnihotra is endless.
1.5.1-6	Then, when the animals have assembled in the evening, one should offer the Agnihotra for the sake of animals. Agnihotra is indeed Brahman. By means of Brahman, one thus encloses the animals. In the morning, when they have not been released. Agnihotr is indeed Brahman. By means of Brahman, he thus encloses the cattle.
1.5.7	He encloses these animals of Brahman on both sides.
1.5.8	He obtains animals.
1.5.9	He becomes one with many animals.
1.5.10	Now, one who desires heaven.
1.5.11	"The two oceans are moving, vast, and turning back and forth, like two feet on a path."
1.5.12	Indeed, the two oceans are moving - day and night.
1.5.13	Those who offer at night enter the ocean at night.
1.5.14	Those who offer at sunrise enter the ocean at sunrise.
1.5.15	There is a crossing of these two, like a bridge or a ferry, at sunset before nightfall, before sunrise.
1.6.1	Now, indeed, these two are the dark and the light, namely, day and night.
1.6.2	The day is light, the night is dark.
1.6.3	Those who offer at night enter the night, which is dark.
1.6.4	And those who offer when the sun has risen enter the day, which is light.
1.6.5-10	The sun and the moon are the only ones that go down and rise again. And indeed, this is the light of the sun. Savitar is indeed Prajapati. Prajapati is the All-gods. Thus his Agnihotra is offered to Prajapati in the All-gods.
1.6.11-15	Now, that which shines forth in the morning, in that lustre Prajapati created the creatures. Savitar is Prajapati. Prajapati is the All-gods. In Prajapati his Agnihotra is offered to the All-gods.
1.6.16	Now this is the way the day and night join together.
1.6.17	The Agnihotra is food.
1.6.18	He thus places food at the mouth of the day and night.
1.6.19	In the same way he joins them again in the morning.
1.6.20	The Agnihotṛa is food.
1.6.21	Now, having covered the food and drink from the mouth of day and night, he is freed from death again. The day and night are the two deaths.
1.7.1	The sun indeed is the one who sets. When it shines in six ways,
1.7.2	the ancients used to call it 'Vyamruchad'.
1.7.3	Now they call it 'Nyamruchad'.
1.7.4	Now, this is the setting of the sun, when one enters the Brahman with faith, with milk the cattle, with brilliance the fire, with nourishment the plants, with juice the waters, with the natural law the trees.
1.7.5	When a Brahman cleanses the Agnihotra vessels, when he moves around them, he places in him that faith with which he has entered.
1.7.6	Now when they milk the cow, it is with that milk that he enters the animals. He puts that into him.
1.7.7	And when he puts in the embers, it is with the heat that he enters the fire. He puts that in him.
1.7.8	Then when he sprinkles with grass, he puts into it that which is the sap of plants which has entered into them.
1.7.9	And when he brings back water, he puts into them that which is the juice of water which has entered into it.
1.7.10	Now when he puts on the kindling-wood, he puts on that very power of life by which he has entered the plants.
1.8.1	Having thus put it on, he offers in the evening.
1.8.2	He dwells during that night which is the womb-making one.
1.8.3	In the same way he again puts it on and offers in the morning.
1.8.4	He generates him.
1.8.5	He destroys all sin as soon as he is born.
1.8.6	The gods were born from Prajapati.
1.8.7	He who knows this is born thus.
1.8.8	He conquers as much as Prajapati conquered.
1.8.9	And he thinks, "This one is indeed following me and accumulating. Let him go to old age with his limbs, his body, and without any harm."
1.8.10	He indeed goes to old age with all his limbs, his entire body, and without harm.
1.8.11	Then he looks at him, thinking, "He who knows this will certainly know me. Let me enter him."
1.8.12	He enters him who knows this.
1.8.13	This indeed is the one hero who shines. He is Indra, he is Prajapati.
1.8.14	In him indeed is offered that which is offered by one who knows this and offers the Agnihotra.
1.9.1	Whatever evil is done during the day, the sun makes it happen.
1.9.2	Whatever is in the night, that is in the fire.
1.9.3	They said to each other, "If we are to be like this, then we will not be able to support offspring. Let us offer ourselves to each other in the form of food."
1.9.4	When the sun sets, he offers himself to the fire.
1.9.5	Whatever evil the sun does by day, that Agni removes by night.
1.9.6	When the sun rises, Agni rises after it.
1.9.7	The sun itself offers its own self.
1.9.8	Whatever evil Agni does by night, that the sun removes by day.
1.9.9	Just as a snake would be freed from its slough, or a reed from its sheath, so is he freed from all sin, he who, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra.
1.10.1	By the evening oblation alone, whatever sin one may have committed during the day, that Agni removes by night.
1.10.2	Whatever evil one does at night, the morning oblation removes it.
1.10.3	Just as a snake would be freed from its slough, or a reed from its sheath, so is one freed from all evil.
1.10.4	Just as when gold is melted, no part of it remains impure, so also when one who knows this offers the Agnihotra, no part of him remains impure.
1.11.1	Then indeed Nāgārī Janashruti said, "That very sun enters the womb of fire when it sets."
1.11.2	When he offers these evening oblations, he stands on the back of this Aditya, just as one would stand on both feet.
1.11.3	And when he offers these morning oblations, he raises him up with them.
1.11.4	Just as an elephant, standing on the seat of another elephant, carries it away, so does this deity, knowing this, carry away the one who offers.
1.11.5	It takes him to that world from which there is no return.
1.11.6	Whatever is beyond the sun, that is immortal, that he conquers.
1.11.7	Now, whatever is beyond the sun, that is the day and night. He removes it as one would remove a hair.
1.11.8	There are many worlds beyond the sun.
1.11.9	They all become his, they are conquered.
1.11.10	He has the freedom to do whatever he wishes in all of them, he who, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra.
1.12.1	The gods made a pact with Death.
1.12.2	That indeed is the fire, that is death.
1.12.3	They said, "We shall conquer him."
1.12.4	They said, "Let us offer a libation of ghee. By that we shall conquer him."
1.12.5	"So be it."
1.12.6	They offered a libation of clarified butter.
1.12.7	They made it food. It blazed forth again.
1.12.8	Therefore, wherever they offer a ghee-oblation, it is indeed rekindled.
1.12.9	They said, "Let us offer an animal-oblation and conquer him with that."
1.12.10	"So be it."
1.12.11	Having offered an animal-oblution, they melted the fat and offered it.
1.12.12	They made it food and it was rekindled.
1.12.13	Therefore, wherever they offer a sacrifice to the animals, it is indeed rekindled.
1.12.14	They said, "Let us offer a sacrifice of milk. Let us conquer him with that."
1.12.15	"So be it."
1.12.16	They offered a sacrifice of milk
1.12.17	With that they conquered him.
1.12.18	Therefore, wherever they offer the sacrifice of milk, the embers become.
1.12.19	They said, "We have conquered him by food. We want to conquer him again without being conquered."
1.13.1	They said, "Let us offer a Soma oblation. Let us conquer him with that."
1.13.2	"So be it."
1.13.3	They performed a Soma sacrifice.
1.13.4	They offered a Soma oblation
1.13.5	and conquered him with that.
1.13.6	Therefore, where they offer a Soma-oblation, there are only embers.
1.13.7	He who, knowing this, offers an oblation of ghee and an oblation of animals, approaches his beloved abode by that.
1.13.8	And when he offers a milk-oblation, he conquers him by that.
1.13.9	When he offers a Soma-obltion, it is as if one conquers and then triumphs, that is how it is.
1.13.10	He indeed overcomes these two deaths, namely, day and night.
1.14.1	He places the kindling wood with the formula, "To Prāṇa thee."
1.14.2	He offers with the formula, "To Apāna, the immortal, Svāhā."
1.14.3	Then he touches the ladle with the formula, “The heart is Prati, the mind is Santati, the eye is Ānati, the ear is Upanati, the speech is Āgati.
1.14.4	The offering has been established for the gods, as they approve.
1.14.5	He has placed me in immortality.
1.14.6	May my vital breaths enter me for greater good deeds.'
1.14.7	He indeed performs greater good deeds.
1.14.8	And indeed, in the other world, no evil word comes to him who, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra.
1.15.1	They say, "Whatever good or evil a living person does, what is the distinction between the two, the good and the evil?"
1.15.2	Whatever good a living person does is attained by the vital airs.
1.15.3	And whatever evil is done, that is done by the body.
1.15.4	When he departs from this world with such knowledge, his good deeds depart with his breath, and his bad deeds depart with his body.
1.15.5	They say that it is difficult to know when one who has died goes to dwell with the bad deeds.
1.15.6	But he who turns away from this while still alive, that is well known.
1.15.7	This Agnihotra indeed comes to an end.
1.16.1	The mind follows the breath, the speech follows the mind.
1.16.2	When one offers the first oblation with speech and the second with the mind, one turns away from evil and good.
1.16.3	Therefore they say, "Do not mix these two oblations."
1.16.4	For one turns away from good and evil by means of them.
1.16.5	When he offers the first oblation with the evening speech, he turns away from the evil that he does during the day.
1.16.6	And when he offers the second oblation with the morning speech, he turns himself away from the evil he does during the night.
1.16.7	Now when he offers the first oblation with speech at the morning Agnihotra, he thereby turns away from the evil done during the night.
1.16.8	And when he offers the second oblation with the mind, he thereby turns himself away from the evil committed during the day.
1.16.9	He who, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, thus turns himself away from evil done every day.
1.17.1	There are indeed two kinds of wombs.
1.17.2	One is the womb of the gods, the other is the womb of humans.
1.17.3	There are indeed two worlds.
1.17.4	One is indeed the world of the gods, and the other is the world of humans.
1.17.5	That which is the womb of human beings and the world of humans,
1.17.6	that is the procreation of a woman.
1.17.7	From that onwards offspring are born.
1.17.8	Therefore one should desire a good wife, so that the self may be born in a good family.
1.17.9	Therefore one should desire a wife, so that no one else may be born in my family, in my world.
1.17.10	When he is about to be born, the vital airs enter him first, then semen is emitted.
1.17.11	He emerges from these vital airs into space.
1.17.12	Therefore, from the same semen, when it is of a certain kind, it is born as of that kind.
1.17.13	Now this is the divine womb, the world of the gods, which is the Ahavaniya.
1.17.14	This indeed is the divine womb and the world of the Gods.
1.17.15	Therefore, if one were to offer on the Garhapatya, they would think that he is doing something that has not been done.
1.17.16	When he makes an offering, when he does good, he pours his self into this divine womb.
1.17.17	His self is born in that sun.
1.17.18	He who knows thus is of two selves and two wombs.
1.17.19	He who does not know is of one self and one womb.
1.17.20	When he who knows thus departs from this world,
1.18.1	His breath first goes out, and it tells the gods what is to be given up, saying, "This much of his is good, this much is bad."
1.18.2	Then he goes up with smoke, and the seasons are the doorkeepers of him.
1.18.3	He should tell them this from the wise one: "The seasons have brought the seed, the half-month has been born from the father's share. Do not let it be destroyed in the male creator. Let it be deposited in the mother of the male creator."
1.18.4	He is born and is born again. The twelfth month is the thirteenth month. He who knows this, he who knows this, I am he. The seasons bring him to the immortal. They bring him to the mortal.
1.18.5	Just as one who knows brings another who knows, just as one who knows himself brings another who knows himself, so do the seasons bring him. They bring him and conquer him.
1.18.6	He approaches him when he is shining. When he has approached, he asks him, "Who are you?"
1.18.7	He who tells him his name or clan, he says to him, "This self of yours that was in me, it is yours." In that self, having attained, the seasons flee and take away the one who has grasped the foot.
1.18.8	He who knows this attains the world of Prajapati. Therefore, one should say this: "Who am I? You are Suva."
1.18.9	"You are the heavenly one, I have gone to heaven." Who is Prajapati?
1.18.10	Indeed, one who knows this is heavenly, for he goes to heaven.
1.18.11	"You are that which you are, I am that which I am. Come, let us be together."
1.18.12	He goes to the same good-doing world. His sons inherit his wealth, his fathers his good deeds.
1.18.13	He who knows thus, is of two natures and two inheritances. He who does not know this, offers Agnihotra.
1.19.1	Speech is Agnihotra.
1.19.2	Its calf is indeed the mind.
1.19.3	With the mind, they milked the speech which had been let loose.
1.19.4	The calf, indeed, is the mother's own son, and he is milked first.
1.19.5	The mind is indeed the first, and the speech follows after.
1.19.6	Therefore the calf, which goes first, is followed by the mother.
1.19.7	The heart is the milking-pail, the breath is the rope.
1.19.8	By the breath alone is speech and mind spoken.
1.19.9	The cord is used to bind the calf and its mother.
1.19.10	Janaka, the king of Videha, asked Yajnavalkya, "Do you know the Agnihotra?"
1.19.11	He replied, "I know."
1.19.12	What does it mean?
1.19.13	Milk.
1.19.14	If there were no milk, what would be used for offering?
1.19.15	Rice and barley.
1.19.16	If there were no barley and rice, with what would one offer?
1.19.17	With other grains.
1.19.18	If there were no other grains, with what would he offer?
1.19.19	With wild plants.
1.19.20	If there are no wild plants, with what would be offer?
1.19.21	With water.
1.19.22	If there is no water, with what would offer?
1.19.23	He said, "At that time there was nothing here. Now it is being offered as if it were true."
1.19.24	He said, "Do you know the Agnihotra, Yajnavalkya? Let me pay homage to you. O revered one, I will give you a thousand."
1.19.25	Then he approached him.
1.20.1	Why does the learned one go away from his house, leaving the Agnihotra fire? The story is that his poetry is continuous with the fires.
1.20.2	When one has established the fires and then goes away, how does one's Agnihotra become uninterrupted?
1.20.3	Vajasaneyin said:
1.20.4	He who is the swiftest in the worlds, he who knows, when he departs, knows that. His poetry is thus, and thus uninterrupted by the fires.
1.20.5	He said, "The mind."
1.20.6	Indeed, the mind is the swiftiest in the worlds.
1.20.7	By the mind alone, his departure is not noticed. So he said.
1.20.8	Then he approached him.
1.20.9	When he goes far away, then he neglects it. Where is that offering of his which she who offers it to him offers in his house?
1.20.10	Vajasaneyin said:
1.20.11	He who was awake in the worlds, he who knows, when he goes away, knows that. Where is that oblation of his which she, who offers it to his house, offers?
1.20.12	He said: The breath.
1.20.13	The breath indeed is awake in the worlds.
1.20.14	The breath itself is his oblation.
1.20.15	Therefore they say, "The breath is the Agnihotra."
1.20.16	For as long as one breathes with the breath, for that long one offers the Agnihotra.
1.21.1	The milk of the cow is Rudra, the milk being poured out is Vayu, the milk being milked is Asvin, the milk being put down is Agnisomi, the drops are Visvedevas, the milk being drawn up is Pusha, the milk being let down is Sarasvati, the milk being drained is Mitra, the milk being taken up is Sarasvati, the milk is being taken up is Mitra, the wine is being taken up by the ladle is Brihaspati, the wine is taken up by the Soma-presser is Savitar, the wine is carried to the Adhvaryu is of Dyau and Prithivi, the wine is brought near is of Indra and Agni, the wine is offered to Agni is of Prajapati, the wine is poured out is of Indra.
1.21.2	This is the seventeenth Agnihotra.
1.21.3	The Vājapeya is also seventeen.
1.21.4	He who, knowing this, offers Agnihotra, conquers both worlds, the one offered to Agnihotra and the one offered to Vājapeya.
1.21.5	There are three pillars in Agnihotra, so said Śāṇḍilya.
1.21.6	If one offers to a fire that is not burning, it is a tree.
1.21.7	If one offers to a tree, it is a stump.
1.21.8	If one mixes it with another, it is a stub.
1.21.9	One offers to a burning fire, facing the fire.
1.21.10	One offers the last oblation beyond the fire.
1.21.11	He who, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, prospers with seventeen thousand (cows).
1.22.1	Āruṇi Vājasaneya, Praku, Vārṣṇa, Priyajanashruti, Budil Ashvatarashvi, and Vyaghrapady - these five were the great Brahmanas.
1.22.2	They said, "Janaka of Videha has been instructed in the Agnihotra. He seems to be overbearing. Let us debate with him about the Agnihotra."
1.22.3	They went to him.
1.22.4	They said to the student, "Please tell us."
1.22.5	He replied to them:
1.22.6	For them, the separate seats, separate water, separate Madhuparka, separate houses, and separate five-fold offerings were made.
1.22.7	Then, having shaved his hair, beard, and nails, and having anointed himself with ghee, he took up the staff and sandals.
1.22.8	They said to him, "O Brahmanas, please tell us the story."
1.22.9	They said, "You have spoken too much."
1.22.10	Then the first one asked them, "O Brahmana, do you offer Agnihotra?"
1.22.11	"They said to him, 'You have spoken too much.' 'He who is greater than you has spoken before you,' they said. 'Gautama, reply!'
1.23.1	He replied, 'I am the king of fame. I offer the Agnihotra. Therefore I am famous. Let fame be mine in my progeny, even at the end!'
1.23.2	Gautama said to him, ‘What is fame?’
1.23.3	Addressing Agni, he said, "This is fame." "This is fame" (he said) in the sun. "I am this fame in this fame." In the evening I offer this fame in that fame. In the morning I offer this fame to these two, may they lead me to that place where all desires are. May these two again conquer death for me.
1.23.4	"The gods, well-offered, will be satisfied." So he praised.
1.23.5	Then he asked another, "How did you offer the Agnihotra?"
1.23.6	He replied, "O king, I offer the Agnihotra truthfully. Therefore I am truthful. Therefore, when I speak truthfully, it becomes clear."
1.23.7	He said to him, "What is the truth?"
1.23.8	When he points out Agni, he says, "This is the truth." The sun is the truth. I am the truth in this truth. I offer this truth in the evening. I offer that truth in the morning. May those two lead me to that place where all desires are. May those two again conquer death for me.
1.23.9	"May the well-offered oblations please the gods." Thus he praised.
1.23.10	Then he asked another, "How did you offer the Agnihotra?"
1.24.1	He said, "O Varshna, give me the most and best of your wealth." The king said, "I offer Agnihotra. Therefore, I have the most and best wealth. Let my wealth be the last among all creatures."
1.24.2	He said to him, "Agnivesha, what is the most important and best of wealth?"
1.24.3	Addressing Agni, he said, "This is the most excellent and best of possessions." "This is the best and most excellent of possessions." "The sun is the best and the most excellent of possessions. I am the best and most excellen of possessions in this world. In the evening, I offer to this best and most excellent possession. In the morning, I offer to the best and most excelle possession in the other world. May these two lead me to the place where all desires are. May these two again conquer death for me."
1.24.4	"The gods, well-offered, will be satisfied." Thus he praised.
1.24.5	Then he asked another, "How did you offer the Agnihotra?"
1.24.6	He said, "O Janashruta, I offer the Agnihotra as the king of light. Therefore I am light. Light should be the last thing in my subjects."
1.24.7	He asked him, "What is the brilliance?"
1.24.8	Addressing Agni, he said, "This is the light." "This is the sun." "I am the light." "I offer in the evening in this light. I offer in the morning in that light." "May those two lead me to where all desires are. May those two again conquer death for me."
1.24.9	"May the gods be well-sacrificed!" thus he praised.
1.24.10	Then he asked another, "How did you offer the Agnihotra?"
1.25.1	He said, "I am the king of the Asvatara-Asvins, the son of Vyagrapadya, the son of Arkasva. I offer the Agnihotra, for the horse is the food of the gods."
1.25.2	He said, "Who is the horse? Who is the food?"
1.25.3	Addressing Agni, he said, "This is the horse, this is the horse, the horse is the sacrifice, the horse is to be sacrificed." The horse is the sun, the horse is Medha, the horse is Methy. I am this horse, Medha, Methy, in this sun, I offer in the evening. This sun, in that horse, Medha Methy, I offer in morning. These two will lead me to that place where all desires are. These two will again conquer death for me.
1.25.4	Suhūta, the son of Praśasyā, said, "He who tells me about the Agnihotra and its destination, to him I will give a boon."
1.25.5	They said, "We do not know about the Agnihotra or its destination. Tell us about the Agnihotra, and we will give you five separate boons."
1.25.6	He who is going to offer the Agnihotra, having directed the fire, says, "This is the path, this is the way." The sun is the way. I am that. This is the path, that is the way. In the evening I offer this path, in the morning I offer this way. May these two lead me to that place where all desires are. May these two again conquer death for me.
1.25.7	"Well-offered," they said, praising him. "Choose the boons we shall give you."
1.25.8	He said, "This alone is my boon: I shall give you separately five thousand horses."
1.25.9	These are the Agnihotra offerings, these are the desires.
1.26.5	He thus makes them (the fires) turn towards him.
1.26.6	This indeed is death, the fire that licks (its food).
1.26.7	Having appeased him with those oblations, he conquers the earth, the worlds, Agni, the god, the gods.
1.26.8	He who, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, attains union with the divine Agni and his world.

1.28.8	Just as gold, when melted, becomes pure gold, so also, having removed the evil and sin from one's enemies, one goes to heaven.
1.28.9-13	This is the hare, which is on the moon. For he rules over all this. This is Yama, which is on moon. For this rules over all this.

1.38.14	Having bound the thirteenth night with a goat or a sheep, one should release it.
1.38.15	Having made it so as to be without an end, one should offer it.
1.38.16	Indeed, those ancient men offered Agnihotra for twelve days.
1.38.17	Therefore, a cow carries them, a mule carries them, a horse, a donkey, an elephant, all carrying the sacrificial fire, carry them.
1.39.1	He says, "Let the Agnihotra be carried."
1.39.2	When the heaven and earth are afflicted, the Rudras take the milk of the Vasus. "The fear of the born is firmly established." He places the embers, saying, "For the one who has been born."
1.39.3	Then he places it, saying, "This is the placing of the fire of Vaisvānara. May Agni protect your brilliance. For truth, to you."
1.39.4	Then he illuminates it, saying, "May light be united with light."
1.39.5	Then he brings back the water, saying, "With that juice of yours which has entered the water, do thou be united."
1.39.6	Whatever directions have swallowed him there, that he brings back to him, saying, "The Rakshas is hidden, the evil spirits are hidden."
1.39.7	He makes three rounds around the fire.

1.39.10	Then taking up the ladle and the spoon, he burns them, saying, "The Rakshas have been repelled, evil spirits have been repelled."
1.39.11-15	Then he cleans the ladle with the formula, "With the divine Savitr, with the divine Savitr I cleanse thee." In the evening he says, "With the gods, with the evening Savitr." In the morning he says, "with the gods, with Savitr of the morning." "Thou art golden, made of gold, with a golden handle, having the leaves of immortality, the stream of sacrifices." Indeed, he becomes the stream of sacrifices. Then he says, "I shall take up."
1.39.16	"Om, I am heaven, the world."
1.40.1	The first ladle that is raised is the form of the New and Full Moon sacrifices.
1.40.2	For one who knows this, the first ladle that is lifted becomes a form of the New Moon and Full Moon sacrifices, and his desires are fulfilled.

1.40.10	The man is the fire-stick, the food is the fuel. May the food go to the heavenly world with its splendour. Where is the abode of the gods and the sages dear, there may this Agnihotra of mine go. He places it silently.
1.40.11	Then he places the fire-stick on the fire, saying, "I place the golden post for your ascent to the heavenly world. Svāhā!"
1.40.12	Then he offers.
1.40.13	The first oblation he offers to the gods.
1.40.14	The second oblation he offers for the sages.
1.41.1	Then he cleanses.
1.41.2	The first cleansing he performs for the Gandharvas and Apsarases.
1.41.3	The Gandharvas and Apsaras say to him, "May your faith not fail you. Be satisfied with all your desires and attain the heavenly world."
1.41.4	Then, when he anoints the second time, he pleases the Grahas and the Pitrs.
1.41.5	The Grahas and the Fathers say to him, “May your faith not be lost. Be satisfied with your desires and attain heaven.”
1.41.6	Then when he eats twice with the finger, by the first eating the Prāṇa and Apāna are satisfied.
1.41.7	The Prāṇa and the Apāna said to him, "May your faith not depart from you. Be satisfied with all desires. Attain the heavenly world."
1.41.8	Then when he eats the second time, by that the Udāna and Prāṇā are satisfied.
1.41.9	The Udana and Apana Vayu said to him, "May your faith not be lost. Be satisfied with all desires and attain the heavenly world."
1.41.10	Then when he eats with the ladle, he pleases the Samavana Vayu and the embryos.
1.41.11	The Samavana Vayu said to the embryos, "May your trust not be lost. May you be satisfied with all desires. May you attain the heavenly world.
1.41.12	Then when he drinks from the ladle, thereby he pleases the gods.
1.41.13	The gods say to him, "May your faith not depart from you. Be satisfied with all your desires. Attain the heavenly world."
1.41.14	Then when he pours out the rinsing of the ladle, thereby pleases the birds.
1.41.15	The sages say to him, "May your faith not fail. Be satisfied with all desires. Attain the heavenly world."
1.41.16	Then, having cleaned the ladles and sprinkled them towards the north, he pleases the sages with that.
1.41.17	The sages say to him,
1.41.18	Then when he pours out the water used for washing the pot, he thereby propitiates the people of the serpents.
1.41.19	The people of the serpents say to him, "May your faith not be lost. Be satisfied with all desires. May you attain the heavenly world."
1.41.20	Then, when he stands to the right of the fires, having gone around either behind or in front, he becomes Prajapati himself, thinking, "Who am I? Whose am I?"
1.42.1	Bhṛgu, the son of Varuna, was a student.
1.42.2	He thought, "I am superior to my father, superior to the gods, superior to other Brahmins, to the students."
1.42.3	He, Varuna, looked at him and said, "My son does not know anything. I shall make him wise."
1.42.4	He seized his breath.
1.42.5	He was distressed.
1.42.6	He went to the highest world.
1.42.7	He came to this world.
1.42.8	He devoured the man after having killed him.
1.42.9	He said, "This is indeed a great thing. What is this?"
1.42.10	He said to him, "Do you ask your father Varuna? He will tell you this."
1.42.11	The second one came.
1.42.12	A man swallowed a man crying.
1.42.13	He said, "What is this that has happened?"
1.42.14	They said to him, "Do you ask your Father Varuna? He shall tell you this."
1.42.15	The third one came.
1.42.16	The man, silent, swallowed the man.
1.42.17	He said, "What is this that has happened?"
1.42.18	They said, "You are asking your father Varuna. He will tell you."
1.42.19	He came to the fourth.
1.42.20	Two women were quarreling over a great wealth.
1.42.21	He said "What is this?"
1.42.22	He said to him, "Do you ask your father Varuna? He will tell you."
1.42.23	He came to the fifth.
1.42.24	At the stream of blood and the stream of ghee, at the flowing of the arms,
1.42.25	The one who was at the stream of blood, he was a naked man with a club, guarding it.
1.42.26	Then there is the stream of ghee, and for that there are golden men with golden vessels, who have fulfilled all desires.
1.42.27	He said, "This has happened. What is this?"
1.42.28	They said, "You are asking your father Varuna. He will explain this."
1.42.29	He came to the sixth.
1.42.30	There were five rivers, five lakes, five ponds, and five streams of sweet water flowing.
1.42.31	There was dancing, singing, and the sound of lutes, and there were groups of celestial nymphs. The fragrance was very pleasant and the sound was loud.
1.42.32	He said, "Oh, what is this?"
1.42.33	He said to him, "Do you ask your father Varuna? He will tell you this."
1.43.1	He then turned back from there.
1.43.2	He then went to Varuna.
1.43.3	He said to him, "Have you come, dear son?"
1.43.4	He said, "I have come, dear father."
1.43.5	He said, 'Did you see, dear son?'
1.43.6	He said, ‘I saw, dear father.’
1.43.7	He said, “What, dear son?”
1.43.8	A man is bound by another man, and then he is called a sinner.
1.43.9	"Oṃ, he said."
1.43.10	Those who in this world offer Agnihotra without knowing this, and cut down the trees and add them, in that other world, the trees, taking the form of men, devour them.
1.43.11	What is the remedy for that?
1.43.12	Whatever kindling wood one adds, that is the remedy for it. By that one is freed from that."
1.43.13	What is the second?
1.43.14	The man himself cries out to the man, 'You are a sinner!'
1.43.15	He said, 'Om!'
1.43.16	Those who cook the animals of one who knows this in this world, while he is offering Agnihotra, they are eaten by the animals in the other world, assuming the form of a man.
1.43.17	What is the remedy for that?
1.43.18	The first oblation that is offered with speech, that is the atonement for him; by that he is freed from that.
1.43.19	What is the third?
1.43.20	A man who does not speak, he is evil.
1.43.21	He said, "Om."
1.43.22	Those who in this world offer Agnihotra without knowing this, and cook rice and barley silently, without speaking, they are eaten in the other world by rice and barley in the form of men.
1.43.23	What is the remedy for that?
1.43.24	The remedy is that one offers the last oblation to the mind. By that one is freed from that.
1.43.25	What is the fourth?
1.43.26	Two women had a great deal of wealth.
1.43.27	He said, "Om."
1.43.28	Faith and disbelief were yours.
1.43.29	Those who offer Agnihotra in this world, but do not worship with such knowledge and faith, that goes to disbelief. What is believed by those who have faith, that goes towards faith.
1.43.30	What is the atonement for that?
1.43.31	Whatever he eats twice with his finger, that is the atonement for it, by that he is freed from it.
1.44.1	What is the fifth?
1.44.2	In the stream of blood and the stream of ghee, in the flowing of the arms.
1.44.3	The one who was the stream of blood, he was protected by a naked man with a club.
1.44.4	Then there is the stream of ghee, and for that there are golden men with golden vessels, who draw out all desires.
1.44.5	"He said, "Om!"
1.44.6	"Those who in this world squeeze the blood of a brahmin who knows this, but does not offer Agnihotra, that is the stream of blood."
1.44.7	Then that man who is black, naked, and holding a club, who concealed her, that is his anger, and that is his food.
1.44.8	What is the atonement for that?
1.44.9	Whatever he eats with the ladle, that is the atonement for him. By that he is freed from that.
1.44.10	And whatever she sprinkles with the ladle, having wiped it, towards the north, that is the stream of ghee.
1.44.11	For him, golden men with golden vessels fulfilled all desires.
1.44.12	What is the sixth?
1.44.13	Five rivers, ponds, lotus ponds, and streams of sweet water.
1.44.14	In them, dancing, singing, the sound of the vina, groups of celestial nymphs, and a great sound of fragrance.
1.44.15	Oṃ, he said.
1.44.16	These worlds were mine alone.
1.44.17	By whom are they conquered?
1.44.18	By this alone, taken five times and taken five times more.
1.44.19	He said, "Indeed, there is no space for conquering the worlds other than the Agnihotra.
1.44.20	Today itself is the day of fasting for my Agnihotra."
1.44.21	They did it like that.
1.44.22	He who, knowing this, offers the Agnihotra, the trees in the other world do not devour him in the form of a man, nor the cattle, nor the rice and barley. He does not lose his faith and disbelief. He attains the stream of blood and the stream of ghee.
1.45.1	This indeed is the Agni Vaiśvānara, who shines.
1.45.2	His night is the kindling wood, his day is the light, his rays are the smoke, the stars are the sparks, the moon is the ember.
1.45.3	In that fire, the all-pervading fire, the gods offer the nectar, the water, every day.
1.45.4	From that offering, the king Soma is born.
1.45.5	The fire, the all pervading fire, is indeed the thunder.
1.45.6	Its heaven is the kindling wood, lightning the light, clouds the smoke, the cool winds the sparks, and the thunderbolt the embers.
1.45.7	In this Agni Vaisvânara, the gods offer every day the Soma-juice.
1.45.8	From that offering, when offered, rain is produced.
1.45.9	The earth itself is Agni Vaisvânarend
1.45.10	Its atmosphere is the kindling wood, its fire is light, its smoke is wind, its sparks are the stars, and its directions are the embers.
1.45.11	In that fire, the all-pervading fire, the gods offer oblations to rain every day.
1.45.12	From that oblation offered, food is produced.
1.45.13	The person himself is the fire, the all pervading fire.
1.45.14	His speech is the fire, his eye is the light, his breath is the smoke, his mind is the sparks, his ear is the embers.
1.45.15	In that fire, the all-pervading fire, the gods offer oblations every day.
1.45.16	From that oblation, the semen is generated.
1.45.17	The woman is indeed the fire, the all pervading fire.
1.45.18	His penis is the kindling wood, his genitals are the fire, his light is the fire, his smoke is the fire, the sparks are the fire, the touch is the fire, and the embers are the fire.
1.45.19	In this fire, the all-pervading fire, the gods offer semen every day.
1.45.20	From that offering, a man is born.
1.45.21	He is born as a man in the fifth creation.
1.45.22	In the fifth creation, the divine waters speak as the voice of man, saying, "As he goes to this world."
1.46.1	His Agni is indeed Agni Vaiśvānara.
1.46.2	His herbs and trees, his grass and light, his smoke and smoke, his sparks and sparks, his embers and embers.
1.46.3	In that fire, the all-pervading fire, the gods offer the man every day.
1.46.4	From that offering that is offered, the man is born into this world.
1.46.5	This is his world, which again rises up.
1.46.6	The day and night of that god are half-months, months, seasons, and years. The protector is he who shines.
1.46.7	The day-and-night should be observed.
1.46.8	He is the one among the thieves who, having returned with a stick and a ray, asks, "Who are you, man?"
1.46.9	What would an ignorant person do?
1.46.10	He strikes him.
1.46.11	When he is thus obstructed, his good deeds are destroyed in three ways.
1.46.12	He takes the third one.
1.46.13	He goes to the third direction.
1.46.14	With the third one, he goes to this world.
1.46.15	He is attached to that world which is won by giving.
1.46.16	Then indeed, he attains death as the ultimate.
1.46.17	He who knows this is not conquered by death.
1.46.18	When he is afflicted, when the ground is even and clear, he should say, "Here they churn the fires for me."
1.46.19	The lord of the sacrifice is the one who is afflicted.
1.46.20	If he does not go to the other world from this world, then they should take him.
1.46.21	The two fires are to be placed in different places. The Upavasatha fire is to be taken from the Anvāhārya-pācana fire.
1.46.22	The sacrificial vessels, clarified butter, water, wood, the covering cloth, the razor and the nail-cutter are to be taken.
1.46.23	They go to a place where the ground is even and clear.
1.46.24	There they place the fires.
1.47.1	Then, in this direction, they dig a well and throw in the hair and beard.
1.47.2	Having thrown in the hair and beards, they cut the nails.
1.47.3	Having cut the nails, they make it without intestines.
1.47.4	Having made it without intestines, they make it free from excrement.
1.47.5	Having made the excrement free from excrement, they cover the excrement in the well with sand.
1.47.6	They cover up his sin.
1.47.7	Having washed the entrails, they bring him back, having placed him between the fires.
1.47.8	Having placed it between the fires, having melted clarified butter over the Garhapatya fire, having taken four spoonfuls, having gone, he offers on the Ahavaniya fire, having placed the kindling wood, having begun.
1.47.9	This is yours, this is yours. This is your birthplace, this is its birthplace. You are the father, the son is the creator of the world. O Jātavedas, lead him to the place where the world of the virtuous is. You were born from this. May this be born from you. Svāhā.
1.47.10	He is born of oblations, of mind, of breath, of sight, of hearing, of speech, of the Ṛg, of the Yajus, of the Sāman, of Brahman, of gold, of immortality.
1.48.1	Then they build this altar.
1.48.2	On it they place him.
1.48.3	He should place the two ladles on his nostrils, the Juhu in his right hand, the Upasthala in the left, the Dhruva on the chest, the Agnihotra ladle on the mouth, the vessel on the head, the Idopāvana on the ears, the Prāshitraharana on the belly, the Patrī on the navel, the Samāvattadhānī on the testicles, the Dṛṣadupala on the penis, the Shamia on the anus, the Kṛṣṇājina on the thighs, the Anupṛṣṭa on the back, the Spha on the sides, the Musala and the Śūrpā on the shoulders, the Patta on the arms, and the Ulukhalam on the hands.
1.48.4	The remaining sacrificial vessels are placed above.
1.48.5	They bring in the earthen vessels and give away the iron ones.
1.48.6	Then they fill it with ghee.
1.48.7	They pour ghee into the sacrificial vessels.
1.49.1	Then they bring in the covering cloth.
1.49.2	Having sprinkled it, one should shake it three times, and then strike it with a stone.
1.49.3	Some people make the animal go round to the right.
1.49.4	One should not do so.
1.49.5	Having dug out the omentum of that (animal), they spread it on the head.
1.49.6	The heart on the heart, the arms on the arms, the feet on the feet, the head on the head, the tail on the tail, the skin on the skin.
1.49.7	They distribute the other limbs according to the limbs.
1.49.8	Then they cover it with its own skin, saying, "Prosper with your own body."
1.49.9-13	Having spread it, they light it. He should do it in such a way that the Āhavanīya fire goes first. Then the world of gods returns to him. Then as the Anvāhāryapacana fire, then the world of the ancestors returns to him. Then as the Garhapatya fire, then he is established in this world with offspring and cattle.
1.49.14	The body of him who is burning is shaken by smoke.
1.49.15	Because he shakes, he is Dhuna.
1.49.16	Dhuna is his name.
1.49.17	They call him Dhūma (Smoke) indirectly, for indirectly they call him.
1.49.18	The gods are fond of the indirect.
1.49.19	From smoke one goes to night, from night to day, from day to the waning fortnight, from the waning fortnight to the full moon, from the full moon to the month.
1.49.20	They join together in this month.
1.49.21	One of the thieves, having gone back with a stick and a ray, asks, "Who are you, O man?"
1.50.1	He should reply.
1.50.2	The seasons have brought forth the semen from the wise one, the semen has been produced in half a month from the father's share.
1.50.3	What they offer to the wise Soma king, that is it.
1.50.4	They send him to the male, the doer.
1.50.5	They send it to the male, indeed, the doer,
1.50.6	To the mother of the male, the doing.
1.50.7	He sprinkles him on his mother.
1.50.8	He is born and is born again, and is thirteen months old, and twelve months old.
1.50.9	This is the thirteenth, he who shines.
1.50.10	The gods and the Asuras were contending for it. The gods won it. The gods said, "We have won it." The Asuras said, "We shall win it." The gods said, "We have won it." The Asuras said," "We shall win." The gods said," "We have won." The Asuras then said, "We will win." The gods then said, "You have won." The gods then won it. The Asuras then won it. Then the gods won it. Then they said, "We know it." Then they said, "We know it." We shall bring you from death to immortality. With your father of twelve or thirteen years, with your mother, with your faith, with your food, with your truth, my father is the day, my mother is the night, I am the truth. You bring me from death to immortality."
1.50.11	They bring him from death.
1.50.12	Just as the wise one approaches the wise, just as the knowing one approaches the knowing, so the seasons bring him.
1.50.13	He is indeed conquered by them.
1.50.14	He who knows this is indeed not a human being.
1.50.15	He alone is one of the gods who knows this.
1.50.16	His fathers and grandfathers return to him, saying, "What did you not bring?"
1.50.17	He should say to them, "Whatever merit I have done, that is yours."
1.50.18	His sons inherit his wealth, while his fathers inherit his good deeds, not his evil deeds.
1.50.19	He who shines thus divides it into three parts and attains the same world as him.
1.51.1	Those who offer Agnihotra perform a long sacrifice.
1.51.2	This indeed is the sacrifice for overcoming old age.
1.51.3	One is indeed freed from old age and death.
1.51.4	They say, "What should be done if the fire-places of one who performs the long sacrifice and offers Agnihotra are united or separated while they are in between? What is the atonement?"
1.51.5	The wheel is indeed the thunderbolt.
1.51.6	The thunderbolt indeed strikes the one between whom and the fires there is a quarrel or who moves away or who moves about.
1.51.7	One should perform the expiation rite. One should also perform the Hestiya sacrifice.
1.51.8	One should not know it thus.
1.51.9	One who establishes the fires indeed follows these worlds.
1.51.10	This world is the Garhapatya fire, the world of the sky is the Anvähäryapacaniya fire, and this world is the Ahavaniya fire.
1.51.11	The birds move freely in these worlds, in the proper and improper places.
1.51.12	He should know that if he goes between the fires, even if it is in his own village, there is no harm or misfortune for him.
1.51.13	There are three domestic animals, the goat, the pig, and the dog, which are not to be sacrificed.
1.51.14	If one of them should die between the two fires, what rite is to be performed there, what expiation?
1.52.1	Some, indeed, go to the Garhapatya fire, dropping a handful of grass, saying, "This Vishnu has wandered," with this verse.
1.52.2	He should not do it in that way.
1.52.3	If someone were to say, "This sacrificer will certainly obtain the (sacrificial) animals, he will soon obtain the animals of his enemies, he will be the most prominent in the house," then it would indeed be so.
1.52.4	One should do it in this way.
1.52.5	Taking the water-pot and the water-vessel, he should take it from the Gārhapatya to the Āhavanīya reciting this verse, "This is Vishnu's stride."
1.52.6	This is the divine purifier.
1.52.7	This is the purifying water.
1.52.8	Whatever is incomplete or impure in the sacrifice, water is the peace of all that.
1.52.9	They appease it with water.
1.53.1	They say, "If the Agnihotra of one who is performing a long sacrifice should be spilled while being milked, what is the rite there? What is the atonement?"
1.53.2	One should offer with whatever remains in the pot.
1.53.3	If the vessel is low or breaks, what is the rite there and what is the expiation?
1.53.4	One should touch it with the expiation for spilling and say, "It has not spilled." If one finds anything else, one should offer with that.
1.53.5	When it spills, then it is deposited.
1.53.6	Semen is the milk, this is the womb.
1.53.7	Herein one establishes the semen in the womb.
1.53.8	Having performed this, the semen is emitted and offspring are born. He who knows this.
1.53.9	From there indeed, Parjanya (the rain-god) scatters (his rain). Here, plants and trees are born.
1.53.10	From the man, semen scatters (to the animals).
1.53.11	From that, this entire creation is born.
1.53.12	He should know that the gods have come to me. May my progeny be more. May I become better.' Thus indeed, it will be.
1.53.13	Then, where it has been spilled, he should place a pot of water or a water-pot, reciting the Vyāhṛtis: "Bhūr Bhuvah Svaḥ."
1.53.14	These Vyāhṛtis are the expiations for all (sins).
1.53.15	Thus he performs the expiation with all this.
1.54.1	Then having collected these potsherds, he should scatter them where the ashes of the Ahavaniya fire have been removed.
1.54.2	This is the only rite here.
1.54.3	Now they say, if the Soma juice were to spill out in front, what would be the rite there, what would be its expiation?
1.54.4	One should offer with whatever is left over in the ladle there.
1.54.5	If the ladle is low or broken, what is the rite there and what is the atonement?
1.54.6	Its touching has been mentioned.
1.54.7	Some indeed, having returned from there, take it up.
1.54.8	One should not do it like that.
1.54.9	If someone were to say, "Since he did not offer the Agnihotra when he intended to do so, it will not be as if it were for heaven," it would be so.
1.54.10	One should do it in this way.
1.54.11	One should sit down wherever one may have stumbled.
1.54.12	Then they should bring a pot, a ladle, and a spoon, and cleanse them.
1.54.13	It is as though he says, "I shall offer it up now."
1.54.14	Then, having offered it up as it was offered, taking a fire-stick, one should go forward.
1.54.15	Just as one would cook one's enemies by rising up against them, in the same way one obtains the oblation by removing the non-returner sin.
1.54.16	Some people say that the Agnihotra-oblation is not offered when they offer with the Agnihotra-remnant, because it is exhausted.
1.54.17	One should not know it thus.
1.54.18	When it is not exhausted, then they make the remnant of this oblation.
1.55.1	They say, "If the Agnihotra of this long-sacrificer, while being offered, becomes impure, what should be done there? What is the atonement?"
1.55.2	Some indeed think that it should be offered, saying, "The gods do not abhor anything."
1.55.3	One should not know it thus.
1.55.4	The man indeed is afraid of the terrible, the terrible gods are afraid.
1.55.5	One should do it in this way.
1.55.6	Having heated the hot ashes of the Garhapatya, one should silently put it there.
1.55.7	It is neither offered nor not offered.
1.55.8	One should sprinkle it with water.
1.55.9	One obtains it through water.
1.55.10	If he finds anything else, he should offer it with that.
1.55.11	Now they say, if milk becomes impure, what is the rite there? What is the atonement?
1.55.12	If he is about to place it on the embers, he should remove them and place it silently on those embers.
1.55.13	It is neither offered nor not offered.
1.55.14	He should sprinkle it with water.
1.55.15	He obtains it through water.
1.55.16	If he finds anything else, he should offer it.
1.55.17	Some say, "If something unclean is placed on it, what is the rite there? What is the atonement?"
1.55.18	If the embers are placed in them, then having removed them, he should silently place it in them.
1.55.19	It is neither offered nor not offered.
1.55.20	When he places it in them, it is offered. When he follows them, it is not offered.
1.55.21	One should follow with water.
1.55.22	He obtains it by means of water.
1.55.23	If he should obtain anything else, he should offer it.
1.55.24	But some say:
1.56.1	If something unclean has been spilled before, what is the rite there? What is the expiation?
1.56.2	Some indeed think that it should be offered, saying that this is for the dead and not for the living.
1.56.3	Now some sprinkle water on it and then sprinkle it.
1.56.4	One should not do it like that.
1.56.5	If someone were to say, "This Agnihotra was sprinkled away, the sacrificer will be sprinkled away," it would be so.
1.56.6	One should do it like this.
1.56.7-11	Having placed the kindling wood on the Āhavaniya fire, having heated the hot ashes of the Āhavaniye fire, he should silently place it in that. That is not offered nor not offered. One should offer it with water. One obtains it with water. Now if one finds anything else, one should offer it with that.
1.56.12	Now they say, if he should have rained, what would be the rite there and what would be the expiation?
1.56.13	He should know that it did not come above, and should say, "May my progeny be more, may I be better." Thus it would be.
1.56.14	Now they say that when the first oblation has been offered, the embers should follow. Where should one offer the second oblation?
1.56.15	One should offer it on the nearest piece of wood that is there.
1.56.16	For Agni is in every house.
1.56.17	If it is not there, one should offer gold.
1.56.18	Now, that which is gold is indeed the seed of Agni.
1.56.19	He who was the father is the son.
1.56.20	Therefore one should offer gold.
1.56.21	But some say:
1.57.1	If the sacrificer dies while the (Soma) is deposited, what is the rite there? What is the atonement?
1.57.2	One should let it drip down after covering it.
1.57.3	This is the rite here.
1.57.4	Now, indeed, this is the atonement for all the sacrificial offerings.
1.57.5	Now, indeed, they say: "If the sacrificer dies while running towards the east, what is the rite there? What is the atonement?"
1.57.6	If the fourfold ladleful that was designated were to be left out, then one should pour it out there.
1.57.7	This is the rite here.
1.57.8	Now they say, if the sacrificer dies when the first oblation has been offered, what is the rite there? What is the expiation?
1.57.9	Some indeed think that it should be offered. They say, "If the first oblation is offered, then the entire Agnihotra is offered."
1.57.10	One should not know it thus.
1.57.11	The dead man does not offer the Agnihotra.
1.57.12	If the four spoonfuls of clarified butter have been duly prescribed, then he should offer it there only.
1.57.13	This is the only rite here.
1.58.1	They say, "If the Agnihotri cow, while being milked, sits down near the Agnihotra of this man who is performing the long sacrifice, what rite should be performed there and what expiation should be done?"
1.58.2	Some of them make her rise with a Yajus.
1.58.3	The Agnihotri cow, when being milked, sits down, showing the sacrificer's sin.
1.58.4	They make her rise with the verse, "The divine Aditi has risen."
1.58.5	Aditi is this earth.
1.58.6	They make it rise for him.
1.58.7	He gives life to the sacrificial thread. He places life in him.
1.58.8	He makes a share for Indra. He places power in him.
1.58.9	For Mitra and Varuna. Mitra and Varuna are indeed the out-breath and in-breath. He places the out-breath, in-breath in him.
1.58.10	When that is offered in that fire, they give it to a Brāhmaṇa, saying, "We are going to be away for a year and will not return. We are placing this sin of non-return on him."
1.59.1	Vājasaneya said, "The cow indeed flees from those who do not believe.
1.59.2	Because they strike him with non-return.
1.59.3	One should do it in this way.
1.59.4	Having obtained the stick, he should raise her up with it.
1.59.5	Just as a horse that is running fast neighs, or a bullock yoked to a cart sits down, and with that stick-driven, whip-driven, he goes to whatever place he wants to go, in the same way, with this stick-driven, and whip-driven, one attains the heaven one desires.
1.59.6	He should make it himself.
1.59.7	He should himself take that glory.
1.60.1	They say, "If the Agnihotra of this long-sacrificer is lost like the Agnihotri's cow, what should be done there? What is the atonement?"
1.60.2	Now Āruṇi said, "The Agnihotra is the sky. Its calf is the sun. The Agnihotra vessel is this earth."
1.60.3	For one who knows this, the Agnihotra does not perish like a calf.
1.60.4	Where would it perish?
1.60.5	For one who has this knowledge, the Agnihotra, when milked, does not spill.
1.60.6	It stands firm in this (earth).
1.60.7	Or, when one knows thus, one sits down to milk the Agnihotra cow.
1.60.8	When she rains well, they say, "She has rained as if sitting down."
1.60.9	But some say, "If she gives blood, what is the rite there? What is the atonement?"
1.60.10	The animal which yields blood is the one that causes the sacrificer to fall back into sin.
1.60.11	Having said, "He goes out," he should cover the Anvāhāryapacana (pot) and say:
1.60.12	Having placed it there and making a ladle, he should cook it.
1.60.13	He should then silently take it back.
1.60.14	Prajapati is not described.
1.60.15	The Agnihotra is the Prajapati.
1.60.16	Then, with the Vyahrtis, "Bhuvah, Bhuvah, Svarah."
1.60.17	These Vyahrtis are the expiations for all.
1.60.18	He performs the expiation with all this.
1.60.19	And they say:
1.61.1	If the fires go away, what is the rite there, what is the expiation?
1.61.2	Some people, however, say that one should perform the churning rite from the firebrand itself, because from where a man's life ends, there he desires the expiation.
1.61.3	One should not know it like this.
1.61.4	One should take the firebrand and move on, for the firebrand is the source of the fire.
1.61.5	One should do it in this way.
1.61.6-8	Having taken it from the Ultmuk, one should churn it on the Aranya. One obtains the desire that one desires, if one churns the Ultmuk and the Aranya. But some say: If the Ahavaniya is taken away, what is the rite there? What is the expiation?
1.61.9	The Garhapatya does not follow him as long as he is not followed.
1.61.10	If he follows him after doing a lot of work, he should again and again take him out.
1.61.11	This is the only rite here.
1.61.12	But some say that if the Garhapatya follows the Ahavaniya when it is taken out, what rite is to be done there and what atonement?
1.61.13	Some of them indeed take it up from there itself, facing east.
1.61.14	One should not do so.
1.61.15	For if someone were to say there, "This is indeed the way the sacrificer's life-breath is being turned away, the sacrificer will die," it would indeed be so.
1.61.16	Some of them indeed take him up from there itself facing west.
1.61.17	The Gārhapatya is the life-breath, the Āhavanīya is the out-breath.
1.61.18	The two breaths, Prāṇa and Apāna, are indeed the food, as they are known to be.
1.61.19	The Garhapatya is indeed the house.
1.61.20	The house is indeed the foundation.
1.61.21	He who would say to him, "This sacrificer will surely die, he will be deprived of his foundation," it would be so.
1.61.22	Some indeed, having churned out the Garhapatya, offer it.
1.61.23	He should not do it like that.
1.61.24	If someone were to say, "He generated fire in the fire, his enemy will be born soon," it would indeed be so.
1.61.25	Some people do it after following that.
1.61.26	He should not do it that way.
1.61.27	If someone were to say, "Whatever was left over, that was not obtained by him, and no one would inherit it," then it would be so.
1.61.28	One should do it in this way.
1.61.29	He should make the fire ascend on the two fire-sticks, "This is thy natural place, the place of sacrifice, from which thou hast risen. Knowing it, O Agni, do thou ascend it. Do thou increase our wealth. Do thou increase us with wealth." Or, "Do thou increase us with song."
1.61.30	He should offer oblations while staying in a hut.
1.61.31	In the case of one who stays in a hut for nine nights, the oblation is offered on both sides of the night, and he does not incur any censure.
1.61.32	He should take out the ashes in the morning, smear them with a lump of dung, and establish the fires as prescribed.
1.61.33	This is the only rite here.
1.62.1	Now they say, if the Ahavaniya fire goes out before being taken out, what is the rite there? What is the expiation?
1.62.2	From this (fire) indeed the Viśve Devas depart, from whose Ahavaniya fire has gone out before being taken.
1.62.3	Having bound the gold with darbha grass, one should take it afterwards.
1.62.4	This is the form of that which shines.
1.62.5	This is indeed the form of the day.
1.62.6	This is made the form of the sun.
1.62.7	Then having kindled the fire, one should take the fire towards the east.
1.62.8	Having taken up the clarified butter in four spoonfuls, he should offer it with the formula, "Svāhā to the Viśve Devas."
1.62.9	Just as one would request a person who is angry and going away to stay with him by means of some agreeable statement or by means of a pleasant abode, in the same way one requests the Viśve Devās.
1.62.10	They all become pleased with him.
1.62.11	Now they say, if the Ahavaniya fire is not taken up,
1.63.1	and the sun rises, what is the rite there? What is the expiation?
1.63.2	From this, indeed, the Visve Devas depart, if the Ahavanīya fire is not carried up and the sun rises.
1.63.3	One should bind a silver piece with darbha grass and carry it in front.
1.63.4	That becomes the form of the moon.
1.63.5	This is the form of night.
1.63.6	This is the form of the night.
1.63.7	Then having kindled the fire, they should take it away.
1.63.8	Having placed it near, having taken four spoonfuls of clarified butter, he should offer with the formula, "To the Viśve Devas svāhā."
1.63.9	Where there is light, there it is here. Knowing this, one should take it.
1.63.10	He is the only relative.
1.63.11	Now, indeed, some say: "Those who see heaven, they offer to the sun."
1.63.12	He who has lost his glory or who is about to be banished from this world should offer to the rising sun.
1.63.13	But some say:
1.64.1	If the fires were to be mixed together, what would be the rite there and what would be the expiation?
1.64.2	If someone else were to burn him beyond that, he should know that the semen has gone beyond. May there be progeny for me, may there be more, may I become better.
1.64.3	It would be so.
1.64.4	If his heart is pierced, he should offer a sacrifice to Agni with the Viviçayesti.
1.64.5	These are the fifteen Samidheni verses, the two Ajyabhāga verses in the Vartrāghna (Sastra), and the two Samyagya verses in Viraj.
1.64.6	Then these are the Yajya and Puronuvakya verses: "The rays of thee, O Agni, are spread in all directions, blown by the wind, pure and shining, moving, of great splendour, divine, of nine kinds, shining in the forest, shining with firmness."
1.64.7	Then the Yajya (hymn) is recited: "O Agni, the human beings praise thee, the knower of the Hotr, the finder of treasures, the one who is in the secret, the auspicious, the all-seeing, the greatly powerful, the well-sacrificing, the one with the glory of ghee."
1.64.8	Then one who is being expelled by sin should offer sacrifice with this (hymn).
1.64.9	One is quickly expelled from sin.
1.64.10	If he were to burn from here, one should offer an Isti to Agni Samvarga.
1.64.11	The same fifteen Sāmidhenī verses, the two Ajyabhāga verses in the Vārtraghna stotra, and the two Samyājyā verses in Viraj metre.
1.64.12	Then these are the Yajya and Anuvākyā verses:
1.65.1	"Do not let us be deprived of this great wealth, like a bearer of burdens, may we attain the union, the wealth."
1.65.2	Then the Yajya of the next one who is in the heaven, he crosses over to the lower one, where I am, that one he knows.
1.65.3	Then if one wishes to destroy one's enemy by means of this (rite), one should perform this sacrifice.
1.65.4	One's enemy is quickly destroyed.
1.65.5	Some say: If one were to take fire from fire, what would be the rite there, what would be atonement?
1.65.6	One should perform the Isti for Agni to Agni.
1.65.7	These are the fifteen Samidheni verses. The two Ajyabhaga verses are for Vartraghna. The two Samyajya verses are Viraj.
1.65.8	Then these are the Yajya and Puronuvakya verses: "Agni is kindled by Agni, the wise, the householder, the young, the bearer of oblations, the one with the ladle."
1.65.9	Then the Yajya (verse) is: "Thou art Agni, O Agni, the Brahman with the Brahman, the friend with the friend, thou art kindled with the kindler."
1.65.10	Then one who desires Brahmic glory should offer this sacrifice.
1.65.11	One indeed becomes lustrous and Brahmic.
1.65.12	Now they say: "If the Ahavaniya and Garhapatya fires were to be mixed, what would be the rite there, what the expiation?"
1.65.13	One should offer a sacrifice to Agni Vīta.
1.65.14	These are the fifteen Sāmidhenī verses. The two Ajyabhāga offerings are to be offered to Vārtraghna. The two Samyājyā offerings are to be to Viśvakarman.
1.65.15	Here are the Yājyā and Anuvākyā verses: "O Agni, come to us for praise, as the giver of oblations. You sit as the Hotṛ on the sacrificial grass."
1.65.16	Then the Yajya: "To him who, for the sake of the gods, kindles the Agni with oblations, to him, O Agni, be peace and gentleness." To him, O Agni be peace and gentleness.
1.66.1	Procreation is light.
1.66.2	Agni is the light of the gods.
1.66.3	The Viraj is the light of meters.
1.66.4	The Viraja is established in Agni.
1.66.5	One attains the Viraja.
1.66.6	Therefore, this is called light.
1.66.7	Two Stotras carry the morning pressing, as do the eye and the breath.
1.66.8	Two Stotra carry the midday pressing, as do hearing and the arms.
1.66.9	Two Stotrs carry the third pressing, as do middle and foundation.
1.66.10	By means of the sound "Hiṃ" the gods placed the light in the Trivṛt (stoma) for the sake of Brahmic splendour.
1.66.11	By means of the Trivṛta (stoma) for Brahmic splendour, they placed the light in Pañcadaśa (stoma) for strength and vigour.
1.66.12	By means means of the Pañcadaśas (stoma) for vigour and strength, they placed the lights in the Saptadaśa (stoma), for progeny, for cattle, for reproduction.
1.66.13	With the seventeenfold progeny, with the animals, with the offspring, they placed the light for the twenty-one-fold establishment.
1.66.14	This is the light that is placed in the Stoma.
1.66.15	Therefore it is called Jyotishtoma.
1.66.16	And because he directs the Stoma towards the Stoma, therefore it is called Jyotiṣṭoma.
1.66.17	Now, when the sacrifice is performed in accordance with the Viraj, it becomes the light of the Viraj. Therefore, it is called the Jyotishtoma.
1.67.1	This sacrifice is equal to a man.
1.67.2	Whatever desire one may have, if one performs this sacrifice, one's desire is fulfilled.
1.67.3	For one goes to the place where one desires to go.
1.67.4	When Prajapati created the creatures, he created them by means of the Agniṣṭoma.
1.67.5	He created them by means means of the Agnișṭoma and the Dasama (stoma) and by means of the Dasama month of the year.
1.67.6	He completed them by means of means of the Agnişṭoma and the Dvādaśa (stoma) and the Dvādasa month of the year.
1.67.7-12	Therefore cattle carry their young for ten months. They are born in the eleventh month. No one carries beyond the twelfth month, for it is taken by that (month). Of those taken, the horse was the most excellent. He took the semen of the horse and put it in the she-mule. That (semen) went to the she-mule, then to the cattle, then to the plants.
1.67.13	Therefore the donkey has two kinds of semen. Therefore the mule has two kinds of seed.
1.67.14	Therefore animals produce two at a time.
1.67.15	Therefore plants grow without being sown.
1.67.16	Therefore an ass should not be given on the sacrificial grass, for it is indeed a non-swimmer, it indeed went beyond, it indeed has two kinds of seeds, it indeed is without offspring.
1.67.17	It should be given at the Stotra of the Sodashin.
1.67.18	The sixteenth (Stoma) is indeed the excess of Stomas, the Asvataras (Stoma) are the excess of animals.
1.67.19	They indeed give that excess to the excess, for the uniformity of the sacrifice.
1.67.20	He who knowing thus sings with the Agnistoma, generates progeny in the proper order, and takes it in the proper order.
1.67.21	The Agnistoma is indeed the foremost sacrifice, the sacrifice of Prajapati.
1.67.22	He who knows this attains the highest and the best.
1.68.1	Indeed, Prajapati was the first to know this.
1.68.2	Indeed, the deity Prajapati is the mind.
1.68.3	He desired, "May I become many, may I beget offspring, may I attain the earth."
1.68.4	He created the Trivrit Stoma from the head, the Gāyatrī metre, the Rathantara Sāman, Agni as the deity, the Brāhmaṇa as the human, and the goat as the animal.
1.68.5	Therefore, the Brāhman is of the Gāyatrī metre, Agni as the Deity.
1.68.6	Therefore, he created the mouth from the mouth, and the mouth is the foremost of the organs.
1.68.7	He desired, "May I be born."
1.68.8	He created the fifteen-fold Stoma with his arms, the Tristubh metre, the Brihat Sama, Indra as the deity, the Kshatriya as the human, the horse as the animal.
1.68.9	Therefore the Kshatriyas have the Tristubh as their metre, Indra as their deity.
1.68.10	Therefore, he performs the Vīrya with the arms, for he created him from the arms and the chest.
1.68.11	He desired, "May I be born."
1.69.1	From the belly itself, he created the Stoma of seventeen, the Jagati metre, the Vamadevya Sāman, the Viśve Devas as the deity, the Vaiśya as the human, the cow as the animal.
1.69.2	Therefore, the Vaishya, desiring the Jagati metre, has the Vishvadev as his deity.
1.69.3	Therefore, the Prajanishnu (the one who generates) was born from the belly, for he was generated from it.
1.69.4	He desired, "May I be born indeed!"
1.69.5	He created the Ekavimsa stoma, the Anushtubh metre, the Yagyayajniya Saman, and the Anushtubha metre, the Anushtup metre, the Yagyajniya Samana, and the Anushthup metre, the Anushthubh metre, the Anushasta metre, the Anushutabh metre, the Anu-shtabh metre, and the Anushasta-shtabh-shtabh metres, and the Anushutabha-shtabh shtabh metres, the Anusha-shtabh shasta-shtabha-shta-shta-shasta-shta-sta-shta metres, and the Anu-shta-shu-shta-ta-ta-shta metres.
1.69.6	Therefore the Shudra has the Anushtubb metre, and the Veshmapati is his deity.
1.69.7	Therefore, he who desires to live should live by means of the feet, for he created him by means of the two feet.
1.69.8	It is by means of this creation that Prajapati created beings.
1.69.9	He who knows this thus, goes to the earth with offspring and cattle.
1.69.10	Therefore, they praise this sacrifice as the most extensive, because it is the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice. This is indeed the sacrifice to Prajapati.
1.70.1	Prajapati distributed energy among the creatures.
1.70.2	That became the Udumbara tree.
1.70.3	Prajapatı was the Udgātṛ.
1.70.4	The Udumbara is related to Prajapati
1.70.5	Other priests are chosen, but not the Udgātā.
1.70.6	When the Udgātṛ priest begins the Udumbara (tree) with the first rite, he chooses himself for the priestly duties with his own deity.
1.70.7	He begins it thus: "I place you in your own abode, in the shade of the Avati tree, in the heart of the ocean, salutations to the ocean, salutings to the ocean, to the sight of the ocean, may I not be deprived of your affection."
1.70.8	When he says, "I place you in the house of Ayus," Ayus is indeed the sacrifice, and this is its house.
1.70.9	"In the shade of the Avati," the Avati is indeed the sacrifice; this is its shade, namely the Sadas.
1.70.10	"In (the house) of the heart of the ocean," the heart is indeed in the middle of the body; therefore the Sadas is made in the middle. The Audumbari is made in the Sadas.
1.70.11-13	"Salutations to the ocean, salutations to the eye of the ocean." The ocean is speech, the eye of the sea is the mind. By these two deities he pays homage when performing priestly duties. "Do not let me be deprived of the Yoni-song." The Yoni-song is the Sama Veda. By this he pays homage to the Sama Veda when performing priestly duties.
1.70.14	He who knows this, and salutes the Samaveda, does not suffer from any common calamity, nor does he suffer from any loss of Samaveda.
1.70.15	He who censures him suffers from calamity.
1.71.1	The Sadas is indeed the belly of Prajapati.
1.71.2	The Udumbara is food.
1.71.3	When the Udumbara is placed in the middle of the Sadas, it places food and strength in the middle of creatures.
1.71.4	Therefore, the food eaten in the middle nourishes.
1.71.5	Therefore, where this is used up, there the people become hungry.
1.71.6	They become nourished.
1.71.7	They debate whether to sprinkle or not to sprinkle.
1.71.8	Everything here is self-existent.
1.71.9	He who desires food from you, he hates most.
1.71.10	If one touches (the water) one would destroy food.
1.71.11	If one does not touch, one would obstruct oneself from food.
1.71.12	Having touched, one sings without touching. One destroys food, and does not obstruct oneself from food.
1.71.13	The food of the gods is the Sama.
1.71.14	The Udumbara is strength.
1.71.15	When the Udgata recites the Udumbari, he places the food of the gods and strength in the Sama.
1.71.16	Therefore, wherever they perform the priestly duties of the Sama, the gods eat there the most.
1.72.1	Prajapati is the Udgata.
1.72.2	The Udumvara is strength.
1.72.3	This Prajapati, abiding in the vital force, distributes food and nourishment to the creatures.
1.72.4	He sings while sitting towards the north.
1.72.5	He thus distributes the vital force towards the northern direction.
1.72.6	He chants while sitting towards the west.
1.72.7	He thus divides the vital force towards western direction.
1.72.8	He responds while sitting towards the south.
1.72.9	He thus distributes the energy towards the southern direction.
1.72.10	The other priests perform their priestly duties facing east.
1.72.11	They thus distribute the energy towards the eastern direction.
1.72.12	Therefore this direction is the most energetic, most nourishing, and most pleasing of all directions.
1.72.13	Therefore, when the creatures are in danger of extinction, they move towards the east.
1.72.14	This is the most worthy of all directions to be supported by the most worthy of the strong. The most are pleased with it.
1.72.15	They say, "The Udgātṛs are devoted to the gods of the eastern direction. Why do they perform their priestly duties in the opposite direction?"
1.72.16	He should say, "For the sake of the desired directions, for the sake of pleasing the directions."
1.72.17	Therefore food is found in all directions.
1.72.18	May it hold up the sky, fill the atmosphere, and firmly support the earth above. May the Maruts, the divine ones, place you on the firm law of Mitra-Varuna. May you delight the heaven and earth with ghee. May the plants be very sweet. Svāhā! He offers the Udumbara twig with this verse.
1.72.19	He anoints these worlds with juice.
1.73.1	Prajapati created the creatures.
1.73.2	He wanted to create Agni from his mouth.
1.73.3	Agni, being disgusted, jumped up from the mouth and created the brain by rubbing it.
1.73.4	The gods and the sages, having approached him, said, "This brain is destroyed. Let it be. We shall do it in whose funeral fire?"
1.73.5	They said to Brihaspati, "Accept Soma in this (house)."
1.73.6	Brihaspati said, "This is indeed cruel, unpurified, impure, and uncooked."
1.73.7	We will make it purified, pure, and cooked."
1.73.8	They said, "Bring it to us."
1.73.9	He said, "So be it."
1.73.10	They gave it to him.
1.73.11	He receives it with the formula, "I receive thee with the impulse of god Savitr, with the arms of Asvins, with the hands of Pusan."
1.73.12	He receives it with the limbs of gods.
1.73.13	The Vasus, having taken it, purify you with the Gayatri metre, for the sake of good progeny, for the sake (of obtaining) wealth. The Rudras purify you with the Tristubh metre, for the purpose of good progeny, (for the sake of obtaining) wealth. The Adityas purify you with the Jagati metre, for the good progeny, for (the sake of obtaining) prosperity.
1.73.14	And with the metres and with the deities he purifies him.
1.73.15	Having purified him, he places the dice behind, saying, "Thou art of Brhaspati, of Vanaspati, the vessel of the head of Prajapati."
1.73.16	When he says, "Thou art Brhaspati," it is because Brhaspati first accepted him.
1.73.17	When he says, "From the tree," they indeed offer it to the trees.
1.73.18	When he says, "from the head of Prajapati," it was indeed the head of Prajapatis.
1.73.19	When he calls it "the vessel of long life," it is indeed the vessel of long life.
1.73.20	The first vessel is yoked, the last is released with it alone.
1.73.21	He who knows this obtains the vessel of the best.
1.73.22	Having placed that last axle, he chants the Gayatri in the Visvarupa verses.
1.74.1	Salutations to the ancestors who have sat before, salutations to those who have sat together.
1.74.2	He yokes the speech with a hundred feet, singing with a thousand wheels, the Gayatri, the Tristubh, the Jagati, all forms collected, the gods have made the places.
1.74.3	"He says, "Salutations to the fathers, the ancient sitters." The fathers indeed sit here first.
1.74.4	He pays salutations to them alone.
1.74.5	He pays homage to those Brahmanas with whom he is going to perform the priestly duties.
1.74.6	He yokes the speech of a hundred feet. He yokes the speech to a hundred feet.
1.74.7	"He sings the thousand-streamed (verse) in the proper order. He sings the thousand-streaming (verse) in its proper order."
1.74.8	"He sings the Gayatri, the Tristubh, the Jagati. These are the three pressing times; he thus takes them into himself."
1.74.9	"All forms are collected. The sacrifice indeed is all forms; he thus collects the sacrifice."
1.74.10	The gods have made the Oṃkāra. Thus he makes the sacrifice along with the gods.
1.75.1	Kusurbindu Hauddalaki recited the Somas.
1.75.2	The sons of the Kasyapas said to him, "Who is this cruel one who recites at the end? We shall recite after him."
1.75.3	They who were to recite it, approached him.
1.75.4	He said, "Let there be salutations to the Brahmanas. Whether it was yesterday or today, I have established the sacrifice in the morning with the Gayatri verse in the Visvarupa (hymn). Just as one would follow a weak and tired cow, so should one follow this sacrificial body."
1.75.5	They rose up and went away, saying, "Salutation to this Brahman! He has done this or that."
1.75.6	He who knows this, his sacrifice is established in the morning in the Gāyatrī verses before the morning recitation.
1.76.1	They say, "O Adhvaryu, what was the praise that the Hotṛ praised in the morning recitation?"
1.76.2	We do not know what is our duty. Ask the Hotṛ."
1.76.3	"The Hotṛ said, "What was sung by the Stotr is being praised by the Prātaranuvāka."
1.76.4	"We do not know what our duty is." He asked the Udgātṛ, "What is sung by the Stotra is being praised by what?"
1.76.5	"What is sung is being praised by Prātaranuvākā."
1.76.6	If he says, "We did not do what we should have done," one should say, "We did what was not to be done."
1.76.7	If they say, "You did what was not light, not what was light," one should say "I did what was light, not what is not light."
1.76.8	Light is what is Rk.
1.76.9	Light is what the Sama.
1.76.10	Light is the deity.
1.76.11	"These are the lights which I have sought. I shall cover you with darkness and sin."
1.76.12	He covers them with darkness and sin.
1.77.1	They sit down facing west.
1.77.2	They thus obtain speech from the mouth.
1.77.3	If they had sat down facing east, they would have made speech their rear.
1.77.4	This is the speech of the gods.
1.77.5	Speech indeed departed from the gods.
1.77.6	It entered the trees.
1.77.7	It is this (speech) that is in the Yakshas.
1.77.8	When they throw down the dice-box and the pot upside down, they thus obtain the divine speech.
1.77.9	The Udgātṛs throw down the dice box and the pot upside-down for the Udgītha.
1.77.10-14	From this very world he drives away the hated enemy. He removes the bright (light) from above. From that very world he drives the hated enemy. He drives away the hated foe from both these worlds, he who knows thus. One should not touch the shadow.
1.78.4	The Rudras then invoked him.
1.78.5	They exerted themselves.
1.78.6	They invoked the Adityas.
1.78.7	The Adityas invoked him.
1.78.8	"The Vasus invoke thee, the Rudras invoke thee, the Adityas invoke thee, with the Gayatri metre, with the Trishtup metre, with the Jagat metre."
1.78.9-13	He thus makes him enter the state of the gods. One may say, "I am offering you in the impulse of the god Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan." He thus offers him with the limbs of the gods. Brihaspati first offered it. He became deficient in form and brilliance.
1.78.14	He thought, "What is the atonement for that?"
1.78.15	He saw it in the cauldron itself.
1.78.16	He touched it, saying, "You are the protector of the body, protect my body; you are the giver of radiance, give me radiance; you are the life-giver, give me life; you are the vigor-giver, give vigor to me."
1.78.17	Whatever part of his body had diminished, he restored it with this.
1.78.18	The Udgātṛ priest touches him with the same formula, "Thou art the protector of the body, protect my body; thou art the sustainer of brilliance, sustain my brilliance; thou art the protector of life, sustain my life; thou art the supporter of strength, support my strength."
1.78.19	Whatever of his body is measured, he makes it grow with the same formula.
1.78.20	Indeed, this Brahman and Ksatra are two.
1.78.21	That is both the Drona pot.
1.78.22	He who knows this, both Brahman and Kshatra are protected.
1.79.1	Having placed the stones in front of him, he touches them with the formula, "The hawks, the unvanquished, the embryos of truth, the hundred-thousand, the destroyer, the mountains, the quarters, do bring to us that hero whom many of us live upon, the one who is not cursed, the one who has done the cursing, the one who does the cursing of another."
1.79.2	He indeed becomes a hero, the accuser of others, not being accused himself, and the accuser of one who is accused.
1.79.3	He places the Drona-pot (on the fire) with the formula, "I place myself on this Brahmanical lustre."
1.79.4	If the king is not present, then having made the Gravas face away, having placed the Dronakalaśa silently, having taken it, he should offer the Dakṣiṇā. He should offer it with the verse, "I am offering this to him. I am making his kingdom fall down." He should offer the Dronakalaša with the verse, “I am offering this.
1.79.5	Having placed the stones in front of him, having taken the name of the king who is there, he should recite the Dronakalaśa thus: "I am reciting this for him."
1.79.6	He is stopped by the one who has gone away, and goes away by the one who is stopped.
1.79.7	If he does not heed him after knowing him, he should desire him thus: "May he be stopped here itself."
1.79.8	Having made the Gravas turn away, having silently taken up the Drona-vessel, having taken up the Upāṃśusavana, he should place the Grava above it, saying, "I am taking this to that village."
1.79.9	The Grava stands in the place where the water has been sprinkled.
1.79.10	If he knows him, he should approach him. This Brahman is indeed in him, but he is not in him. Having placed the ladle in front of him, he should pour the Dronakalaśa (into the ladle) with the verse, "I am pouring this over him."
1.79.11	The gods follow him, and he is enclosed by the gods.
1.80.1	The Drona-vessel is the kingdom.
1.80.2	The pressing stones are the people.
1.80.3	If the Drona-vessel becomes loose, the kingdom becomes loose.
1.80.4	After that the people.
1.80.5	After the people the sacrificer.
1.80.6	After the sacrificer the offspring.
1.80.7	He makes it firm: "May the goddess Dhishana place you in the firm seat, may you sit in the seat of strength."
1.80.8	These indeed are the goddesses Dhishana.
1.80.9	This is the firm seat.
1.80.10	He thus establishes him in those worlds. He settles in strength.
1.80.11	Strength is the rain.
1.80.12	What one does above the rain, that is strength.
1.80.13	He thus obtains that.
1.80.14	Svābhānu, being Asura, enveloped the sun with darkness.
1.80.15	The gods and the sages healed him.
1.80.16	They said to Atri, "O sage, do you remove this."
1.80.17	"So be it," he said.
1.80.18	Atri removed it.
1.80.19	They said, "He who has given us light from those who were pierced by darkness, may his share be light."
1.80.20	This Atri-gold is being taken away.
1.80.21	In ancient times, it was taken away in a hundred measures.
1.80.22	Now, nowadays, they give as much as they can afford.
1.80.23	This indeed is the light in all worlds, namely, gold.
1.80.24	He who, knowing this, gives gold here, gives light in all worlds.
1.81.1	When he removed the first (part), it became black.
1.81.2	When he took away the second (part), it turned smoky.
1.81.3	What was the third, that became Falguni.
1.81.4	He who wishes, "May he be worse," should put black in his purifying ladle. He becomes worse.
1.81.5	He who desires, "May he not be too far nor too near," should put smoke-coloured in his purifying ladle.
1.81.6	Now, if one desires, 'May he be better, may he attain prosperity', one should make his filter of Fālguna grass. He becomes better and attains prosperity.
1.81.7	For there is a fixed place for the sun there too.
1.81.8	Having carried it around in between, he cleanses it with the verse, "May the Vasus cleanse thee with the Gayatri metre, may the Rudras cleanse thee with the Tristubh metre, may the Adityas cleanse thee with the Jagati metre."
1.81.9	He spreads it with the verse beginning with "Udicina dasam" and ending with "Brahmanaspataye pavitram vitatam" for the purpose of completion.
1.81.10	The Tapas is the pure, extended, and divine path. This is for one who desires heaven.
1.81.11	The dawn has shone forth, the speckled one, the first-born. This is for those who desire offspring.
1.81.12	One should extend all of them, for the attainment of all these desires.
1.81.13	He brings the king.
1.81.14	He addresses him with this verse: "Flow on, O Soma, thou art the most radiant, to the dear abodes of the gods. Flow three times for the gods, three times for the Adityas, three times for Angiras. By which fourth Brahman, by which thou flowest for Brihaspati, by that flow for me.
1.81.15	Flow for us, for the cow, for the people, for the horse.
1.81.16	Flow for the plants, O king."
1.81.17	May there be peace for the Udgātṛ, may there be peace for him who offers, may there be pease for the offspring.
1.81.18	The Adhvaryu, while taking up the Āgrayana cup, makes a hissing sound.
1.81.19	That is the hissing sound.
1.81.20	Then the Udgātā sings the Ekārcā hymn, "Thou art exalted above the gods."
1.81.21	He indeed carries the oblation to the gods.
1.81.22	"He pours down the rain from heaven to earth."
1.81.23	He makes these two worlds with their inhabitants.
1.81.24	They make the rain pour down for him as he wishes.
1.81.25	These two worlds make the rain pour for him as he desires, he who knows thus.
1.82.1	"They do something cruel to the sacrifice when they kill Soma, the king, with the stones on the Havirdhāna and then move out to the Bahispavamāna."
1.82.2	What is the atonement for him? They say:
1.82.3	They should sprinkle water.
1.82.4	Water is the peace of everything.
1.82.5	They pacify him with water.
1.82.6	Speech first went to the path without fatigue, and then the Bahispavamāna (chant) moves.
1.82.7	Prajapati said to her, "I will make a share for you, then move."
1.82.8	When about to recite the Bahispavamāna, one should offer a Homa with the verse, "May I be pleasing to speech, pleasing to the lord of speech. O goddess, whatever is sweet in your speech, may that be in me. Svāhā to Sarasvatī."
1.82.9	If one were to offer Homa with the words "Svāhā to Sarasvati," one would be embracing speech and Sarasvati with the Svāhā sound.
1.82.10	Then when he offers with "Svāhā to Sarasvatī," he places the speech in the subsequent Svāhā-offering.
1.82.11	With that speech, he performs the sacrifice, which is not yet taken up.
1.82.12	For the sacrifice is stretched upwards by speech.
1.82.13	One should offer with "You are named Vāg, sent for the divine act, auspicious, well-guiding, true blessing to the sacrificer, svāhā."
1.82.14	Vāg is indeed Vāg.
1.82.15	The Brahman is speech.
1.82.16	Having offered a sacrifice to Brahman in speech, one goes without suffering any harm.
1.83.1	Those who move in the outer Pravargya rite go like those in the forest.
1.83.2	The lord of them may be destroyed by a demon or by some other calamity.
1.83.3	Then he offers the second oblation, saying, "May the god Surya protect me from the heavenly Raksases, the wind from the aerial ones, Agni from the earthly ones. Svāhā!"
1.83.4	He thus gives himself over to the lords of these worlds, and moves about without suffering any harm.
1.83.5	When Prajapati created the sacrifice, he created it in the Havirdhana.
1.83.6	When created, it ran away towards the north.
1.83.7	They praised it when it had come here.
1.83.8	When they praise it after having gone towards the north and having come outside, they praise the sacrifice when it has come.
1.83.9	He who knows the divine Vājin becomes a Vājin.
1.83.10	The sacrifice indeed is the divine steed.
1.83.11	He who mounts the human steed, which is not quiet and not well-tamed, he is indeed injured or destroyed.
1.83.12	But what if one mounts the divine steed, which is quiet and well-tamed?
1.84.1	The Adhvaryu moves forward, carrying the Prastara.
1.84.2	He recites over him, "I am rubbing this divine horse."
1.84.3	He mounts him when he is rubbed and pacified, and does not suffer any harm.
1.84.4	One who chants the Soma approaches the divine field.
1.84.5	If one approaches the field of a human lord without informing him, he may destroy him or let him go.
1.84.6	Now, what if one were to sing without telling the deity of the field?
1.84.7	He says, "Sing Soma, sing Soma."
1.84.8	Soma is indeed the deity of the fields of the gods.
1.84.9	He sings, telling Soma alone, the deity of the gods, the field-lord, and does not suffer any harm.
1.84.10	For me for brilliance, for me for brahmic lustre, for me for food, for me for the earth, for me for nourishment, for me for reproduction of offspring, for the earth of offspring, for nourishment of offspring, for reproduction of offspring. For the kingdom of King Soma, for my dominion.
1.84.11	Grava Sona said to Maitreya, "Shall I come from one or from the other?"
1.84.12	By this he says, "Sing Soma! Sing Soma! This is for him, this is for him."
1.84.13	Those desires are fulfilled for him.
1.84.14	These are the bonds of the gods, when the fires of the Hotṛs are carried away.
1.84.15	He who does not know them and approaches them, releases the bonds of the Gods.
1.84.16	This is the gate of the sacrifice, namely, between the Agnidhra and the Catvala.
1.84.17	One should go through it.
1.84.18	One should come through it.
1.84.19	The altar is called Dha.
1.84.20	When one goes over it, one should say, "You are Dha. Give me nectar. May we live long and be radiant."
1.84.21	One does not release the bonds of the gods, nor does one suffer harm.
1.85.1	They indeed move to heaven through the life-breaths. Having taken the Grahas in the Antah-havirdhana, they move in the Bahispavamana.
1.85.2	They move in a continuous manner.
1.85.3	The world of heaven is like a continuous (stream).
1.85.4	For the uninterrupted continuity of the world of heaven.
1.85.5	They move like a cloud.
1.85.6	The world beyond is like the opposite of this.
1.85.7	Just as the sun, when rising, is seen to be covered by clouds, so is this.
1.85.8	For the attainment of heaven, for the attainment of the world, for the attainment without falling.
1.85.9	The Adhvaryu goes first, the breath of the sacrifice.
1.85.10	Therefore, if they were to be cut off, they would be cut off from the breath, and would become short-lived.
1.85.11	The Prastotar goes second, the mouth of the Saman.
1.85.12	Therefore, if they were to be excluded, they would suffer the greatest calamity.
1.85.13	The Udgātṛ priest moves in the third direction, representing Prajāpati, the deity of all.
1.85.14	Therefore, if they were excluded, they would be conquered by all enemies.
1.85.15	The Pratihartṛ priest moves in fourth direction, representing the fourth part of the Sāman.
1.85.16	Therefore,if they were excluded,they would be deprived of the fourth part of their own self.
1.85.17	The sacrificer moves as the fifth.
1.85.18	The sacrifice is fivefold.
1.85.19	Animals are fivefold.
1.85.20	Therefore, if they were to be excluded, they would be excluded from the sacrifice and animals.
1.86.1	Brahma moves as the sixth.
1.86.2	There are indeed six metres.
1.86.3	By means of the metres, he thus repels the demon, the evil.
1.86.4	Indeed, this entire (universe) is Brahman.
1.86.5	Whatever is after Brahman, that is Brahman. Having removed the evil of the Rakshas, they ascend to heaven.
1.86.6	They ascend, carrying the sacrificial grass.
1.86.7	The sacrificial grass is the sacrificer.
1.86.8	The sacrificial straw is the offspring.
1.86.9	When they carry the sacrificial grass above the sacrificial straw, they place the sacrificer above the offspring.
1.86.10	Therefore the sacrificer is above all other beings.
1.86.11	If he were to worship, the sacrificer would be in heaven and would be cut off from this world.
1.86.12	If he should exceed, he would stand in this world and would be cut from heaven.
1.86.13	They say: "The wife is half the self of the sacrificer.
1.86.14	When it is outside the altar, then it does not cut off this world.
1.86.15	One should approach it.
1.86.16	Or one should not have a wife.
1.86.17	Or if one has a wife, one should approach it, and one should approach something else.
1.86.18	When one approaches it, then one approaches heaven.
1.86.19	When one goes beyond it, then one does not cut off these worlds.
1.87.1	The sun was here first, where this Chaitralya is.
1.87.2	Here is Agni.
1.87.3	He scorched all this.
1.87.4	The gods were afraid of his burning.
1.87.5	They said, "This one will burn everything. Let us protect it by a boundary.
1.87.6	Then he took it with three (verses), with three (verses) he sent it to the atmosphere, with three (verses he sent it) to heaven.
1.87.7	Then it shone forth beyond that.
1.87.8	They saw that supreme syllable.
1.87.9	With that they made it return.
1.87.10	Now it shines forth from here.
1.87.11	With that very syllable they placed Agni in this world.
1.87.12	If the sacrificer desires, 'May I attain the world of heaven', then he should make him sing after having announced the Cātvāla.
1.87.13	They obtain him with three (verses), from the sky with three, and send him to heaven with three.
1.87.14	The sacrificer attains the world of heaven.
1.87.15	One who is about to die becomes master.
1.87.16	For they praise the one who is beyond.
1.87.17	When they all sing, then he should first sing the highest, then the lowest, then the lowest.
1.87.18	All of them are lower.
1.87.19	They say that this is the way to ascend to heaven.
1.87.20	The highest syllable is the one that is not cut off from this world.
1.88.1	They sing the highest verse in the Rathantara mode.
1.88.2	This is the Rathantara.
1.88.3	It is indeed established in this (verse).
1.88.4	Prajapati created the creatures.
1.88.5	They, having been created, surrounded him on all sides.
1.88.6	From them he created food by means of the sound 'Om'.
1.88.7	He stopped what was created by means of the syllable 'Om'.
1.88.8	The Udgata is indeed Prajapati.
1.88.9	All the creatures, the givers of food, surround him on all sides.
1.88.10	He creates food by means of the sound "hiṃ".
1.88.11	He stops what has been created by means of the syllable "oṃ".
1.88.12	If he were to make the sound "hi" and then "oṃ", the food would go away from him.
1.88.13	If one were to recite the Sāman first, one would attain power and strength.
1.88.14	For the Sāman is power.
1.88.15	If one recites the first verse, one attains the strength of the clan.
1.88.16	The verse is for prosperity.
1.88.17	One recites the first Yajus.
1.88.18	Yajus is indeed Brahman.
1.88.19	One thus makes it Brahmanic.
1.88.20	"One says, "Bhūr Bhuvah Svar, I shall do good, I shall generate good, good shall be, good food and nourishment."
1.88.21	What is this, Bhūr Bhuvah Svah, that is indeed Brahman, that is the Yajus.
1.88.22	What is this, I shall do honey, indeed the progeny is honey, he indeed does that.
1.88.23	What is it, I shall generate honey, indeed he generates that.
1.88.24	What will be honey, indeed he makes it reach prosperity.
1.88.25	What is good, good.
1.88.26	Whatever is a man's wealth, that is good. The house is good, the offspring is good, the cattle are good.
1.88.27	He obtains that very thing.
1.88.28	"He says, "Food and strength."
1.88.29	The rain is food.
1.88.30	What is above the rain is strength.
1.88.31	He obtains it.
1.89.1	Having imagined Prajapati, one should sing.
1.89.2	He who, having conceived Prajapati, sings, prospers for him.
1.89.3	The directions, the sub-directions, the intermediate directions, the upper directions, the directions.
1.89.4	Prajapati is the directions.
1.89.5	Having conceived Prajapati he sings.
1.89.6	He prospers for him who knows this.
1.89.7	Bhauvanayana said, "Why do they go to the sacrifice, those who, having eaten the Soma of the gods, either go away or cause it to be taken away?"
1.89.8	When the Bahispavamāna has been recited, one should say to the Brahman whom one considers to be pure, "Today is the day of the hand."
1.89.9	Then he should call him and address him thus: "He who is the drinker of Soma among the gods, he is here in this sacrifice on the sacrificial grass, on the altar. You are eating his share."
1.89.10	If he runs away, or if he does not, then the Soma of the gods has been eaten by him.
1.89.11	The wild animals have their abode here.
1.89.12	Because they chant the Bahispavamāna outside, therefore the animals of the forest go to the forest.
1.89.13	They chant the Parācī verses.
1.89.14	Therefore the animals of the forests go to the forest from the forest.
1.89.15	The Ekārupa verses are chanted.
1.89.16	Therefore the forest animals are of one form.
1.89.17	The last syllable is long.
1.89.18	Therefore, each one is found in a different village.
1.89.19	Then they bring the slain to the village in the forest.
1.89.20	They praise and run away.
1.89.21	They send the sacrificer to heaven.
1.89.22	They seize the arms.
1.89.23	They establish the sacrificer in heaven.
1.89.24	They do that which is untrue, those who lead the mortal to immortality.
1.89.25	They are deprived of beauty and splendor.
1.89.26	He who would rise up from this, let him rise up after him who has risen up.
1.89.27	He is not deprived of beauty and splendour, he does not suffer pain.
1.89.28	One should know the future.
1.89.29	If these creatures were to run away, there would be a running away of the union and protection.
1.89.30	One should know that this is how the Udgātṛ chanted.
1.89.31	If they were to be peaceful, there would be peace of the union and the protection.
1.89.32	One knows that this is how this Udgātṛ has chanted.
1.89.33	This is indeed the knowledge.
1.90.1	One who desires a village, one who desires prosperity, one who desires offspring, should perform the rite with the verse, "We worship him with songs, O men."
1.90.2	Indeed, they sing to this one.
1.90.3	Indeed, everything is in this one.
1.90.4	One who knows this indeed is born with offspring and cattle in this one. One who knows this is born with offspring.
1.90.5	Indeed, men are the classes of gods.
1.90.6	Soma is the kshatriya class.
1.90.7	One who performs this rite indeed obtains both the classes and the kshatriya.
1.90.8-12	"He worships the god with the formula, 'I worship the god.' All these deities are worshipped without any obstacle. One desiring offspring should perform the Pratipada rite with the formula, "The one born in the water is near." Indeed, offspring are near to the self. One is born with offspring and cattle near to the self.
1.90.13-19	For this is the meaning of the word "aptur": he becomes better, more prosperous than his own self. "Purified by cows," it says. The sacrifice is purified by cows. Animals are purified. He thus wins both the sacrifice and animals. "The gods sought the moon," it says. The sacrificer is the moon, the king.
1.90.20	The Stomas are the gods.
1.90.21	The Stomas indeed lead him to the heavenly world.
1.91.1	One desiring preeminence should perform the first step with the verse, "Flow forth, O Soma, the foremost of speech."
1.91.2	Prajapati created the creatures.
1.91.3	They, being created, did not obey him.
1.91.4	He desired, "May I attain preeminence among these creatures."
1.91.5	He saw this first step.
1.91.6	By her he was praised.
1.91.7	Then he attained the best of his progeny.
1.91.8	He who knows this goes to the best of his own.
1.91.9	This indeed is the prosperous Stotriya, whose beginning is "Flow for me."
1.91.10	By the prosperous Stotriyas, his praise becomes accomplished.
1.91.11	He who understands the divine pair, is born with the pair.
1.91.12	And the speech is Pavasa and Vaichi, this is the divine pair.
1.91.13	He who knows this is born with the pair.
1.91.14	This is the beginning of all three Sama-s: Pavasa for Vamadevya, Vaichi for Rathantara, Agriya for Brihat.
1.91.15	The praise is the beginning of these Sama-s.
1.91.16	Soma with variegated powers.
1.91.17	Soma indeed is the variegated one of the gods.
1.91.18	By means of Soma, the variegated one of gods, one becomes many and is born.
1.91.19	"He recites, 'I praise all the songs.'
1.91.20	He thus obtains all the songs.
1.92.1	One who desires to be established in the people should recite the verse, 'Flow, O Soma, the bull, the poured one,' at the beginning.
1.92.2	For this is his verse, 'Make us the people of fame.' Thus he becomes the people of fame.
1.92.3	"The bull is the son."
1.92.4	He who succeeds in it becomes like a bull, like a begetter, like a lord among the people.
1.92.5	He who knows this becomes like a bull and like a begetter and like a lord among those people in whom he succeeds.
1.92.6	Everyone indeed desires to prosper and to overcome his enemies.
1.92.7	"Destroy all your enemies."
1.92.8	By this he conquers all his enemies.
1.92.9	One who is about to engage in battle should recite the verse, "Flow with that, O Pavamana, that which is to be held," as the first verse.
1.92.10	"By which the cows have come here, the daughters, to our homes."
1.92.11	He who engages in battle desires to win the cows.
1.92.12	He wins the cows.
1.92.13	One who intends to go to war should recite this verse as the first verse.
1.92.14	The one who goes to a sacrifice is indeed taking away the cattle of the sacrificer.
1.92.15	The one who knows this, the cattle of the Sacrificer follow him.
1.92.16	One should recite the verse "O Agni, do thou purify the life" for one suffering from a disease.
1.92.17	His body indeed goes to Agni, his breath to Vayu.
1.92.18	He indeed joins his body with Agni's purifying breath and his breath.
1.93.3	By Agni alone one becomes endowed with the Brahman of the gods.
1.93.4	One should perform this very step when practising sorcery.
1.93.5	Agni is the Brahman of the Gods.
1.93.6	By Agni alone one afflicts the one whom one hates with the Brahman of gods.
1.93.7	One who desires food should perform this very same step.
1.93.8	"He (the sacrificer) obtains the good and the bad" - thus he obtains the good and bad by this (verse).
1.93.9	One who is being attacked should make this the first step.
1.93.10	He who attacks, he who causes to attack, he who desires evil, he is indeed the wicked one.
1.93.11	"Oare, Oare, Oare! Destroy the wicked!" By this he repels his hated enemy, the wicked one, from below.
1.93.12	One who desires Brahmic glory should recite the first verse, "The shining one flashes forth."
1.93.13	The Gāyatrī shines forth.
1.93.14	The Gāyatri is Brahmic glory.
1.93.15	The Tristubh is strength and valour.
1.93.16	The Jagatī is procreation.
1.93.17	He who knows this becomes endowed with brahmic glory, strength, and energy, and is born with offspring and cattle.
1.93.18	The Soma-pressers are pressing the Soma, the bright, at the head of the cattle.
1.93.19	The Somas are indeed the sacrifice.
1.93.20	The cattle are at the head of cattle.
1.93.21	By this he wins both the sacrifice and cattle.
1.93.22	He should recite the verse, "May I shine with the ancient glory of his father," if his father or grandfather were better off. If he thinks himself inferior to them,
1.93.23	he attains the glory of his father and grandfather.
1.93.24	"The bright one milked the cow,"
1.93.25	the sacrifice is the bright one,
1.93.26	the cattle are the cow.
1.94.3	He makes them equal in form with the metre.
1.94.4	They come to the blessing of the sacrifice.
1.94.5	When Prajapati created the creatures, he created them with this very (metre).
1.94.6	He created the gods with the word "e" (Oṃ), the men with the word "asrigra", the ancestors with the word "indava", the planets with the word "tiras pavitra", the Stotras with the word "ashva", the praises with the word "vishvani", and the praises with the words "abhi saubhage". Thus, the born ones are praised with auspiciousness.
1.94.7	Indeed, he who knows this and sings with this formula, he is indeed Prajapati, creating beings.
1.94.8	Then indeed, he anoints them with good fortune.
1.94.9	One should make the first verse of the three who are performing together as "The Soma-pressed ones have flowed forth."
1.94.10	He makes them equal sharers in the form of the Chanda.
1.94.11	They come to the blessing of the sacrifice.
1.94.12	"The Soma-pressed cows and horses," he makes them obtain cattle and horses.
1.94.13	"The semen is the bright, the offspring is the heroic."
1.94.14	The sacrifice is bright.
1.94.15	The offspring is heroic.
1.94.16	He thus obtains for them both the sacrifice and offspring.
1.94.17	"One should use the formula, 'You are the lords of heaven,' for two persons who are performing a joint sacrifice."
1.94.18	He makes them both equal in form through the metre.
1.94.19	They both attain the blessing of the sacrifice.
1.95.1	Indra and Soma, the protectors of the Soma, the lords, may they nourish the mind.
1.95.2	Indra and Soma desired to attain lordship over all creatures.
1.95.3	They saw this formula.
1.95.4	By it they attained.
1.95.5	Then they attained lordship over all creatures.
1.95.6	He who recites this hymn attains the lordship and sovereignty of his own people.
1.95.7	One who is related to a king should recite the verse "Indra, O Indra, to the Maruts" as the first verse.
1.95.8	The king is related to Indra.
1.95.9	The people are related to Maruts.
1.95.10	They make the people follow the king.
1.95.11	Therefore, the people follow the authority of the king.
1.95.12	He who conquers and is not conquered by others.
1.95.13	He conquers and is conquered by none.
1.95.14	He slays the enemy by attacking him.
1.95.15	He slavs the enemy by attacking from another side.
1.95.16	The enemy does not attack him in return.
1.95.17	He flows on, O thou of a thousand conquests.
1.95.18	He who conquers all, conquers all.
1.95.19	He who has conquered all, conquers everything.
1.95.20	He who praises with this formula, may he be victorious.
1.96.1	One should perform the Pratipada for one who is being cursed, saying, "He blows away evil."
1.96.2	Those who curse him are indeed associated with evil.
1.96.3	Evil is destroyed, evil is destroyed.
1.96.4	"Soma is free from evil,"
1.96.5	Those who curse are indeed associated with him as if with evil.
1.96.6	Going, he recites the formula, "Indra's deed."
1.96.7	He who is accused becomes one without senses, like a non-divine being.
1.96.8	By this (rite) they make him one with senses and divine.
1.96.9	One suffering from a disease or a chronic disease should perform the rite of Agni-Varuna.
1.96.10	One who is suffering from a disease, a chronic disease, is seized by Agni and Varuna.
1.96.11	They release him through Agni from the Agniya (sins), through Varuna from the Varunya (sins).
1.96.12	One who wishes to bring in the youngest verse, should make the youngest verse the first, in which the verses are smaller and smaller.
1.96.13	He who is younger seeks the smaller. The smaller seeks the younger.
1.96.14	He who knows thus, obtains the younger through the smaller.
1.96.15	"This is the immortal god." One should recite this verse if one desires, "May I alone be the best among my kinsmen and may I attain prosperity."
1.96.16	He addresses them as "this, this" for the sake of seniority and supremacy.
1.96.17	One becomes the best among one's kinsmen and attains prosperity.
1.96.18	The Lord is indeed the other one in the progeny, the hero who is born from the unborn.
1.96.19	It is he alone, not different from him, that speech addresses as 'this'.
1.96.20	But it is not so.
1.96.21	One says, 'The god is immortal.'
1.96.22	And he who has a hero, a heroic son, is both a god and mortal.
1.96.23	Then indeed that very god, that very immortal, from whom a hero is born to a hero, to a heroic man.
1.96.24	A hero is born to the heroic man, to a heroic and powerful man; he is united with offspring, not cut off.
1.97.1	The gods and the Asuras contended.
1.97.2	The gods created the thunderbolt, sharp-edged, in the form of a man.
1.97.3	They conquered the Asuras with it.
1.97.4-9	He defeated the Asuras and turned back the gods. Therefore the gods were afraid. He attacked them and divided them into three parts. He stood up only after being divided into three parts. They looked at him after starting from him. The gods saw the Chandas in the man who had entered.
1.97.10	They said, "The gods have entered this man in the form of the Vedas.
1.97.11	He will come to us in this world after having lived a virtuous life, having performed sacrifices, having practised austerities, and having done good deeds."
1.97.12	They said, "Let us do it in such a way that he does not come to us."
1.97.13	Let us assign sin to him.
1.97.14	Therefore they have made this evil one to be the messenger.
1.98.1	Sleep, laziness, anger, hunger, desire for gambling, and desire for women.
1.98.2	These evils follow a man in this world.
1.98.3	He who has crossed this Agni and desires to do good in this world, you have placed him in this world, desiring knowledge. They placed Agni in this world, Vayu in the atmosphere, and Aditya in heaven.
1.98.4	Ugradeva said, "I do not fear any human being, except those who have heard from him the three best gods."
1.98.5	"He who knows that these deities do not fear him, he is not feared."
1.98.6	And indeed, these deities do not harm him who knows this.
1.98.7	Then indeed they desire him who knows thus, 'He who knows thus desires me.'
1.98.8	Those gods said, 'Those very deities who have entered the man in the form of the metres, with them we shall conquer the Asuras.'
1.99.1	They protected their life with the Gāyatrī, the eye with the Tristubh, the ear with the Jagatī, and the speech with the Anushtubh.
1.99.2	From this world he keeps them away by the Gāyatrī, from the middle world by the Tristubh, from the upper world by the Jagatī, from the cattle by the Anushtubh.
1.99.3	He keeps them away from all.
1.99.4	Then indeed the gods became victorious over the Asuras.
1.99.5	He becomes victorious over his enemy, his foe becomes defeated, he who knows thus.
1.99.6	What the gods hurled at the Asuras, that is the hurling.
1.99.7	He hurls his hateful enemy who knows thus.
1.99.8	When Prajapati created the beings, he created them with the hurling.
1.99.9	The semen he sprinkled with the semen-sprinkling.
1.99.10	He united the breath with the Gayatri, the eye with the Tristubh, the ear with the Jagati, and the speech with the Anushtubh.
1.99.11	He himself placed the verse.
1.99.12	Indeed, Prajapati, having become the beings, creates the beings. He who knowing thus sings with the verses.
1.100.1	He sings in the semen.
1.100.2	He sprinkles that semen.
1.100.3	He sings as if continuously.
1.100.4	Indeed, semen is as if continuous.
1.100.5	He sings, as if, in secret.
1.100.6	Indeed, the semen is as if secret.
1.100.7	One should not touch the fire.
1.100.8	If one touches the verse, one would cut off the semen.
1.100.9	One sings three Udasas.
1.100.10	One takes up the breath with the first Udasa, the out-breath with the second, and the through-breath with the third.
1.100.11	One sings the three Udasas:
1.100.12	One takes up oneself with the first Udaśa, one's wife with the second, one's offspring with the third.
1.100.13	He sings the Triyudasa.
1.100.14	He ascends this world with the first Udasa, the intermediate world with the second, and the world of heaven with the third.
1.100.15	He who knowing thus sings the Triyudasas, conquers the world of his enemies.
1.100.16	He who wishes to conquer the world of his enemy should sing the Dvyudasas.
1.100.17	The enemy of this one is defeated, and he attains prosperity for himself.
1.100.18	But one who is in control is not likely to die prematurely.
1.100.19	One goes from the vital airs to the three-day-long (ritual).
1.100.20	One should desire it in such a way that one lives out one's entire life.
1.100.21	One should seek the world of one's enemy by another means.
1.100.22	One should sing the three Udasas, and not make a hissing sound.
1.100.23	If one makes a hissing sound, then by the hissing sound of the thunderbolt, one would cut off semen.
1.101.1	They say, "By the hissing sound, indeed, Prajapati created food for the offspring."
1.101.2	If one does not make a hissing noise, then the offspring would be without food.
1.101.3	"He should only make the sound 'hiṃ' (i.e. 'hum')", so says the Veda. "He who makes the sound 'hi' is the giver of life, for 'hi' means 'life'."
1.101.4	By making the sound 'hi', one does not cut off the semen, and one does not transgress the sound 'hi'.
1.101.5	Some say that semen is more gentle than the sound 'hi'."
1.101.6	One should cut it off even with a blade.
1.101.7-12	At the time of the Hiṃkāra, one should mentally contemplate the Hiṃkāara. It does not spill the semen, nor does it go beyond the Hiṃkāāra. He concludes with "Bhūr." When Prajapati first spoke, he spoke only "Bhūr." He created this (earth). He created this (earth) when he spoke "Bhūr." When one concludes with "Bhūḥ," one establishes the semen in this (earth).
1.101.13	Then indeed he makes it reach that prosperity.
1.102.1	He chants the Gayatri.
1.102.2	The Gayatri is indeed the breath.
1.102.3	Of that he places two syllables in between.
1.102.4	He places the exhalation and inhalation in between.
1.102.5	Therefore the exhalation and the inhalation are placed in between, and the creatures move along them, coming and going without fatigue.
1.102.6	He makes the final syllable "sat" (be).
1.102.7	Prāṇa is indeed Sat.
1.102.8	It indeed stands firm in Prāṇa itself.
1.102.9	He sings the Tristubh.
1.102.10	The Tristubh is indeed the eye.
1.102.11	It has two syllables that illuminate.
1.102.12	He places the eyes there.
1.102.13	Therefore the eyes are as if joined.
1.102.14	He makes the concluding verse, "Jyotiḥ."
1.102.15	The eye is indeed Jyotiḥ.
1.102.16	It is established in the eye itself.
1.102.17	He sings the Jagati.
1.102.18	The Jagati is indeed the ear.
1.102.19	It illuminates four syllables for it.
1.102.20	He establishes it in the ear itself.
1.102.21	There are two hearing and two listening in the ear.
1.102.22	Therefore, he hears all directions from the same place.
1.102.23	Even if one hears what is said from behind.
1.102.24	He makes the sacrifice end with the Ida.
1.102.25	The Ida is the cattle.
1.102.26	He thus finds support in the cattle.
1.102.27	She sings the Anushtubh.
1.102.28	The Anushtubh is speech.
1.102.29	She sings it, driving it forward, for the non-departure of speech.
1.102.30	If she were to sing it, driving it away, speech would depart from him.
1.102.31	When he sings the verse that is later than that, he establishes speech in himself.
1.102.32	He sings the verse that has a meaning and that which does not have a meaning.
1.102.33	They enjoy speech through the verse that has meaning. The verse that does not have a meaningful is what is to be enjoyed.
1.102.34	He enjoys speech and sustains it. He who knows this.
1.102.35	If he were to sing only the Vedic verses, then the people would speak and not be silent.
1.102.36	If he were to sing the non-Vedic verses, then the creatures would be silent and not speak.
1.102.37	Because he sings both the Vedic and non-Vedic words in the verses, therefore the creatures speak and are silent.
1.102.38	He concludes with the word "speech".
1.102.39	Speech is indeed Brahman.
1.102.40	That indeed, O Brahman, is established in speech.
1.102.41	He sings the Panchati (verse).
1.102.42	The Panchati (verses) are the seasons.
1.102.43	It has six syllables.
1.102.44	There are six seasons.
1.102.45	It is established in the seasons.
1.103.1	They say, "They make it equal to the metres, when at the morning pressing, all the metres are sung in the Gāyatrī metre. The offspring of those who know this become prosperous."
1.103.2	He who desires, "May my offspring be peaceful and prosperous," should not sing the Dhurva.
1.103.3	If the sacrificer were to perform a sacrifice without the head, he would accept the sacrificial gifts with falsehood.
1.103.4	The sacrificer gives the sacrificial gifts, saying, "Do not do harm to the Brahman."
1.103.5	He should act accordingly so that the sacrificer does not perform a sacrifice without his head and does not accept the sacrificial gifts falsely.
1.103.6	One should sing separately.
1.103.7	He who wants to conquer you, but is unable to conquer, meets with misfortune.
1.103.8	If one is unable to conquer the semen, one becomes semenless. The semenless embryos are born.
1.103.9	If one cannot conquer the Gayatri, one becomes a killer. The dead embryos are born.
1.103.10	If one is unable to chant the Tristubh, one becomes blind. The foetus becomes blind.
1.103.11	If one is unable to recite the Jagati, one becomes deaf. The foetus also becomes deaf.
1.103.12	If one cannot chant the Anushtubh, one becomes tongue-less. The foetus is also tongue-less.
1.103.13	If one is unable to separate the lines, the seasons are attracted.
1.103.14	He who hopes to separate them should sing them in a hidden form.
1.103.15	Both are sung in the form of the sun.
1.104.1	When the Gayatri is being sung, one should sing the Gayatri and mentally go to the earth.
1.104.2	One should breathe in and out.
1.104.3	He makes the final verse with the word "good".
1.104.4	He sings it in a hidden form.
1.104.5	When the Tristubh is sung, he should sing the Gayatri with his mind going to the atmosphere.
1.104.6	He should look with his eyes.
1.104.7	He makes the final verse as "light".
1.104.8	He sings her in a hidden form.
1.104.9	When the Jagati is being sung, he should sing the Gayatri, and should mentally go to the directions and animals.
1.104.10	He should listen with his ears.
1.104.11	He concludes with the word "Ide".
1.104.12	He sings it in a hidden form.
1.104.13	When the Anushtubh is being sung, one should sing the Gayatra, and should mentally ascend to heaven.
1.104.14	Singing with the voice, he sings with the voice.
1.104.15	He sings it in a hidden form.
1.104.16	When the group of five is sung, he should sing the Gayatri verse and mentally go through the seasons.
1.104.17	He sings in a hidden form,
1.104.18	He sings the last verse in the form of "Oṣam".
1.104.19	This verse is indeed generative.
1.104.20	He who knows this is born with offspring and cattle.
1.104.21	When Prajapati created the creatures, he created them with this very three-fold (verse).
1.104.22	"He created the creations of Pavamana, the wise, the strong, saying, 'The creations of Pavamāna, the wise, are created.' He created them by saying, 'The creation of Pavamāna is created.'
1.104.23	He created them by saying 'The creation of the imperishable one is created.'
1.104.24	When they were created, he was afraid of their destruction.
1.104.25	He saw this highest (river) flowing towards the sea.
1.104.26	With that he surrounded the sea completely with the verse, "You are the moon in the sea."
1.104.27	They did not go beyond him.
1.104.28	His wealth does not go beyond him, for one who knows this.
1.104.29	One reaches the source of truth.
1.104.30	The house is indeed the source of truth.
1.104.31	The creatures born from this imperishable, eternal Brahman go and do not go.
1.105.1	The gods and the demons were contending for these worlds in this Bhuvana.
1.105.2	The gods desired, "We shall conquer these worlds, conquer the Asuras, and overcome our rivals."
1.105.3	They saw these oblations and praises.
1.105.4	They praised with them.
1.105.5	They conquered these worlds.
1.105.6	He conquered this world with the Agniya (verse), the intermediate world with the Maitravaruni (verse), the heaven with the Indra (verse), and the directions with the Indra-Agni (verse).
1.105.7	That by which they conquered these worlds, that is the reason why the Ajyapas are called Ajyapas.
1.105.8	He who knows this conquers these worlds, conquers his rival, conquers his enemy.
1.105.9	Those gods said, "Let us worship the Vimanis."
1.105.10	They did not distribute them equally.
1.105.11	They said, "Let's make a race with them, making a mountain of wood."
1.105.12	Because they said, "Let there be a race with them," that is their second status as Ajyas.
1.105.13	Because they made the mountain a wood, therefore that mountain is called Kāṣṭha.
1.106.1	After them were born the others.
1.106.2	Among them Agni first rose up, then Mitra-Varuna, then Indra.
1.106.3	Then there was one who rose up last.
1.106.4	Indra knew, "Agni will rise up here."
1.106.5	He said, "O Agni, whoever of us two wins, let him be with you."
1.106.6	"So be it," said Agni.
1.106.7	Agni won.
1.106.8	Then they were together, half of one's praise and half of the other's.
1.106.9	The sacrifice is Indra-Agni.
1.106.10	He who knows thus the victory of these gods, wherever he wishes to conquer, he conquers there.
1.106.11	They say, "All the oblations are of the same end. By what is the non-oblation done?"
1.106.12	One should say, "By the oblations of different deities." That is the non-offering.
1.106.13	Or one should say, "Because they are of different forms." That is the offering.
1.106.14	These are indeed the animals.
1.106.15	Because they praise the animals that are within the house, therefore the domestic animals are within the village.
1.106.16	Again, they turn back from the distant ones.
1.106.17	Therefore the domestic animals turn back from the distance in the morning and return in the evening.
1.106.18	They praise in different forms.
1.106.19	Therefore the domesticated animals are of different forms.
1.107.4	Agni said, "I have seen how to conquer this."
1.107.5	They said, "Tell us that."
1.107.6	He said, "Having placed everything in the imperishable, we should join the yoke to the yoke."
1.107.7	What he said, "By means of the imperishable alone, having placed everything on the yoke, I shall join the yoke of the yoke," that is the yoke of ghee, the state of being a yoke of ghee.
1.107.8	He, by means of the imperishables alone, having placed all this on the yoke, joined the yoke of the yokes.
1.107.9	He conquered them.
1.107.10	He who knows thus conquers his rival, the one who hates, the one who competes.
1.107.11	If he sings the other verse, then he should sing the verse about the ghee.
1.107.12	He who, knowing this, says in a battle that is about to begin, "I am placing you with the imperishable one," he wins that village.
1.107.13	And the village in which there is a person who knows this, that village also wins.
1.107.14	Those gods said, "Let us worship the Vimanis."
1.107.15	They did not distribute them equally.
1.107.16	They said, "Let's make a race for them, a mountain of wood."
1.107.17	Because they said, "Let there be a race for them," that is their second consecration.
1.107.18	Because they made a mountain of wood, that mountain is called "wood mountain".
1.108.1-5	All of them were created at once. Among them Agni alone rose up. When he had gone away, his chariot-wheel fell down and rolled around with its axle-end. They said, "Having seen him, he will be either the best eater or the one whose sin will roll around."
1.108.6	He who, knowing this, turns it around, becomes the best eater of food among his own people.
1.108.7	And then they turn that evil one around.
1.108.8	That Agni fled, having been praised.
1.108.9	Indra said to him, "Let us be together."
1.108.10	He said, "No."
1.108.11	Or, what one householder wins, all of them win together. Let it be together, not separately.
1.108.12	He said, "No!"
1.108.13	"Look at me!" he said.
1.108.14	He looked at him.
1.108.15	He said: "You looked at me for conciliation. It was not together."
1.108.16	"Whatever I look at, that will be with me."
1.108.17	He replied, "No, you looked at me for the sake of conciliation, but it was not with me."
1.109.1	They are the ones who ask questions.
1.109.2	They asked Prajapati.
1.109.3	He, Prajapati, said, "You have looked at him with conciliation. You two have become one."
1.109.4	"So be it," he said.
1.109.5	Then they became one, half of one's praise and half of the other's.
1.109.6	The sacrifice is Indra-Agni.
1.109.7	Those two, Mitra and Varuna, the out-breath and in-breath, fled from the cattle, thinking, "The cattle will be breathing through us."
1.109.8	Those cattle, not breathing, were panting.
1.109.9	Then they told this to Mitra and Varuna, the two gods of breath and out-breath, who had gone away from the animals. They lay down, panting, without breathing.
1.109.10	They (Mitra and Varuna) quickly said, "Let our animals breathe through you two."
1.109.11	They said, "Not through us both."
1.109.12	They decided on this Maitrāvaruṇa oblation.
1.109.13	Then indeed, through them, cattle became alive.
1.109.14	He who knows this Agni's Ujjiti, wherever he desires, "May I conquer here," he conquers there.
1.109.15	He who indeed knows this Indra's Arditi, wherever he desires "May I be a sharer," he becomes a sharer there.
1.109.16	He who knows this, the protection of Mitra and Varuna, wherever he desires, "May it be so here," it is so for him there.
1.110.1	All these are indeed Indra-Agni-related, since they are related to Agni.
1.110.2	They praise in the Agni-related verses. Therefore, it is Agni-related.
1.110.3	The Gayatri metre. Therefore, it belongs to Agni.
1.110.4	The Stoma is fifteen; thereby the Indra-like.
1.110.5	They chant the Indra-Agni-like in the Maitravaruni verses; thereby the Maitravaruna-like.
1.110.6	The Gayatri metre; thereby the Agni-like.
1.110.7	 The Stoma is five-teen; thereby the Indra like.
1.110.8	They chant in the Indra-like verses; thereby the Indra -like.
1.110.9	The Gāyatri metre; thereby Agni-like.
1.110.10	The Stoma is fifteen; thereby Indra.
1.110.11	They praise Indra-Agni with this (Stoma) which is Indra-Agni. Thereby Indra-Agni (is praised).
1.110.12	The Gayatri metre; thereby Agni.
1.110.13	The Stoma is fifteen, thereby Indra.
1.110.14	This is Indra-Agna.
1.110.15	Indra-Agni are the deities of the sacrifice.
1.110.16	Herein, at the morning pressing, they establish the sacrifice in the deity itself.
1.111.1	Prajapati created the creatures.
1.111.2	They were born without breath.
1.111.3	He gave breath to them with this very hymn.
1.111.4	Breath indeed is the Gayatri.
1.111.5	He who knows this attains the whole span of life.
1.111.6	They, seeking breath, followed the Raksases.
1.111.7-12	They sang this very same Sama. He sang and stretched out. That is why the Gayatri is called Gayatri. He who knows this is protected from all evil. The singing is like that above. The heavenly world is above. It is for the attainment of the heavenly world. The singing has three repetitions.
1.111.13	These three worlds are for the attainment of these worlds.
1.111.14	The Geya is recited three times.
1.111.15	There are three kinds of breath: prāṇa, apāna, and vyāna. For their continuity.
1.111.16	For him, the prāṇa, the apāna, and the vyāna flourish, for one who knows this.
1.111.17	The Geva is recited three times
1.111.18	These three worlds are for continuity of these worlds. 
1.111.19	For him, these worlds flourish, for one knows this.
1.112.1-6	They say that one should not go to the one who is devoted to the ancestors. This is his devotion to the ancestors, when he makes the Tantikara. If one is afflicted by a disease, one should recite the middle of the verses. The verse is the breath. The Gāyatrī is the breath. Here he brings the breath to the middle of the breath.
1.112.7	If one were to go to the Rg Veda, one should sing the Prāṇa, Apāna, and Vyāna.
1.112.8	"Prāṇa" has two syllables.
1.112.9	"Apāna" has three syllables.
1.112.10	"Vyāna" has three.
1.112.11	That makes eight.
1.112.12	The Gāyatrī has eight syllables.
1.112.13	Thus it goes to the Gāyatrī.
1.112.14	The Sāman does not go beyond the forest.
1.112.15	He who knows the forest within the Samaveda, conquers all enemies or is conquered by them.
1.112.16	This is the forest within the Sāman, namely, the Prāstara which is not sung in tune.
1.112.17	One should sing it in tune.
1.112.18	This is indeed the own of the Sāman.
1.112.19	By means of its own, one makes it complete.
1.112.20	This is the food of the Saman, namely, the Svaras.
1.112.21	He thus makes it prosper with food.
1.112.22	This is the abode of the Saman namely, the Svarus.
1.112.23	He thus causes it to prosper with an abode.
1.112.24	This is a dear abode of the Samans, namely, the svaras.
1.112.25	He causes it to prosper by a dear abode.
1.113.1	The oblation of the sacrifice did not reach the gods.
1.113.2	Prajapati thought, "How can the oblation of the sacrificial offering reach the gods?"
1.113.3	He extracted these two syllables from the Gāyatrī.
1.113.4	That became the two-syllabled Vasat-call.
1.113.5	Then the oblation of sacrifice reached the gods.
1.113.6	That is food, the Vasat-call.
1.113.7	He who knows this, eats food.
1.113.8	Indra hurled the thunderbolt at Vritra.
1.113.9	These two syllables were on it.
1.113.10	This is indeed the thunderbolt.
1.113.11	He who touches these (syllables) touches the thunderbolt.
1.113.12	One who approaches milk from milk does not grow.
1.113.13	But he who approaches milk from non-milk grows.
1.113.14	He who recites these two syllables approaches the milk from the milk.
1.113.15	Therefore, one should not recite these two syllables.
1.113.16	For him, whose Gāyatrī is recited in its entirety, everything is obtained in his house.
1.113.17	For him whose Gāyatri is not recited, he becomes poor and rough.
1.113.18	One should recite the speech of twenty-four syllables, having grasped either of the two syllables.
1.113.19	His (the Brahman's) Gāyatrī is not sung, nor does it touch (anything).
1.114.1	He who sings the Anśu, the one-syllabled Veda, becomes the best of his own people.
1.114.2	And he sings for that very community.
1.114.3	Speech is the Anśu (the one-syllable), the one-syllabic Veda.
1.114.4	That itself is the Gāyatrī.
1.114.5	The syllable after the beginning of the Gāyatrīs that are being chanted is the Standing One.
1.114.6	He who begins to chant it, begins with the immobile.
1.114.7	He who carries it away, makes the Gayatri incomplete.
1.114.8	The sacrifice flows after the incomplete Gayatri, the sacrificer after the sacrifice, the offspring after the sacrificer.
1.114.9	Saddhasva, son of Taigmaya, said, "Who will be lying down today on the chest of the one who is here?"
1.114.10	These indeed are the two who are the givers of juice, those who are in the last syllable of the Gāyatrī.
1.114.11	He who sings it, he presses the two givers of juice on the chest.
1.114.12	He who takes it away, he makes the Gāyatrīs a hole.
1.114.13	The sacrifice flows after the Gāyatri with a hole, the sacrificer after the sacrifice, the offspring after the sacrificer.
1.115.1	Having taken out all those syllables, one should offer speech.
1.115.2	Speech indeed is Brahman.
1.115.3	Just as one would cross over thorns by covering them with leather, in the same way, having broken the Yajna-post with speech and Brahman, one crosses over safely and does not suffer any harm.
1.115.4	The Reciter of the Gāyatrī verse is cut off from the Sāman if he does not recite the Pratihāra.
1.115.5	One should mentally recite the Pratihāras as they are being recited.
1.115.6	One should say, "The speech is different."
1.115.7	Thus the Sāman is not cut off and one does not suffer.
1.115.8	He who knows the syllable with rays, is carried by those connected with rays.
1.115.9	Speech is the syllable.
1.115.10	His breath is the ray.
1.115.11	Those who know this are united with the rays.
1.116.1	The verses are Marutvatī.
1.116.2	They take the Marutvat graha.
1.116.3	Indra, having the Maruts, slew Vṛtra for the sake of the killing of Vṛtra.
1.116.4	"The high-born one is for your enjoyment." They are Andhasvatī.
1.116.5	The day is Andhas.
1.116.6	The beginning is on the same day.
1.116.7	The sacrifice is indeed blind.
1.116.8	The beginning is of the sacrifice itself.
1.116.9	The ancient Brahmanas used to discuss thus: "There are three blindnesses in the sacrifice: Ucca te Jatam, Andhaso Vasor Mandanam, Andhaso Purojiti Vo Andhasah."
1.116.10	There are three enjoyments of animals: in the morning, at midday, and in the evening.
1.116.11	One obtains them by this.
1.116.12	These two worlds, the gods and the men, were together and then they separated.
1.116.13	Nothing fell to them in common.
1.116.14	The gods and the men ate for food.
1.116.15	The gods live by what is given from here, the men by what is given there.
1.116.16	That Prajapati saw these verses: "You have seen the high birth."
1.116.17	He brought the oblation to the gods with the word "ud."
1.116.18	"He caused rain to fall from heaven, from the earth, and from the sky."
1.116.19	He made these two worlds with their inhabitants.
1.116.20	They made these two worlds flow for him according to his desire.
1.116.21	These two worlds flow for one who knows this.
1.116.22	The Gayatri verse is explained in the Brahmana.
1.117.1	Now the Amhiyas.
1.117.2	Prajapati created beings.
1.117.3	They created the Anashanas.
1.117.4	They ate one another.
1.117.5	Prajapati thought, "How can these creatures of mine not be destroyed?"
1.117.6	He saw this Sama.
1.117.7	With it he gave them food, and with the withholding of rain.
1.117.8	He did not give them rain.
1.117.9	He saw this Nidhana.
1.117.10	He approached it.
1.117.11	Then he took it up.
1.117.12	For this indeed is the hymn and the rite of the rain-god, and the rain-god takes up and gives down.
1.117.13	He who desires rain should chant with this very Apanihita hymn.
1.117.14	The rain-god becomes favourable to him.
1.117.15	If it rains too much, he should approach this very Apanihata hymn.
1.117.16	He takes it up for him when it rains.
1.117.17	And when the rain falls for him, he takes it up. He who knows thus.
1.117.18	When his subjects, being well-disposed, approach him, they approach him as the Amāhiyāva.
1.117.19	His wives, being well- disposed, approach him as the well-disposed. He who knows this.
1.117.20	They approached him with food, not with food that was cooked.
1.117.21	as if he were the very god of wealth.
1.117.22	For food is wealth.
1.117.23	He lamented.
1.117.24	He became famous.
1.117.25	He thought, "How can I create these beings so that they do not neglect me when created?"
1.117.26	He saw this Sama Veda.
1.117.27	He praised with it.
1.118.1	The final verse was "I praise."
1.118.2	They were pleased.
1.118.3	They came under his control.
1.118.4-7	He delights his enemies and his brothers, and his own people come under his sway, for he who knows this. When he saw that they were being made small, that was the reason for the name of the Amāhiyāva. And when he made them small after having brought them under his sway, that was the name of the Āmāhiyāva. He who knows this makes his own people small after having brought him under his sway.
1.118.8	Those who are under his control, he should sit in their midst and recite.
1.118.9	He makes them obedient.
1.118.10	The people of the north-east (Uttarakuravas) say that the Soma is consumed by the Kurus and Pancalas without the Vashat-utterance.
1.118.11	The Hotri utters Vashat for each deity, and the Udgata for all.
1.118.12	The Udgata is for all deities.
1.118.13	If one were to offer the Soma at the end of the offering, one should offer the Vasat-call.
1.118.14	They consume the Soma after the Vasat-offering.
1.118.15	Marja Shailna said, "One pleases one's enemies by offering at the end."
1.118.16	One should offer the Vashat-call before the end of the Soma, saying, "Vashat! Give to the earth!"
1.118.17	One consumes the Soma after the Vaṣat-offering.
1.119.1	He who knows the source of the sacrifice, milks the sacrifice.
1.119.2	Indeed, Pavamāna is the sacrifice.
1.119.3	Of that, indeed, Gāyatrī is the source.
1.119.4	One should make the Gāyatrī with four verses.
1.119.5	He thus places the source of the very sacrifice. He milks the sacrifice
1.119.6	He who knows the foundation of the sacrifice, establishes the sacrifice, and stands firm with himself.
1.119.7	Indeed, pavamāna is the very sacrifice.
1.119.8	His support is indeed the Gāyatrī.
1.119.9	One should make the Gāyatrīs of four verses.
1.119.10	He thus establishes the support of the sacrifice.
1.119.11	He establishes himself in the sacrifice, and stands with himself.
1.119.12	The high-born one has come to you through the light of this, following the ancient one. One should make the Gâyatrîs in these (verses).
1.119.13	In these (verses) is the Amâhi-yava.
1.119.14	When he places the fourth (verse) in the Hayin (Stoma), then it becomes four-versed.
1.119.15	With the verses 'Pratitiṣṭhati' he establishes the sacrifice, and stands firm with himself.
1.120.1	Three metres indeed carry the sacrifice, the Gayatri, the Tristubh and the Jagati.
1.120.2	This Anushtubh follows after them.
1.120.3	By that the gods attained the heavenly world.
1.120.4	It did not suffice.
1.120.5	And in that (verse) they placed the four-footed animals, the cow, the horse, the sheep and the goat.
1.120.6	It sufficed.
1.120.7	They said, 'Having gone to the heavenly world, this became the Brihatī (verse), by which we have sufficed.'
1.120.8	That is why the Brihatī is called Brihatī.
1.120.9	Before that there was no metre called Brihatī.
1.120.10	Now this (verse) is indeed the cattle, namely the Brihatī.
1.120.11	He recites the Prastara with the Nidhana with which he takes up.
1.120.12	He again takes up the beginning with that (verse).
1.120.13	Therefore cattle are born from where they are born and come into existence.
1.120.14	They are born again from there.
1.120.15	One should not offer the Vasat-call with the Brihatī verse for the non-prosperity of cattle.
1.120.16	If one were to make the Vasat-call with the Brihatī, one would destroy the animals with the thunderbolt of the Vasat-calls.
1.121.1	The gods, having killed the Asuras, thought that they were impure and unclean.
1.121.2	They desired: "May we be pure, clean, and cooked. May we go to the heavenly world."
1.121.3	They saw these verses.
1.121.4	With them they purified themselves.
1.121.5	Purifying with the stream of Soma, wearing the waters, you flow.
1.121.6	The waters are the purifier.
1.121.7	They purify with water.
1.121.8	You sit in the womb of the giver of treasures, in truth.
1.121.9	The sky is truth.
1.121.10	They go beyond the sky with this.
1.121.11	The shining god of gold.
1.121.12	This world is the shining god.
1.121.13	They approached this very world with this.
1.121.14	Then indeed they became pure, worthy, and cooked, and went to the heavenly world.
1.121.15	One becomes pure, worthy, cooked, and goes to the heavenly world by reciting these verses.
1.122.1	Among them is the Raurava (verse).
1.122.2	Agni saw this Sama (verse) as Ruru.
1.122.3	Whatever Agni Ruru saw, that is the reason for the name Raurava.
1.122.4	Ruru, the old one, desiring cattle, practised austerities.
1.122.5	He saw this Sama.
1.122.6	He praised with it.
1.122.7	He approached this Ida.
1.122.8	Ida is cattle.
1.122.9	Then he obtained cattle.
1.122.10	This is the cattle-winning Sama.
1.122.11	He who knows this becomes one who has many cattle.
1.122.12	Because Ruru saw it when he was old, therefore it is called Raurava.
1.122.13	Now the Yaudhajayya.
1.122.14	Indra, when he was Yudhājiva, saw this Sama.
1.122.15	Because Indra, when he was Yudhajiva, saw it, that is why it is called Yaudhajayyam.
1.122.16	He who knows this conquers his enemies as if with a weapon.
1.122.17	Yudhajit Vaishvamitra, desiring stability, practised austerities.
1.122.18	He saw this Sama.
1.122.19	He praised with it.
1.122.20	Then he indeed became stable.
1.122.21	This is the Sama of stability.
1.122.22	He who knows this becomes stable.
1.122.23	Because Yudhājiva Vaishvamitra saw it, therefore it is called Yaudhajaya.
1.123.1	The gods, having divided the Asuras by means of Yaudhajaya, took away their own by means of Raurava, while they were crying.
1.123.2	He who knows this, having divided his enemy, his foe, by means of Yaudhajaya, takes away his own by means of Raurava, while he is crying.
1.123.3	The gods, ascending to heaven, went up with the Raurava.
1.123.4	The Asuras followed them, saying, "O! O!"
1.123.5	The gods became aware of this.
1.123.6	They saw this Stobha.
1.123.7	With it they struck the Asuras, saying, "Oh! Oh!"
1.123.8	The god Utsa made them touch the ground, saying, "Hira! Hi! Hi!"
1.123.9	The Urus, as it were, entered into it, and became the world of heaven.
1.123.10	The Udgātṛ should hold his voice high up to the end of the Prastara.
1.123.11	For the attainment of the world of heaven
1.123.12	The Nidānas and the Hotr should sing in a continuous tone, and thus attain the world of heaven,
1.123.13	For these are the extent of the Sama, this is the extent of the Sāman-comprehension, this is the limit of the Sāma-relation.
1.123.14	The Svaram is to be sung.
1.123.15	Breath is the Svaram.
1.123.16	Now the Nidhanam.
1.123.17	The Self is the Nidhanam
1.123.18	Now the Ida.
1.123.19	Cattle are the Ida.
1.123.20	He thus unites the Self, the breath, and the cattle.
1.123.21	He who knows this is praised by all the Sama, by all the Sama-related.
1.124.1	There are indeed two Sāman-s: the Stobha and the Astobha.
1.124.2	What was praised among them is the Kshatra.
1.124.3	And what was not praised is the Brahma.
1.124.4	He who knows this obtains both the Brahma and the Kshatra together.
1.124.5	And the Yaudhajayani, the Tri-nidhana, for the completion of the Savanas.
1.124.6	By means of the Pavamana, indeed, food is given to the gods.
1.124.7	It becomes the Madhyani-nidhana for the special purpose of food.
1.124.8	Whatever food is given to the gods, that would not be left here for men and cattle to live on.
1.124.9	Whatever is in the middle is for the distinction of food.
1.124.10	The gods wanted to take away the sacrificial fee from the Asuras. When this much of Dakshina is given, they do not praise or chant.
1.124.11	The gods perceived that.
1.124.12	They saw this Sama.
1.124.13	They praised with it.
1.124.14	They took the morning pressing with the first, the midday pressing with the second, and the third pressing with the third.
1.124.15	They took up those very thunderbolts.
1.124.16	The Asuras did not withstand those very thunderbolts that were raised.
1.124.17	Then indeed the gods became victorious, the Asuras defeated.
1.124.18	He who knows this becomes victorious over his own self, his enemy becomes defeated.
1.124.19	And indeed that Pavamāna is indeed incomplete in which there is no Triṇidhā.
1.124.20	And because there is Triṇidhā, for the completion of the Savanas.
1.125.1	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a battle, but they did not win the heaven.
1.125.2	Brihaspati was the priest of the gods, and Usanas Kavya was the priest of Asuras.
1.125.3	What was done before Brahma was done after it.
1.125.4	That is the same Brahma, which did not conquer.
1.125.5	Among them, the Gandharva Trishirsha knew about victory.
1.125.6	He was jealous.
1.125.7	He was floating in the water, in the middle of the city.
1.125.8	Indra knew this, saying, "We shall conquer with the three-headed one."
1.125.9	He sought his wife for the sake of this very victory.
1.125.10	She said to him, "Ask your husband who will conquer among these gods and demons who are engaged in a great battle."
1.125.11	He came to her, speaking thus.
1.125.12	He then became a water-snake or a grass-snake in the very same boat.
1.125.13	His wife asked him, "Who will win between the gods and the demons who are fighting?"
1.126.1	He replied, "The one who is higher." She said, "The earth is higher."
1.126.2	Even today they say, "The one that is higher, the earth is higher."
1.126.3	He said, "No." He said, "Tell me."
1.126.4	He said, "These two Brahmanas know equally. Brihaspati among the gods and Usanas Kavy among the Asuras."
1.126.5	Whatever they do, it is equal.
1.126.6	The other one offers the other oblations.
1.126.7	They meet and then go away as they came.
1.126.8	The one who will befriend the other will win."
1.126.9	Then Indra, having understood this, flew up as a hawk.
1.126.10	Seeing him falling, he said, "Those for whom he falls with a green color will win."
1.126.11	He approached Ashana Shakyamuni among the Asuras.
1.126.12	He said to him, "O sage, whom do you nourish? You are ours or we are yours. Come to us."
1.126.13	"How?" he asked. "With what mantra do you approach me?"
1.126.14	"With those who are the wish-yielding cows of Virocana Prahlāda."
1.126.15	They ran away from him, saying, "With them!"
1.126.16	The Asuras followed them.
1.126.17	They followed them.
1.126.18	He said, "O sage, these Asuras have followed us."
1.126.19	He said, "Do it in such a way that they do not follow us again."
1.126.20	They did this.
1.127.1	The God Indra, with his weapon, blows, the chastiser of foes, protecting the people, the father of the gods, the generator, the well-skilled, the supporter of heaven, the firm one of earth.
1.127.2	He indeed supports the heaven.
1.127.3	The Asuras did not cross him.
1.127.4	He indeed approached the gods with the cows that yield what is desired.
1.127.5	Those two, having come, made a great effort. The sage, the Brahman, the leader of the people, the wise one, the wise one Usanas, he indeed knew what was hidden among them, the imperishable secret, the name of the cattle.
1.127.6	These are the verses about cattle.
1.127.7	One who recites these verses obtains cattle and becomes one with many cattle.
1.127.8	In them is the verse of Usanas.
1.127.9-14	Uśanas Kāvya desired the immortal Gandharva world among the gods. He saw this Sama. He praised with it. Then he obtained the immortal Gandharvaloka among the gods. This is the Sama that knows the worlds. One who praises with this obtains the immortal Gandharvī world among the gods.
1.127.15	What Uśanā Kāvya saw, from that it is called Uśanasa.
1.127.16	It becomes Svara.
1.127.17	By means of Svara, the food is given to the gods at the end.
1.127.18	The Pavamāna ends with the Rk.
1.127.19	They do not exceed the Sāman with the Rk, they do not exceed the Rk with the Sāman.
1.127.20	Now, when one praises here and there in the Pavamāna (hymn), it is for the sake of equality and equal attainment.
1.127.21	The Gāyatrī has the resonance of the feet in front and the resonance of the foot above at the end of the Pavamāna.
1.127.22	Therefore, the beings are Prāṇas on both sides, both upward and downward.
1.127.23	The Gâyatrî is in the Dvîsânî.
1.127.24	This is the same as the downward-moving breath.
1.127.25	Therefore, with this breath he makes two things: ash and wind.
1.127.26	The Brihatī is in the two directions.
1.127.27	This is the same as that which moves forward.
1.127.28	Therefore, he makes two things with this breath: he sprinkles semen and urinates.
1.127.29	The Ekasaṃni is in the Tristubh.
1.127.30	The navel itself is that.
1.127.31	In that (Sāman) there is one (Sāman).
1.127.32	Therefore he makes it with one breath only, as he breathes in and out the breaths.
1.128.1	When Prajapati created the Brihat and Rathantara, he first saw the mind as the Brihat.
1.128.2	He uttered the Rathantara as speech.
1.128.3	Now, because he uttered the Rathantara in the voice, therefore the Rathantara came first to be yoked.
1.128.4	And because he saw the Brihat in the mind first, therefore they are called Brihat and Rathantara.
1.128.5	The mind is indeed the former, and the voice the latter.
1.128.6	The mind indeed is the Brihat, and the voice is the Rathantara.
1.128.7	Rathantara is indeed a verse, and Brihat a chant.
1.128.8-14	The Rathantara is Brahman, the Brihat is Kshatra. This is the Rathantara, that is the Brihat. That which is moving is the Rathantara. That which has come to a stand is the Brihat Those animals which have teeth on one side only are the Rathantara. Those which have teeth on both sides are the Brihat. That which is the oblique lightning is the Rathantara.
1.128.15	The one that is above is the Barhaspatya.
1.128.16	One should sing with the Rathantara after having collected the greatness of the Rathantara, "Whatever is your greatness in the fire, whatever is your greatness in water, in the chariot, whatever is your great-ness in the thunder, whatever is your greatest in the wind, by that greatness, O Rathantara, do thou become endowed with wealth."
1.128.17	The Udgātṛ becomes possessed of wealth, the sacrificer becomes possessed of wealth; the offspring becomes possessed of wealth.
1.129.1	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
1.129.2	The gods created the thunderbolt with a razor edge, indeed a man.
1.129.3	He conquered the Asuras.
1.129.4	He turned back the Asuras and returned to the gods.
1.129.5	The gods were afraid of him.
1.129.6	Having struck him, he hurled the thunderbolt at the two, Brihadratha and Ratha.
1.129.7	This thunderbolt, having the edge of a razor, was hurled at the two, and it was indeed a man.
1.129.8	One should place him in the mouth of the one whom one hates.
1.129.9	If the Soma is to be offered to Rathantara, when Rathantara is being chanted, one should say, "Salutations to the mother earth, O Rathantara, do not harm me."
1.129.10	If the Soma is to offered to Brihat, when Brihat is being chanted, he should say, "I seek refuge in the father heaven, O Brihat, do not harm."
1.129.11	Then he should address him thus: "With your breaths, you should win the breaths of so-and-so. With your sharpness, you should win his sharpness. With your life, you should win this one's life. You should strike him with anger and the rod. You should pierce him with the bowstring."
1.129.12	He puts him in the mouth of the Brihat and Rathantara.
1.129.13	The one whom he hates, his life departs before a year.
1.130.2	This is indeed the divine chariot.
1.130.3	He who knows this becomes a charioteer.
1.130.4	If the Soma is Rāthantara, the Brihat should not be interrupted.
1.130.5	If the soma is Brihat, the Rathantara should not be interrupted
1.130.6	The Ho is indeed the Brihat.
1.130.7	The Rathantara is the Ho.
1.130.8	When the Rathantara is being chanted, one should take up the beginning after saying "Ho."
1.130.9	He thus yokes the Brihat to the mouth of the Rathantara.
1.130.10	Having said, "The Brihat is being presented," one should take up the beginning.
1.130.11	He yokes the Rathantara to the mouth of the Brihat.
1.130.12	He makes the chariot of the gods firm, establishes it in the sacrifice, and stands firm with himself.
1.130.13	This indeed is the chariot of the divine gods, namely the Rathantara.
1.130.14	When the Rathantara is being presented, one should go to the earth with one's hands for the non-destruction of the chariot of the divinities.
1.131.1-9	One syllable is stopped. Therefore the chariot of the gods goes forward with each axle. Two syllables are stopped. Two are the sides of the chariot. It is by means of the sides that it establishes the chariot of the god. Three syllables are stopped. The sacrificer has two feet. The self is the third. It is indeed the sacrificer who stands firm.
1.131.10	Then indeed these three worlds.
1.131.11	He attains them.
1.131.12	He recites four syllables.
1.131.13	There are four directions.
1.131.14	Animals have four feet.
1.131.15	It stands in the directions and in the animals.
1.131.16	He recitates five syllables.
1.131.17	The sacrifice is fivefold.
1.131.18	Animals are fivefold.
1.131.19	And in the sacrifice and in the animals it is established.
1.131.20	It stops at six syllables.
1.131.21	There are six seasons.
1.131.22	It is established in the seasons.
1.131.23	And there are six metres.
1.131.24	It obtains them.
1.131.25	It stops with seven syllables.
1.131.26	The Sakvaris have seven feet.
1.131.27	The animals are Sakvaris.
1.131.28	It is indeed in the animals that the Śakvarī (chant) is established.
1.131.29	And the seven (syllables) are the seven plus four metres.
1.131.30	The seven are the principal vital airs.
1.131.31	One indeed obtains them.
1.131.32	He recites eight syllables.
1.131.33	The Gāyatrī has eight syllables.
1.131.34	Gāyatrī is splendour and Brahmanic lustre.
1.131.35	It is indeed in splendour and Brahmanic luster that it is established.
1.131.36	Then, indeed, in the eight-spoked animals.
1.132.1	He stops with nine syllables.
1.132.2	There are nine breaths in a man.
1.132.3	He thus seizes the breaths of his hated enemy and puts the breaths into himself.
1.132.4	And he attains the praise of the Stoma in the Trivrt (stoma).
1.132.5	He stops with ten syllables.
1.132.6	The Viraj has ten syllables.
1.132.7-15	Food is Viraj. It indeed stands in food through Viraj. And ten are the vital airs. He indeed obtains them. He recites eleven syllables. Eleven syllables are the Tristubh. The Tristubh is power and strength. He indeed stands in power and strength. He recites twelve syllables.
1.132.16	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
1.132.17	The Jagati is the cattle.
1.132.18	It stands firm in the cattle, in the Jagati.
1.132.19	And there are twelve months.
1.132.20	He obtains them.
1.132.21	It has thirteen syllables.
1.132.22	It is that thirteenth month which is beyond. He obtains it.
1.132.23	It has fourteen syllables.
1.132.24-30	The year is fourteen-fold. He indeed stands firm in the year. He recites fifteen syllables. Fifteen are the nights of half a month. He indeed attains the year by half a month. He recites sixteen syllables. The man has sixteen parts.
1.132.31	The art itself carries away the evil, the enemy, the one who is below.
1.132.32	One attains prosperity for oneself.
1.132.33	And one attains the praise of the sixteen-fold Stoma.
1.132.34	One recites the Stobha with seventeen syllables.
1.132.35	Prajapati is seventeen.
1.132.36	One indeed stands firm in Prajapati.
1.133.1	One should recite this other Stobha:
1.133.2	He should sing only the verse.
1.133.3	When he sings only the verse, he does not go beyond the form of Rathantara.
1.133.4	The Rathantara is a verse, the Brihat is a Sama.
1.133.5	If he were to stop, he should stop at eight syllables.
1.133.6	That is two for the calf.
1.133.7	He should look at the sky and look back for the eyes not to be obstructed.
1.133.8	If one were to offer the Isana verse to Indra, then the Isana would be hostile to the sacrificer's cattle.
1.133.9	But when one offers the Snan verse to Indra, the Snan does not become hostile to the sacrificers' cattle. The offspring flourish in peace.
1.133.10	One should say to the Udgata at the offering of the Iḍa:
1.133.11	The Iḍa is cattle, the Rathantara is the abode.
1.133.12	He establishes these animals in the very place.
1.133.13	One should say, 'to the standing ones.'
1.133.14	If one were to say, 'to those standing,' his prosperity would stand still.
1.133.15	But if one says, 'to the non-standing ones,' his prosperity does not stand still, many go with his own wealth.
1.133.16	One should recite the Brihat and Rathantara verses.
1.133.17	If one were to not alternate between the Brihat and the Rathantara, then just as the branches of two large trees would fall down together, so would the offspring and cattle fall down.
1.133.18	The Brihat and the Rathanara are indeed the same.
1.133.19	One alternates between the Brihat (chant) and the Rathantara (chant).
1.133.20	One who knows this is freed from sin.
1.134.1	One should approach with the desire to be like this.
1.134.2	So that it may be like this, one who has an enemy.
1.134.3	One who knows this becomes an enemy of his own self.
1.134.4	When Bṛhat and Rathantara were created, the beings and cattle trembled out of fear from them.
1.134.5	They looked at themselves and said, "What is this cruel thing that has happened to us, from which we are afraid and have fled with our offspring and cattle?"
1.134.6	They saw it only in the dead.
1.134.7	They left the village and went to the forest.
1.134.8	That very place became a desert.
1.134.9	Therefore they say, "One should not accept the self-created hell, for the Lord is the worst sinner, if one accepts the self-created hells."
1.134.10	Indeed, these two, Brihat and Rathantara, are burnt by their own ends.
1.134.11	Indeed, these are sung in the village, and the ends are removed, namely, the Brihat and Rathantara.
1.134.12	One may indeed praise with these two verses in a village.
1.135.1	He praises with an eight-syllable verse.
1.135.2	He praises the next with a two-syllable verse, for the sake of advancement and non-decline.
1.135.3	He praises (the next) with an eight-syllablle verse.
1.135.4	He then praises the next with two-syllable verses.
1.135.5	He thus places the two-footed (man) among the animals with eight kinds of hoofs.
1.135.6	Therefore he establishes the animals with two feet and eight legs.
1.135.7	He recites with an eight-syllabled (verse).
1.135.8	He recites the next two with a two-syllabled verse.
1.135.9	That makes twelve.
1.135.10	Twelve months are a year.
1.135.11	The year is Prajapati, the sacrifice.
1.135.12	By this he attains the year, Prajapati, and the sacrifice.
1.135.13	In the imperishable ones he performs the Rathantara.
1.135.14	Therefore the chariot, having gone and returned, comes back.
1.135.15	The gods, having separated the Asuras with the Rathantara, overwhelmed them with the Brihat.
1.135.16	He who knows this, having separated his enemy, his foe, with the Rathantara overwhelms him with the Brihat.
1.135.17	The gods went upward to the heavenly world by means of the Rathantara.
1.135.18	The Asuras and Rakshasas, in nine and nine groups, surrounded these worlds.
1.135.19	The chariots were called Rathas.
1.135.20	The gods, having praised by means of the same Rathantara, ascended the Rathantara and went to the heavenly world.
1.135.21	They said, "We have crossed these chariots."
1.135.22	That is the reason why it is called Rathantara.
1.135.23	He who knows this conquers his enemies.
1.136.1	The Rathas (chariots) are indeed food. The Rathantara is food.
1.136.2	They conquer the enemies by food.
1.136.3	Having conquered the enemies by food, they ascend to heaven.
1.136.4	The gods desired heaven by means of the Brihat.
1.136.5	They did not attain it.
1.136.6	In that (place) they placed the Uṣṇīka and Kakubha (bricks).
1.136.7	By that (place) he pervades.
1.136.8	They said, "Having gone to the heavenly world, it was indeed great, by which we have pervaded the heavenly world."
1.136.9	That itself is the greatness of the Brihat.
1.136.10	One desiring heaven should ascend twelve Brihat stages.
1.136.11	One desiring rain should strike the ocean.
1.136.12	As many syllables as there are in the Brihatī and the Uṣṇīṣa and Kakubha, so far is this world from heaven.
1.136.13	He who knows this attains heaven.
1.137.1	Here is the Brihatī.
1.137.2	The mind is the Brihat.
1.137.3	The invocation has twelve syllables.
1.137.4	For that much is the Sama.
1.137.5	Twelve months are a year.
1.137.6	The year is the Sama.
1.137.7	The three great supports are these worlds.
1.137.8	They again become nine, the vital airs.
1.137.9	The mind is the tenth.
1.137.10	The twelve great bodies are the months.
1.137.11	The months are the rays.
1.137.12	The rays are the Maruts.
1.137.13	By them this sun is held.
1.137.14	He who knows this, wherever he wishes to be held, he is held there.
1.137.15	He who knows the Bṛhat's Bṛhat-place, prospers in offspring and cattle.
1.137.16	The Bṛhat' s Bṛhat- place is indeed twelve syllables.
1.137.17	It is as if it were stretched out to be sung.
1.137.18	He who knows the Bृhat's Trivṛt-place, goes to the extent of the Ksatriya-place.
1.137.19	The Bृhat' s Trivṛt places are indeed the Roha-places.
1.137.20	The light of this true Brahman shines forth for him who knows thus.
1.137.21	Indra, having struck Vritra with his thunderbolt, thinking that he had not been wounded, went to the farthest end.
1.137.22	Prajapati desired him, saying, "Let there be from that."
1.137.23	He called him with "O Ho!"
1.137.24	He became.
1.137.25	One who is bound should say "O Ho!"
1.137.26	He indeed goes to the world of heaven.
1.138.1	The gods, when they were about to attack the Asuras, said: "Let us put aside whatever wealth we have and fight. Let us attack whatever being there is today."
1.138.2	Cattle indeed were their wealth.
1.138.3	Having put it aside, they attacked.
1.138.4	The gods conquered the Asuras.
1.138.5	They, having conquered, again came back and united with one being.
1.138.6	They did not know, 'This is mine, this is mine.'
1.138.7	They said, 'Let us divide this.'
1.138.8	They did not succeed in dividing it equally.
1.138.9	They said, let us ask Prajapati.'
1.138.10	They asked Prajapati.
1.138.11	Prajapati said, "This is the common property of all. They will praise all with this. They will obtain all with this. Do not divide it."
1.138.12	When they praise in the Gāyatrī verses, it is for Agni.
1.138.13	For Agni is Gāyatrī.
1.138.14	When they praise the Madhyandina Sāman, it is for Indra.
1.138.15	Whatever they praise in the Kavati verses, that is Prajapati.
1.138.16	Whatever is not mentioned, that is Vaishvadeva.
1.138.17	Whatever they praise for the Maitravaruna, that is Maitravaruna.
1.138.18	That indeed is the cattle, namely Vamadevya.
1.138.19	One should sing without moving, for the non-loss of cattle.
1.138.20	If one sings moving, one would lose cattle.
1.138.21	They say, "He should sing with his head covered and motionless, lest the observers should censure him."
1.138.22	This is the form of the rite.
1.138.23	One should sing with his own head covered and motionless.
1.139.1	In ancient times, they used to place the head of a dead man on the ground.
1.139.2	"He who will not let it fall while singing, he will not sing."
1.139.3	That is indeed the form of what is to be done.
1.139.4	One may indeed sing it.
1.139.5	He sings with three hidden syllables.
1.139.6	There are indeed these three worlds.
1.139.7	Prajapati is Vamadevya.
1.139.8	Prajapata is the leader of the worlds.
1.139.9	He who is the leader of worlds, may he lead us to the worlds.
1.139.10	One should obtain the bull of the praise of Vamadevya.
1.139.11	This is the bull.
1.139.12	The womb is the Vamadevya.
1.139.13	The bull is the procreation.
1.139.14	He thus puts procreation into procreation in the womb for the sake of propagation.
1.139.15	It is sung as if indirectly.
1.139.16	One should not touch the string.
1.139.17	The Vamadevya is the youth.
1.139.18	If one touches the grass, it is as if one were to fall from the sky onto a tree. It is like that.
1.139.19	One should not cross over in between the steps.
1.139.20	If one crosses over in between the two steps, it is as though one were to fall down. It is like this.
1.139.21	One should cross over starting from the northern step.
1.139.22	As one crosses over in accordance with the sequence of steps, it is like that.
1.140.1	The Pratihara is as it were a break in the Sama.
1.140.2	One should pass over it without heeding the Pratihara.
1.140.3	That is indeed a difficult form, if the Sama should be lost.
1.140.4	The Udgata should say, "Speech is being obstructed in the Pratihara."
1.140.5	Speech is indeed Brahman.
1.140.6	He thus unites it with Brahman.
1.140.7	The waters were the wives of the gods.
1.140.8	They desired a union.
1.140.9	They approached Mitra and Varuna.
1.140.10	They placed a foetus.
1.140.11	From that the cattle were born.
1.140.12	One should perform (the rite) for one desiring cattle in the Revati (constellation).
1.140.13	One becomes one who has cattle.
1.140.14	One who is masterless becomes one who has offspring.
1.140.15	It comes from the wives of the poets, from the daughters of Prajapati.
1.140.16	Now indeed, Bharadvaja Prisni saw the praise of the cow-desiring one: "By what wonderful thing did it come to us? The auspicious ones are in the same place. Come to us, O friend of friends."
1.140.17	When he places one auspicious one in the middle, then he does not go to the cattle.
1.140.18-23	Because the two verses of Prajapati are at the beginning and end, therefore it goes to the offspring. It becomes the Svara. The Svara is indeed the breath. He thus places the breath in the animals. The sacrificer's animals are indeed deprived of the Svara. If one were to perform the Nidhana, one would deprive the breath.
1.141.1	The one who is not afraid of the tormentors, the one who is not old, the one who has a hundred years, the one who does not harm, the one who harms me, the one who will harm me, the one at the end, the one in the northern half, one should do.
1.141.2	It is like that, as if one were to strike cows with a stick after having tied them up in a pen.
1.141.3	They say that it should be done in one's own place.
1.141.4	If one were to examine the one who has done this, he should say, "The sacrificer's cattle have been driven away by the sound." He should say, "Rathantara is at the end, Nadhasha is above. My cattle are enclosed on both sides by them. This is the breath in the middle of the cattle."
1.141.5	He who thus acts and reflects upon it, he meets with calamity.
1.141.6	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
1.141.7	There are eight Vasus.
1.141.8	The morning pressing is in the Gayatri metre.
1.141.9	The deities are connected with the syllable and the syllable.
1.141.10	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
1.141.11	There ate eleven Rudras.
1.141.12	The midday pressing is in the Tristubh metre.
1.141.13	The deity is connected with the syllable.
1.141.14	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
1.141.15	The twelve Adityas.
1.141.16	The third pressing is Jagat.
1.141.17	The deity is connected with the syllable Aksara.
1.141.18	Now, does it lead the sacrificer to each sacrifice?
1.141.19	He should say, "When Prajapati created Vamadevya, three syllables emerged from it. That itself became the three-syllabled Purusha. One should say 'Purusha' in the praise of Vamadevya. It takes the sacrificer to the other sacrifice."
1.141.20	They say, "One should not say 'Purusha'. One should meditate on it indirectly and restrain it mentally."
1.141.21	They say, one should not meditate on the unseen, nor should one restrain the mind. Whatever one knows, that alone is attained.
1.142.1	The gods, approaching the Asuras for battle, said, "Let us put aside whatever wealth we have and fight. If today we are obstructed by any being,"
1.142.2	The breath was their wealth.
1.142.3	Having put aside the fight, he went to the other side.
1.142.4	Having become one, it stood creating the Ṛks, Sāmans, Yajus, cows, horses, goats, sheep, grains, barley, Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. Whatever there is, all that.
1.142.5	They say to them, "That is yours, that is ours. It stands creating having become one."
1.142.6	The gods conquered the Asuras.
1.142.7	Having conquered, they returned again and united with one being.
1.142.8	They did not know which was theirs.
1.142.9	They said, "Let us divide this."
1.142.10	They did not succeed in dividing it.
1.142.11	He said to them all, "All of you will be praised by me. I will know all of you. Do not divide yourselves."
1.142.12	When they praise in the Gāyatrī verses, it is for Agni.
1.142.13	Because Agni is Gāyatrī.
1.142.14	When they praise the Madhyandina Sāman, it is for Indra.
1.142.15	When they sing in the Kavati verses, it is the Prajapati Sāman.
1.142.16	What is not mentioned, that is for the Vaiśvadeva (offering).
1.142.17	What they praise for the Maitrāvaruṇa (priest), that is for the Maitrāvaruna.
1.142.18	He said to them, "Create from me."
1.142.19	They said, "Yes."
1.142.20	They sang it.
1.142.21	They said, 'Create.'
1.143.1	He created the Rathantara.
1.143.2	The sound of the chariot followed it.
1.143.3	They said, "With the hymn of the one who has no enemies."
1.143.4	Therefore, at the Rathantara hymn, they make the sound of a chariot.
1.143.5	One should know that it is indeed with the hymn of the non-enemy.
1.143.6	They said, "Let it be created."
1.143.7	It created the Brihat.
1.143.8	The sound of Parjanya was created.
1.143.9	They said, "With the hymn of the one who has no enemies."
1.143.10	Therefore, at the Brihat hymn, they beat drums.
1.143.11	The rain god becomes rainy.
1.143.12	One should know that it is with the hymn of the on who has no enemies.
1.143.13	They said, "Let us create!"
1.143.14	He created the Vaikara.
1.143.15	The village-cry was produced from that.
1.143.16	They said, "By the hymn of Aramsa."
1.143.17	Therefore they perform the village-cry at the Vaivāhika hymn.
1.143.18	One should know that it is indeed by the hymn of Araṃsa.
1.143.19	They said to him, "Do you create."
1.143.20	He created the Vaivāhaka.
1.143.21	That is the sound of Agni.
1.143.22	They said, "With the Stotra of Aradsman."
1.143.23	Therefore they churn Agni at the Stotra of Vaimata.
1.143.24	One should know that it is indeed with the Stotra of Aradaman.
1.143.25	They said to him, "Do create!"
1.143.26	He created Shakra.
1.143.27	The sound of the waters was produced from that.
1.143.28	They said, "With the praise of the one who is without decay."
1.143.29	Therefore, they praise after placing the water in the praise of the Shakra.
1.143.30	One should know that it is indeed with the praise of the praise of the non-decaying one.
1.143.31	They said to him, "Do create!"
1.143.32	He created the Raivata.
1.143.33	Then the sound of animals was produced.
1.143.34	They said, "With the praise of Aratsman."
1.143.35	Therefore, at the praise of Raivata, they make the sound of animals and unite the calves with their mothers.
1.143.36	One should know that it is indeed with the praise of Araatsman.
1.143.37	They said to him, "Do produce (it)."
1.144.1	He did not create that.
1.144.2	It rose up above him, like the back, like the tail.
1.144.3	The gods took it up and rose up with it.
1.144.4	They said, "This much is enough. This much is enough for us. This is the share of the gods."
1.144.5	What they said, "This much is known, this much is not known," that is the reason why it is called Vamadevya.
1.144.6	This is the father and mother of the Sama-Veda, namely, the Vamadevya hymn.
1.144.7	When a son transgresses, the father is his chastiser and the father is his punisher.
1.144.8	Therefore, when it is performed in the middle, it is for the sake of peace and prohibition.
1.144.9	Now those hymns which are sung at the end, of them the Vamadevya is the last.
1.144.10	And those which are not sung at the end are the first.
1.144.11	For the peace and prohibition of both of them.
1.144.12	It should be sung in a low voice, neither too high nor too low.
1.144.13	If one sings too high, one would go to the control of one's superior enemy.
1.144.14	If one sings in a low voice, one would be able to control the evil brother.
1.144.15	This is indeed his (i.e. the sacrificer's) own world, this is the atmosphere.
1.144.16	He who knows this, he is indeed being controlled by this (world).
1.144.17	They say, "It does not touch this world from a span's distance, nor does it touch the other world from a span’s distance."
1.144.18	Then they say, "It does not touch this world by as much as the membrane of a cow's calf, and by as much it does not touch the other world."
1.144.19	Then they say, "By as much as the embryo of excrement, it does not touch this or the other world." This is the view of those who think like this.
1.144.20	This is the view of the one who thinks like this.
1.144.21	They say that just as the two wheels are fixed to the axle, so these two worlds are fixed to this (earth).
1.144.22	It touches this world, it touches the other world.
1.144.23	One should not sing the path of another.
1.144.24	One who sings the path of another is under the control of another.
1.144.25	The path of one's own is to be sung.
1.144.26	He who knows the honey of the gods becomes honey-worthy.
1.144.27	The Vamadevya is indeed the honey of the Gods.
1.144.28	He who knows this becomes honey-worthy
1.145.1	These two worlds, existing together, separated.
1.145.2	Nothing fell equally between them.
1.145.3	The gods and men ate for sustenance.
1.145.4	The gods live by giving from here, and the men by giving from there.
1.145.5	They said to Brihadratha and Ratha-ntara, "We will marry you with those two dear bodies of ours."
1.145.6	Ratha-ntara was indeed the dear body of the Shyaitas, and Naudhasa was the dear body of Brihat.
1.145.7	They married them.
1.145.8	He paid the price for her from afar, smoke from here, for that one.
1.145.9	He himself paid the bride-price of her, namely a year, for the divine worship. This is the bride-price for her.
1.145.10	He who knows this, indeed, is the one who has the most wealth.
1.145.11	He who does not know this, indeed, has the least wealth.
1.145.12	Therefore they say, "One should not arrange him in a way that he is not."
1.145.13	He indeed ascends the marriage of Brihat and Rathantara.
1.145.14	He is the lord of the two who have been defeated.
1.145.15	They said to him, "We will have a dwelling together."
1.146.1	The dwelling of the two was at first in the Padani-dhana, and the dwelling of the two in the Vasuni-dhana.
1.146.2	They had a dwelling together.
1.146.3	Then indeed, those who are here now dwell in each other's houses.
1.146.4	As in one's own house, so in the house of a stranger.
1.146.5-14	They praise with the Rathantara. This is the Rathantara. Now with the Vamadevya. This is space, the Vamadevyal. Now with the Naudasa. This is Naudasa. He conquers the worlds above without interruption. They praise with the Brihat. This is Brihat. Now with the Vaamadevya.
1.146.15	This is the Vāmadevya of the sky.
1.146.16	Now the Shyaita.
1.146.17	This is the Shyaita. It is the same as the Vāma devya.
1.146.18	He conquers the worlds from the unseen to the seen.
1.146.19	He conqures both worlds, the upper and the lower, he who knows this.
1.147.1	Now the Naudasa.
1.147.2	Noa, the son of Kaakshivat, was wandering without a fixed abode. He desired, 'May I have a fixed abode.'
1.147.3	He saw the gods dividing the Brahman.
1.147.4	He said, 'I am a sage, the creator of mantras. I wandered without a fixed abode, and now I desire that you should give me that by which I may have a fixed abode.
1.147.5	They gave him the essence of the Brahman.
1.147.6	That very one became the Naudhasa.
1.147.7	With that he praised.
1.147.8	Then indeed he stood firm.
1.147.9	This is the Pratiṣṭhā Sāman.
1.147.10	He who knows this stands firm.
1.147.11	Indeed, this Naudhasa is the essence of the Brahmaṇ.
1.147.12	He whose praise is sung with the essence of the Brahmana, he who knows this, is praised with the Naudhasa.
1.147.13	It has two syllables and the number of breaths. For stability.
1.147.14	The sacrificer has two feet for stability.
1.147.15	Because the Noudhas saw the Kaksivatas, therefore it is called Noudhas.
1.148.1	One desiring cattle should perform this.
1.148.2	Prajapati created cattle.
1.148.3	They, created by him, fled.
1.148.4	He desired, "May my cattle not wander away, may they return to me."
1.148.5	He saw this Sama.
1.148.6	He praised with it.
1.148.7	It had the Nidhana "Vasus".
1.148.8	Cattle indeed are Vasus.
1.148.9	From that the cattle returned to him.
1.148.10	From that he became one from whom they did not wander away.
1.148.11	He said, "The animals have been made to be sheep."
1.148.12	That is the reason why it is called "Shyaita."
1.148.13	This is the "Pashavi" (animal-related) Sama.
1.148.14	Animals stand near him who has been made to be a sheep; animals turn towards him; animals do not go away from him who knows this.
1.148.15	It has two Arana-ni-dhanas for stability.
1.148.16	The sacrificer has two feet for stability.
1.149.1	One should perform the rite of the mind of Gautama when the mind has departed.
1.149.2	The mind departed from Gautama.
1.149.3	He desired, "May my mind not depart again, may it enter me again."
1.149.4	He saw these two Sāmans.
1.149.5	He praised with them.
1.149.6	Then his mind entered him again, "May my (mind) not depart from me."
1.149.7	The mind again enters him, the mind does not depart from him who knows thus.
1.149.8	"He drinks" is of the Rathantara Saman, "He drinks" is the Brihat Saman.
1.149.9	"What Gautama saw" is why Gautama's mind is called noble.
1.150.1	One desiring progeny should perform for Vasishtha's mother.
1.150.2-8	Vasishtha, having lost his son, desired to beget many sons and cattle. He saw these two Sāmans. He praised with them. Then he begot many sons and cattle These two are the Sāmans that beget. He who knows this begets many sons and cattle.
1.150.9	The Jānitrā is the name of the Brhat Sāman.
1.150.10	Vasīṣṭha saw it, hence it is called Vasīṣṭha's Jānitrā.
1.151.1	One who desires long life should perform the Paura mīḍha, the Dakṣoṇi Dhanam.
1.151.2	Tarant and Purumīḍha, the sons of Mahī Ārcana, were the sons of Mahāyai and Mahī.
1.151.3	Then a woman, having approached them, said, "For the sake of my son, she is suffering. Please treat her."
1.151.4	They spoke angrily, "How could you speak to us like this?"
1.151.5	"One should offer her to the Arvī."
1.151.6	That woman, having faith, said, "The divine sages told me to offer her to the Arbī."
1.151.7	When they returned, he said to them, "The one whom you said was the boy, he is lying down, having been brought up by Arvīṣa."
1.151.8	They made a halt as if they were on a journey.
1.151.9	They desired to go from here, saying, "We will find a protector. May this boy live."
1.151.10	Purumīḍha saw this Sama Veda.
1.151.11	Therefore, he praises.
1.151.12	O Agni, praise with hymns, the shining one, Agni, the wise, the knower, the one who is praised by many.
1.151.13	Who is the young one?
1.151.14	His name is Suditi.
1.151.15	Agni praised him for his good praise.
1.151.16	He turned to that end.
1.151.17	He united him with this means, with Daksha.
1.151.18	The Dakshas are the vital airs.
1.151.19	He placed the vital airs in him.
1.151.20	This is the Gatuvin and Nathvin Sama.
1.151.21	He found the Gatu and the Nath.
1.151.22	He who knows this finds the Gatu and Nath.
1.151.23	Because Purumilha saw it, therefore it is called the Purumilha, the Daksha-wealth.
1.152.1	One who is desirous of attacking an enemy or one who has an enemy should perform this for seven days.
1.152.2	Jamadagni was the priest of the Mahenasa tribe.
1.152.3	He defeated them in a contest of wealth.
1.152.4	They then conspired against him.
1.152.5	He thought, "How can I kill seven of their cattle in a single day?"
1.152.6	He saw this Sama.
1.152.7	He praised with it.
1.152.8	Then he killed seven of their cattle in one day.
1.152.9	They kill them in the same way.
1.152.10	That is indeed for the destruction of the enemy.
1.152.11	He who knows this destroys the enemy, the hater.
1.152.12	Whatever Jamadagni saw, from that it is called the seven-day (rite) of Jamadagni.
1.152.13	They (the sages) increased beyond the limit of what was sung (in the Vedas). They did not touch the heaven as if they were rising up. Having injured Bhrigu, they were defeated by the irresistible (power of the gods).
1.152.14	He who injures one who knows this (truth), he indeed is defeated by the irresistible.
1.153.1-9	The gods and the Asuras competed in the sacrifice. The gods drove the Asuras out with the Bahispavamāna (hymn). The Asuras approached the Agniya ghee. The gods approached the Maitravaruna (hymn). The Asuras approached the Indra (hymn). Then the gods approached the Indra-Agni (hymn). They approached the Madhyandina Pavamāna (hymn) The gods approached Rathantara (hymn). Those Asuras approached the Vamadevya (hymn).
1.153.10	Those gods were the Naudhasas.
1.153.11	Those Asuras were the Kalayins.
1.153.12	They were overcome by the Kalayins themselves.
1.153.13	They were made non-Kalayins by the Kalayin himself.
1.153.14	That they were made non-kalayins is the non-kalayin-ness of the Kalayins
1.153.15	He who knows this makes his enemy, his foe, non-kalayic.
1.153.16	They went to the directions.
1.153.17	They were overtaken by the Kalayina himself.
1.153.18	What he did not know in the past, that is the reason why he is called Kāleyas.
1.153.19	He who knows this, destroys his enemy who hates him.
1.153.20	The sacrifice is the tree, the Stoma is the fruit.
1.153.21	They destroyed them by means of the sacrifice and the Stoma.
1.153.22	He who thus knows, destroys his enemy by means of the Sacrifice and the Stoma.
1.154.1-5	The Asuras went by the Rc, the gods by the Sama. The gods, having restrained the Asuras by the Rc, pressed them down by the Sama. Thus one should press down the hated foe. "The gods, having gone to the great assembly, the drinkers of Soma, the strong, the strong, they have gone to the great, the strong." This is the Rathantara Sama. "The strong" is the Brihat Sama.
1.154.6	Both of them are indeed in this (Sāman).
1.154.7	Therefore one should sing both forms, the Rāthantara and the Bāhrata.
1.154.8	The Brāhmaṇasāman is different for both of them.
1.154.9	But both of them are in this (Sâman).
1.154.10	Therefore, one should sing both the forms.
1.154.11	It becomes the Iḍa.
1.154.12	Cattle are the Iḍa;
1.154.13	They placed them with cattle.
1.154.14	Therefore, the one who has cattle and the one who does not have cattle, when they compete, the one who does have cattle, he alone prevails over them.
1.154.15	This indeed is the Sama Veda, which follows these creatures.
1.154.16	They offer this continuous Iḍa to it at the end, so that the creatures may not be driven away from their abodes.
1.154.17	Therefore, the creatures are not driven away from their abode.
1.154.18	The gods, the ancestors, and men were on one side, the Asuras, the Rakshas, and the Pisachas on the other.
1.154.19	They competed with each other in these worlds.
1.154.20	Then the Gandharvas, the Kalayas, who were in the middle, moved about, not caring for either of them.
1.154.21	The gods, the ancestors and men prevailed over the Asuras, Rakshas and Pisachas.
1.154.22	They divided these worlds. The gods took the world of the gods, the ancestors the world of the ancestors, and the men the world of men.
1.154.23	The Gandharvas, the measurers, came to them and said, "You are not sharing these worlds."
1.154.24	They said, "You have acted without regard for us, not for others."
1.154.25	Then they said, "We will dwell in your minds." They replied, "You will not share."
1.155.1	They said, "No, our worlds are well divided. We cannot tempt you."
1.155.2	They said this: "Whatever we see here, that will be ours."
1.155.3	They gave these rivers to them, saying, "They toil in these."
1.155.4	That is why the rivers are called Kalindas.
1.155.5	That Kalin saw this Sama, which is different from that.
1.155.6	He praised with it.
1.155.7	With it he saw this country of the Duryantas, the world.
1.155.8	He conquered it.
1.155.9	This is the Sama of the world-knower.
1.155.10	He who praises with this (hymn) obtains the world.
1.155.11	One does not surpass the Gandharva world.
1.155.12	One conquers the Gandharva-world as it were.
1.155.13	What Kali saw, that is why it is called Kali.
1.155.14	The gods, having performed the first two Savanas, went to heaven by performing the third Savana.
1.155.15	These worlds were separated, and the sacrifice was separated.
1.155.16	The gods desired: "Let us unite these worlds, let us unite the sacrifice."
1.155.17	They saw this Sama.
1.155.18	They praised with it.
1.155.19	With it they united these worlds, they united the sacrifice.
1.155.20	In that they united these worlds,
1.155.21	By that he conquers the world of Gandharvas.
1.155.22	The sacrifice is indeed a tree, the Stoma is the wealth-knowing one.
1.155.23	By means of the sacrifice and the Stoma, they indeed established these worlds, and they established the sacrifice.
1.155.24	By means the sacrifice and the stoma, the sacrifice becomes united with him, and these worlds, for him who knows this.
1.155.25	Soma indeed was the king of Kali.
1.155.26	His sacrifice becomes divine.
1.155.27	Just as a cow with a calf runs to it, so indeed does Indra come to that Soma at the time when they praise him.
1.155.28	Therefore, from this hymn, one should never be separated from Indra, and one's sacrifice should be with Indra and the gods.
1.155.29	One makes the sacrifice with Indra and the divine (gods) by means of this (hymn).
1.155.30	This is the Iḍa hymn for the Acchāvāka.
1.155.31	The Iḍā is indeed the animals.
1.155.32	It indeed stands firm in the animals.
1.156.1	There were indeed two Savanas in the beginning.
1.156.2	The gods indeed conquered through the two Savanas.
1.156.3	Having conquered them, they sat down according to their respective worlds. Indra came and said, "The three metres, the three breaths - prāṇa, apāna, and vyāna, these three worlds, and the gods are said to be three. Let us perform these three Savanas."
1.156.4	They said, "We cannot do it. We are exhausted by the previous work."
1.156.5	He said, "I am Indra. I shall create the third pressing for myself."
1.156.6	He created the third pressing for himself.
1.156.7	Indra is indeed the third pressing of the deities.
1.156.8	He whose praise is sung by Indra, he who knowing thus praises with the third pressing, his praise is sung by the deities.
1.156.9	The third pressing is indeed like a daughter.
1.156.10	The hawk, bringing the food, has eaten it.
1.156.11	That is indeed pressed down.
1.156.12	"With "the most pleasing" (they eat), they indeed please it with that."
1.156.13	"With "most intoxicating" (they eat) they indeed put the taste in it."
1.156.14	They pour down the water. They eat with the animal. They indeed nourish it with that.
1.156.15	The destroyer of Rakshas, the universal conqueror, has entered the womb of the two-spoked (wheel). This is the entry into the two earlier Savanas.
1.156.16	In them, the Gayatri verse is as explained in the Brahmanas.
1.157.1	Then the two-spokes-ending verse for the collection, for stability.
1.157.2	Man is stable on two feet.
1.157.3	The gods and the Asuras were competing.
1.157.4	They said, "Let us put together the two kinds of wealth that are here."
1.157.5	"Let the two kinds of riches be put together for those among us who win."
1.157.6	They put together the two types of wealth that they had.
1.157.7	The gods desired, "Let us win both kinds of wealth that have been put together."
1.157.8	They saw this Sama Veda.
1.157.9	Therefore they praised him.
1.157.10	Through him they won both wealth and the alliance.
1.157.11	What they won through him was the alliance and the alliance's nature.
1.157.12	He who knows this wins both wealth and the hostile enemy.
1.157.13	Then Aruṇi the horse said, "Indeed, he was the alliance.
1.157.14	In him alone was their wealth and alliance.
1.157.15	He (Agni) alone won that (Soma) for them.
1.157.16	They say, 'He (Agni) won that (Soma), indeed, for them.'
1.157.17	Then the gods became victorious, the Asuras were defeated.
1.157.18	He who knows this becomes victorious himself, his enemy and foe are defeated.
1.158.1	And indeed, the third pressing is as if cut off from the midday pressing.
1.158.2	The gods, having pondered over this, knew that the third pressing was as if cut off from the midday pressing.
1.158.3	They saw this Sama.
1.158.4	They composed it.
1.158.5	What they composed, that is the reason for the name of the Samhita.
1.158.6	For him whose third pressing is thus composed, it becomes uninterrupted. He who knows this.
1.158.7	Then the Uṣṇīka and Kakubha.
1.158.8	When Indra was standing on the Uṣṇika and Kakubha, he hurled the thunderbolt at Vṛtra. They did not hurl it at him.
1.158.9	He placed the four-footed animals under them: the cow, the horse, the goat, and the sheep.
1.158.10	They hurled it at him.
1.158.11	Standing on the Uṣṇik and Kakubha, he struck with the arms of Sabha and Pauṣkala.
1.158.12	He struck him.
1.158.13	He who knows this strikes his enemy, his foe.
1.159.1	He turned to the east with one foot, to the west with the other.
1.159.2	With the one by which he turned to the east, that became the Kakubha.
1.159.3	Therefore, in the eastern half of the Kakubha, there are more letters.
1.159.4	Now those who went to the west became the Uṣṇīja.
1.159.5	Therefore, in the lower half, there are more syllables.
1.159.6	These two are the metres, the cow and the bull.
1.159.7	Therefore, animals eat mostly in the front half and the lower half.
1.159.8	They carry in the front half, and they milk and generate in the lower half.
1.159.9	He who knows this, obtains both the milk of a cow and the milk of a buffalo.
1.160.1	Among them, the Sabha is for the sake of the assembly of the sacrifice.
1.160.2	Whatever is ill-sung, ill-praised, or ill-performed in the sacrifice, that is for the sake (of the Sabha).
1.160.3	Indeed, they praise with this (verse), 'May there be a peaceful assembly.'
1.160.4	Indeed, this (verse) is called 'Sabha'.
1.160.5	The gods, by means of the assembly, took away the brilliance, strength, energy, cattle, and food of the Asuras, and made themselves superior to the assembly.
1.160.6	That is the superiority of the assembly.
1.160.7	He who knows this makes himself superior to the assembly, to the brilliance, strength energy, cattle, food, and to the assembly of his enemies.
1.160.8	Prajapati created the animals.
1.160.9	They, having been created from him, fled.
1.160.10	He desired, "May my animals not flee, may they return to me."
1.160.11	He saw this Sama.
1.160.12	He praised with it.
1.160.13	Then the animals returned to him, then they became non-fleeing from him.
1.160.14	He said, "I have become a Sabha with animals."
1.160.15	That is the reason why Sabha is called Sabha.
1.160.16	One who knows this becomes a Sabha with cattle.
1.160.17	That is why it is called Kakubha Svaram.
1.160.18	Svaram is the breath, Kakup is the human metre.
1.160.19	Breath is the eldest, man is the eldest.
1.160.20	By means of seniority they establish that seniority, by means of seniority they stand in seniority.
1.160.21	And indeed they strengthen the sacrificer with the breath.
1.160.22	He who knows thus prospers.
1.160.23	He did not know them as of one form.
1.160.24	He saw this Puskalasama.
1.160.25	By means of that he defined their forms.
1.160.26	They became of various forms, white, red, and black.
1.160.27	But they were of one form before that, only red.
1.160.28	One who knows this obtains many animals of various forms and of many forms. One becomes the owner of many animals.
1.160.29	Now about Pauṣkala.
1.160.30	Pauṣkala Āṅgirasa, desiring animals, performed austerities.
1.160.31	He saw this Sama.
1.160.32	He praised with it.
1.160.33	Then he obtained the cattle.
1.160.34	This is the cattle-obtaining Sāman.
1.160.35	He who knows this obtains cattle and becomes a great cattle-owner.
1.160.36	Because Puṣkala Āṅgirasa saw it, therefore it is called Pauṣkala.
1.160.37	It has four verses as its end.
1.160.38	Cattle have four feet.
1.160.39	Cattle are Uṣṇīka.
1.160.40	For the purpose of enclosing the animals in the proper order.
1.161.1	If the metres were to be recited in the proper order, the Anushtubh would be the last.
1.161.2	The Anushtubh is speech.
1.161.3	They would place it outside the sacrifice.
1.161.4	They thus place it in the middle of the sacrifice.
1.161.5	These are the verses: "O ye who have conquered the front, O ye who have conquered in the middle, O ye who conquer in the rear, O ye who are victorious, O ye who will conquer, O ye who know the way, O ye who lead the way, O Indra, O Agni, O ye who bring the Soma, O ye who press the Soma, O Soma, O ye whose Soma is pressed, O ye who drink the Soma, O Indra, ye who drink the pressed Soma, O ye, O ye who give us wealth, O ye who bestow wealth, O ye, ye who are the bestowers of wealth, O ye whose wealth is bestowed, O ye who grant wealth, O ye Indra, O ye who make us rich, O ye who increase our wealth, O ye ye who are the increasers of wealth, O Indra, who are the increaser of wealth, O Agni, who are the giver of wealth, O Soma, who are the bestower of wealth, O Brhaspati, who are the bestower of wealth, O Mitra, who are the bestow
1.161.6	They go forth conquering evil, destroying evil in front of them.
1.161.7	Those who have conquered follow those who have conquered.
1.161.8	"They say, 'To the pressed, to the intoxicated, the dogs are bound, the friends, the long-tongued one.'
1.161.9	The Asura was indeed long-tongued.
1.161.10	She used to devour Soma after Soma,
1.161.11	The ocean is on the north.
1.161.12	He who offers on the southern ocean, he who offers on the eastern ocean, he who on the western ocean, he is seized by it.
1.161.13	Indra, desiring to seize it, was not able to grasp it.
1.161.14	He said, "No one should offer. This is the long-tongued one. It will seize Soma after Soma."
1.162.1	Then Sumitra Kautsya was seen.
1.162.2	He said to her, "You are handsome, but women are fond of handsome men. Try to kiss this long-tongued one."
1.162.3	She went to him and said, "Long-tongued one, desire me."
1.162.4	She said, "Your one fault is that you have no moustache on your body. That is not possible."
1.162.5	He returned and said, "One of your teeth is in my body. It is not right." She said, "This is what she said to me."
1.162.6	He said, "I will put your teeth in your body."
1.162.7	He covered them and went away.
1.162.8	She said, "Long-tongued one, desire me."
1.162.9	She said, "Your penis is in one place, my pubic hair in another. It is not possible."
1.162.10	"My penis is in every part of my body," he said.
1.162.11	"Let me see your penis."
1.163.1	She showed him her penis.
1.163.2	They made love to her.
1.163.3	He said, "Come."
1.163.4	"What is your name?"
1.163.5	"My name is Sumitra."
1.163.6	"May your name be auspicious," he said.
1.163.7	They met together.
1.163.8	And whatever he did for her, she took it to herself.
1.163.9	She said, "Did you not say, 'I am your friend'?"
1.163.10	He said, "I am your friend, but I am your enemy."
1.163.11	He saw these friendly things in common.
1.163.12	They praised him.
1.163.13	They called Indra.
1.163.14	He, Indra, ran with this Anushtubh thunderbolt.
1.163.15	"Purujit, your drinkers of the Soma, for the drinking of the Soma, you, the friends, have bound the dog, the long-tongued one." Thus he struck it.
1.163.16	These are the verses that destroy enemies and demons.
1.163.17	He destroys the enemy, the wicked one, the demon. He who praises with these verses destroys the enemy, his foe.
1.163.18	He who flows around with the flowing stream, the Soma, like a horse, difficult to be restrained, the Soma, the beloved of all, for the sacrifice, O ye who are not to be overcome. This is the approach to the two earlier Soma-pressings.
1.163.19	In them (is) Savāśva.
1.163.20	Having abandoned Śyavāśva, Ārcanānas, Samiddhāra, and Parīta, the participants in the sacrifice went to heaven.
1.163.21	He desired, "May I attain heaven and meet with the participants in the sacrifices."
1.163.22	He saw this Sama.
1.163.23	He praised with it.
1.164.1	"O Purujit, come to the Soma-pressing, O Soma, come to the drinking, come to the pressing, O Soma, O Soma, do thou come to the drinking. Come, O Soma, thou art the dog, come to the dogs.
1.164.2	" "He (Soma) is called 'he who comes' (iha-ā). The Maruts call him to the heavenly world."
1.164.3	From that time he went to the assembly of his enemies.
1.164.4	He, indeed, went with the Maruts.
1.164.5	This is the heavenly hymn.
1.164.6	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
1.164.7	Because Shyavasva saw Archanas, therefore he is called Shyavasva.
1.164.8	Indra, having become disgusted with the third pressing, departed.
1.164.9	For it was like a daughter.
1.164.10	The All-gods invoked him with this hymn: "O Ho, you who are."
1.164.11	Then Indra returned to the third pressing.
1.164.12	Then from this (earth) he did not depart.
1.164.13	This is the Indra-possessed Sāman.
1.164.14	He whose sacrifice is possessed of Indra, his sacrifice becomes possessed of Indra. Indra does not depart from his sacrifice. He who knows thus.
1.164.15	This becomes the Svaram.
1.164.16	Svaram is the breath.
1.164.17	Those who perform the sacrificial rite beyond the prescribed limit, or those who do not perform it, are deprived of life.
1.164.18	Who knows whether they perform it beyond the prescribed limit or not?
1.164.19	When it is performed as a Svāra rite, they prosper with life.
1.165.1	Then the Anthigava rite.
1.165.2	It has the middle as the final verse for stability.
1.165.3	Those who perform the Pavamāna of the Ārbhava (Sāman) cross the ocean without effort.
1.165.4	That it ends in the middle is for the sake of stability.
1.165.5	Just as one, having bathed in the ocean, having reached the island, having bathed again, rests and stays, so indeed, having reached this end, they rest and stay at will, being free from anxiety.
1.165.6	That is the Iḍa.
1.165.7	The Iḍa is indeed the cattle.
1.165.8	Cattle are the entire food.
1.165.9	He who goes on a journey without cattle does not attain it.
1.165.10	But he who goes with cattle attains it.
1.165.11	This indeed is the ocean without a beginning, namely this atmosphere.
1.165.12	There is no such way of going for him who goes without cattle, nor is there such a way.
1.165.13	Having thus made the entire food of the animals, they proceed.
1.165.14	Those who desire food and are desirous of food, initiated themselves.
1.165.15	Shaktya saw this Sama in the form of a blind man.
1.165.16	He praised it.
1.165.17	They perform the Viraj consisting of ten syllables in the middle of it.
1.165.18	Viraj consists of ten syllables.
1.165.19	Food is Viraj.
1.165.20	Then they obtained the food of Viraj.
1.165.21	This is the obtaining of the food of Viraja.
1.165.22	He who knows this obtains the food of Viraji, becomes the best eater of food among his kinsmen.
1.165.23	Because Andhigu Shaktya saw it, therefore it is called Andhiguvam.
1.166.1	Then these (verses) are recited: "He pours forth the dear (Soma) for the good, for the well-being."
1.166.2	Prajapati created the creatures.
1.166.3	They were created without breath.
1.166.4	He gave them breath with these very verses: "He pours down the dear (Soma), for the good, the well-being".
1.166.5	The creatures are dear.
1.166.6	They poured down with breath.
1.166.7	"The names of the young ones, on whom they grow."
1.166.8	The great ones are the names of the offspring.
1.166.9	"The great one has mounted the chariot of the great sun, the all-moving, the discerning."
1.166.10	The all-moving is indeed the life-force.
1.166.11	It moves everywhere.
1.166.12	These are the verses for longevity.
1.166.13	Having come to all life, one praises with these verses.
1.166.14	In them, there is a question:
1.166.15-20	The sage Bhārgava desired the immortal Gandharva world among the gods. He saw this Sama. He praised with it. Then he obtained the immortal Gandharvaloka among the gods. This is the Sama that knows the worlds. One who praises with this obtains the immortal Gandharvī world among the gods.
1.166.21	What the sage Bhārgava saw, from that it is called Kavya.
1.166.22	It becomes Svaram.
1.166.23	By Svaram, the food offering is given to the gods at the end.
1.166.24	It is equal to the Rk at the end of Pavamāna.
1.166.25	They do not exceed the Nṛca with the Sama, they do not exceed the Sama with the Nṛca.
1.166.26	Now, when one praises here and there in the Pavamāna (Sāman), it is for the sake of equality and equal attainment of this (Sāman).
1.166.27	The Gāyatrī verse has the same accent as the preceding verse. The Pavamāna (verse) has the same accent at the end.
1.166.28	Therefore, the vital airs are on both sides, the beings are above and below.
1.166.29	The boat which the father and son did not build, that does not succeed.
1.166.30	This boat is divine, namely the sacrifice.
1.166.31	The father and son are indeed the boat.
1.166.32	The boat is in front, the sacrifice is above, for the sake of success.
1.166.33	Therefore, when the slaves board the boat, the father and son board first.
1.166.34	These five metres are in the Ārbhava Pavamāna. There are seven Sāmans.
1.166.35	They make twelve.
1.166.36	Twelve months are a year.
1.166.37	There are five Sāmans in the Madhyandina Pavamāna, the seasons.
1.166.38	The months are in the Ārbbhava Pavamāna, and the seasons in the Madhyandinapāvamāna.
1.166.39	Now this sacrifice, when extended, is indeed the year.
1.167.1	Now this year is indeed Prajapati.
1.167.2	He indeed stands on one of the two feet, the six months.
1.167.3	When he takes up the heat, then it becomes hot above, and then it becomes cold below.
1.167.4	Therefore, in summer, heat is found above and cold below.
1.167.5	Therefore, in summer, they draw out the cold water from the wells.
1.167.6	And when he takes up the cold, then this becomes cold above and hot below.
1.167.7	Therefore in autumn, cold is found above and heat below.
1.167.8	Therefore, indeed, in the winter, they draw water from the well.
1.167.9	Thus indeed, this Prajapati, the year, supports the creatures.
1.167.10	And then indeed, they bring that Soma-oblation.
1.167.11	If the sacrifice of the Udgātṛ goes wrong or exceeds, then it is measured and goes to the world of Yama.
1.167.12	They say that he is seen in the assembly of Yama.
1.167.13	This is brought again by this (rite), because they bring this Soma-cake.
1.167.14	He should look at it, saying, "Whatever my mind has gone to, whatever has not come back to me, that the king Soma has placed in us again. He has placed it in my mind and my mind in him. May I not be separated from the life-giving verses and the share of the Sāman."
1.167.15	He should also look around the shadow for his own non-destruction.
1.167.16	Then one should put ghee in the eyes for the sake of nourishing the eyes.
1.167.17	That also is true knowledge.
1.167.18	He who does not see his own self, he would be without life.
1.167.19	Therefore, having brought more ghee from the truth, one should look at oneself all around for the sake of securing the whole life.
1.168.1	The Angirases, while seated at a sacrifice, had sand in their eyes.
1.168.2	They desired: "May we be blind and see."
1.168.3	They put this Soma-offering of black rice in their eyes.
1.168.4	With this mantra they placed it, with which they won the race, with which they conquered the hawk, the bird, the golden-winged one, which they call the eye of Aditi, the endless one. May Soma, the eye-seer, place that in me.
1.168.5	Then they became sightless and saw.
1.168.6	One who knows this becomes sightless and sees.
1.168.7	They say, "One should eat it or not eat it."
1.168.8	He who is a speaker of truth and yet is not famous should eat it.
1.168.9	"One who is not a speaker of truth is enough for fame here."
1.168.10	He who, though a speaker of truth, is not famous, his fame goes to that world.
1.168.11	This is what is meant by the statement that one eats the Soma-cake.
1.168.12	Satyayani said, "One should not eat it. Who would bring fame from there? One would be living in a place where the nights are longer."
1.168.13	Therefore one should not eat it at all.
1.169.1	This is the fourth part of the Samaveda.
1.169.2	They thus establish the sacrifice in the very midst.
1.169.3	This is the body of the Sāmans.
1.169.4	They thus make the Sāmans of the same body.
1.169.5	He who would go beyond this Sāman, would have a bad skin, or evil fame would overtake him.
1.169.6	This is Gāyatrī, having become the vital breath, it rises and falls from heaven.
1.169.7	The Anushtubh verses are the price paid for this true direction.
1.169.8	For him who knows this, his offspring are the price-payers, and the price is paid to him from the directions.
1.169.9	He recites the Prastara verse, "O Agni, you are the life of the sacrifices," and the Pratihara verse, "We praise you with our words, O most generous one, the immortal one, the one who knows the truth."
1.169.10	Two syllables are 'yajna' and two are 'giri' and two are ‘popri’.
1.169.11	They become six.
1.169.12	The silent praise has six syllables.
1.169.13	One is released from the Agni-Maruts through silent praise.
1.169.14	It is indeed within.
1.169.15	Agni Vaiśvānara rose up for the creatures.
1.169.16	He heated this entire (world).
1.169.17	The gods were afraid of his burning.
1.169.18	They said, "This one will burn everything."
1.170.1	"Let us drive away his destroyer."
1.170.2	They drove away his destroyer.
1.170.3	When they first drove him away, they debated about it, saying, "Where will this be?"
1.170.4	They said, "It will be at every sacrifice.
1.170.5	That became the Yajñāyajñiya.
1.170.6	That is why the Yajñayajñiya is called Yajñāyājñiya.
1.170.7	When they went away from the second, it became the Narmedha.
1.170.8	When they departed from the third, it became the Dasaspatya.
1.170.9	When they left the fourth, it became the Vishoshavishiya.
1.170.10	When they moved away from the fifth, it became the Varavantiya.
1.170.11	Agni indeed is the sacrifice.
1.170.12	And in that these are Agniṣṭoma Sāmans, they indeed establish Agni Vaisvānara in the Agniṣṭoma.
1.171.1	One should not perform the Narmadha or the Athakama.
1.171.2	Narmadha and Suvrata were brothers.
1.171.3	They made a pact with each other:
1.171.4	He sang the Nrimedha for Suvrata.
1.171.5	He sang it with the Yajnayajniya.
1.171.6	Then the two sons of the officiating priest of the sacrificer, Antakadhrti and Sauvrati, Nakira and Shakaputa, approached him.
1.171.7	He touched his arms and said, "This is your sacrifice. With it you may perform the sacrifice for whatever you desire. With this I shall certainly defeat him."
1.171.8	He bound him with a rope of hemp and stakes.
1.171.9	He desired, "May I go from here and find a protector. May not this fire burn me."
1.171.10	He saw this Sama.
1.171.11	He praised with it.
1.171.12	Then he found the song and the protector.
1.171.13	Fire did not burn him.
1.171.14	He even gave the metal that was wrapped around him.
1.171.15	This is the Sama that knows the song and the guardian.
1.171.16	He found the song and protector.
1.171.17	One who knows this finds the song and protector.
1.171.18	Because Nṛmedha saw it, therefore it is called Nārmedha.
1.172.1	One who desires lordship should perform the Dasaspatya (sacrifice).
1.172.2	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
1.172.3	The gods approached Indra, saying, "With you as our lord, we shall conquer."
1.172.4	Indra desired, "Let us conquer the Asuras."
1.172.5	He saw this Sama.
1.172.6	He praised with it.
1.172.7	Then the gods conquered the Asuras.
1.172.8	Then the Dasapatas came to him who was seated after victory and brought forth the Uddharas.
1.172.9	That itself is the state of being a Dasapati.
1.172.10	He who knows this is freed from the Uddhar.
1.172.11	One who desires food should perform the Vishoshavishiya.
1.172.12	Agni desired, 'May I be the lord of the people, the eater of food, the best.'
1.172.13	He saw this Sama.
1.172.14	He praised with it.
1.172.15	Then indeed he became the lord of the eaters of food, the eater of the food of the people, and the best.
1.172.16	Then the people served him.
1.172.17	In that the people served him, that is the reason for the name Visovishiy, Visovishiy.
1.172.18	He is indeed the lord of the clans, the eater of food, the best, the lord.
1.172.19	He who knows thus becomes the lord of the Clans, the eater of Food, the best, and the Lord.
1.172.20	One desiring cattle should perform the Vāravantīya rite.
1.172.21	Prajapati created cattle.
1.172.22	They, being created from him, fled.
1.172.23	He restrained them with the Vāravantyā rite alone.
1.172.24	That is why it is called Vāravantyīya.
1.172.25	That it is Vāravantyā is for the attainment of cattle, for the non-wandering of cattle.
1.173.1	He who knows the secret of the sacrifice milks the sacrifice that has been given.
1.173.2	The Yājyāyajñiyā is indeed the milking of the sacrifice.
1.173.3	These are his two breasts: Gāyatrī, Rathantara, Bṛhat, and Vāmadevya.
1.173.4	One should chant like Gāyatrī.
1.173.5	One should sing like Rathantara.
1.173.6	One should ascend like Bṛhat.
1.173.7	The Hinka is Vāmadevyā.
1.173.8	The Svayam is Yajñāyajñīya.
1.173.9	This indeed is the sacrifice that the sacrificer milks.
1.173.10	He becomes better by reciting it.
1.173.11	"It is said, "O Agni, the sacrifices, the sacrifices."
1.173.12	This indeed is the sacrifice, namely, the Yajñāyajñiya hymn.
1.173.13	"It carries the sacrifice, the sacrifice." This is the reason why it is called Yajñā-yajñiya.
1.173.14	Formerly all the hymns were recited with this.
1.173.15	They say, "Those who sacrifice ascend to the heavenly world."
1.173.16	They are powerful, going beyond the Atipatti."
1.173.17	When they praise with the Yajnyayajniya hymn above, this is the Yajnyajniya. They indeed stand on this.
1.173.18	They chant after having put down (the oblations) because the Yajñāyajñiya is indeed Agni Vaisvānara, for peace and non-injury to him.
1.173.19	He makes the wife move forward with her thighs.
1.173.20	He thus appeases Agni Vaisvânara.
1.173.21	He makes her move forward with her thigh as if naked.
1.173.22	For, making her thigh as if nude, the wife performs the act of begetting.
1.173.23	They count it for the one who is to beget semen.
1.173.24	They say, "The wife of the Udgātṛ gives birth to offspring when counting the Sāman in the absence of singing."
1.174.1	One should examine it thus: "The name is Vāma, we know all the things of Vāma."
1.174.2	Offspring is Vāma.
1.174.3	He thus places offspring within himself.
1.174.4	We have attained the seed of thy strength, O Vrishna, the most powerful. The other one looks back.
1.174.5	They say, "One should sing with a covering, for this is Agni Vaiśvānara, the Yajñāyajñiya. For his peace and non-burning."
1.174.6	But if one sings with a covering, one becomes the lord of the Pitṛ-deities.
1.174.7	Some say: One should sing covering the ears.
1.174.8	They say: One hears with the ears, one sees with the eyes.
1.174.9	Therefore one should cover oneself, if one sings uncovered.
1.174.10	They say that the third pressing is the blessing.
1.174.11	The blessing is the offspring, the cattle.
1.174.12	Therefore, one should sing with the body covered from all.
1.174.13	One should sing with the uncovered body.
1.175.1	The Vayo is the Yajñāyajñiya.
1.175.2	If one desires that the sacrificer should attain the heavenly world, one should recite this verse: "O Agni, you are the Vayu, the Yajnas."
1.175.3	Vayu, having become a bird, carries him to the heavenly world.
1.175.4	That is as if it were not conducive to longevity.
1.175.5	It is as if it is destroyed, as if it is without a home, as if it were youth.
1.175.6	Therefore one should not recite it like this.
1.175.7	"O Yira Yira, O Dakshasa."
1.175.8	If one were to say "O Gira Gira," then Agni Vaiśvānara would destroy the sacrificer.
1.175.9	Then when he says, "O Ira, O Ira, O Dakshasa," he means to say, "Food is Ira, food is Dakshasa." He thus places food at the mouth of Agni Vaisvānara.
1.175.10	If one is afraid of becoming emaciated, one should say, "O Ira..."
1.175.11	One should say, "Here is Ira..."
1.176.1	Thus indeed he does not become dry.
1.176.2	Now, indeed, those ancient Brahmanas pondered over this: "Who is it that today eats the gaping Shimshu-mara?"
1.176.3	This indeed is the Shimshu-mari in the Ekayana, standing with its mouth open towards the Yajayajniya.
1.176.4	It is she who, having covered the food with her mouth, passes by safely.
1.176.5	We are born, we are immortal.
1.176.6	If he were to say, "We are going forward," the sacrificer would be short-lived.
1.176.7	But when he says, "We are born," he becomes immortal.
1.176.8	"O you who are deceitful, give!"
1.176.9	If he were say, "Give!" the sacrificer would become a slave.
1.176.10	Now when he says, "To the giver," they say, "The sacrifice is to be sent to heaven." They indeed send the sacrifice, which has been praised, to heaven.
1.176.11	"I praise the dear friend."
1.176.12	If one were to say, "I praise the dear but not the friend," one would not praise the dear friend.
1.176.13	Then when he says, "I praise my dear friend," he praises his dear friend.
1.177.1	"I am going to praise my friends, the source of strength, for they are the life."
1.177.2	If he were to say, "They are not life," the sacrificer would not be long-lived.
1.177.3	Then when he says, "May I live," he places life in the Udgātṛ and the sacrificer.
1.177.4	"May I live, may I live, may the giver of oblations live."
1.177.5	If he were to say, "May I be a giver," he would become a giver of gifts.
1.177.6	When he says, "Let me live," he indeed lives.
1.177.7	"May I be the giver of wealth, the giver of food, the giver of cattle, the giver of horses, the giver of wealth in the contests, the giver of prosperity, the giver of abundance."
1.177.8	For now the sacrifice is like an old man.
1.177.9	"And the protector of many."
1.177.10	If he were to say "of bodies," the sacrificer would be like a body.
1.177.11	Now when he says, 'Of many,' he makes him a protector of many.
1.178.1	They say, 'The Yajñāyajñiya is one syllable less than a verse.
1.178.2	That is a gap in the sacrifice.
1.178.3	He who sings it without filling up makes a gap in the Yajñāyyajñiya.
1.178.4	The sacrifice flows along the Yajñāyajñiya, the sacrifice flows along the sacrifice, the sacrificer flows along the sacrificer, the offspring flow along the sacrificer.
1.178.5	One should place speech in that.
1.178.6	Speech indeed is Brahman.
1.178.7	"Indeed, speech is the protector of many, and it is said, 'speech is the protector of the many.'
1.178.8	Some indeed offer a cow."
1.178.9	A cow indeed is the entire food.
1.178.10	For the attainment of the entire food.
1.178.11	They say, one should not do this.
1.178.12	"What is the end of speech, by that it is bound."
1.178.13	They say, as before, as according to seniority, the verses being released, the creation of the verses, the release, the creation of beings, the end of the kalpas.
1.178.14	He recites with six syllables, "O Agni, your sacrifices."
1.178.15	And with the words "Dakṣas" he takes up the beginning with six syllables.
1.178.16	They become twelve.
1.178.17	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
1.178.18	They first enclose the Jagati for you.
1.178.19	They are released by the Jagati.
1.178.20	"We have attained the immortal one who knows" - the syllables become eleven.
1.178.21	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
1.178.22	They are released by the Tristubh.
1.178.23	"They conclude with eight syllables, saying, "I praise my dear friend."
1.178.24	The Gāyatrī has eight syllables.
1.178.25	They are released by the Gāyatrī.
1.178.26	Just as the metres are released in the proper order, so do the creatures follow the release of the metres. The one who dies first does not die again.
1.179.1	The gods and the Asuras competed in the sacrifice.
1.179.2	The gods defeated the Asuras in the sacrifice.
1.179.3	Those Asuras, having taken the essence and strength of the three Savanas, entered the darkness.
1.179.4	Whatever is beyond the Agniṣṭoma, that is the darkness.
1.179.5	What is beyond the year, that is the dark.
1.179.6	The sacrifice is as big as the Agniṣṭom.
1.179.7	The year is as big as this.
1.179.8	There are twelve Stotras in the Agniṣṭoma.
1.179.9	Twelve months are a year.
1.179.10	There are twelve Stotras and twelve Sastras.
1.179.11	There are twelves of the former half of the month and twelve of the latter half of the month.
1.179.12	What is beyond that is the blind darkness.
1.179.13	They entered that.
1.179.14	The gods attacked the Asuras.
1.179.15	The Asuras countered them with these very hymns.
1.179.16	When they countered with hymns, that is why the hymns are called Utkhas.
1.179.17	Then they struck them down.
1.179.18	They entered only darkness, only night.
1.179.19	Indra said, "Who will follow me and counter them?"
1.180.1	Varuna said, "I am."
1.180.2	Agni said, "I will hold your light."
1.180.3	They approached each other.
1.180.4	They recited one third of it.
1.180.5	With that they nourished the morning pressing.
1.180.6	Therefore they praise in the Agniyais.
1.180.7	The Indra-Varuna is praised.
1.180.8	Therefore they praise the Gāyatrī verses.
1.180.9	For the morning pressing is indeed Gāyatrī.
1.180.10	He alone said, "Who will follow me in this?"
1.180.11	"I will," said Brihaspati.
1.180.12	They followed him.
1.180.13	They recited one third of it together.
1.180.14	They filled up the midday pressing with that.
1.180.15	Therefore they chant the Aindri verses.
1.180.16	The Aindrābārhaspatya is praised.
1.180.17	Therefore they chant the Kakup verses.
1.180.18	For the Kakup is the midday pressing.
1.180.19	He said, "Who will follow me?"
1.180.20	Vishnu said, "I will."
1.180.21	They followed.
1.180.22	Let them recite the third one.
1.180.23	They have made the third pressing flourish.
1.180.24	Therefore they praise in the Iṣṭi for Indra.
1.180.25	The Anushtubh verses are praised for Indra and Viṣṇu.
1.180.26	Therefore they sing in Anushtubh.
1.180.27	For the third pressing is Anushtubh indeed.
1.180.28	They have thus kept them away from all.
1.180.29	Then the gods became victorious over the Asuras.
1.180.30	He who knows this becomes the self of his enemies, and his enemies become his self.
1.181.1	These three are the two-deity ones: Indra-Varuna, Indra-Brhaspati, Indra-Vishnu.
1.181.2	These are the six wish-yielding cows that they mentioned: a cow, a horse, a goat, a sheep, a grain of rice, and a grain of barley.
1.181.3	These six cows yielding what is desired stand near him, for him who knows this.
1.181.4	The sacrifice is indeed of this extent, as much as the Agniṣṭoma.
1.181.5	They say, "If the sacrifice is of this extent, then when the Agniṣṭomah has been completed, why are the hymns recited?"
1.181.6	He should say, "The verses are one syllable less than the Yajñāyajñiya."
1.181.7	That is the gap in the sacrifice.
1.181.8	They offer it to the gods.
1.181.9	They offer to the flowing ones.
1.181.10	Everything here flows and goes.
1.181.11	They place the sacrifice in him in the right way.
1.181.12	They offer in the Agniya ones.
1.181.13	Just as one would place the fires in the Agniya, so it is.
1.181.14	Or, he who would make one Agni present in many places, they would be many.
1.181.15	He who would make many of them present together as one, they would be one.
1.181.16	As he would put the fires into the Agni, so it is.
1.182.1	In them the horse is together.
1.182.2	The gods, desiring heaven, practised austerities.
1.182.3	They saw this Sama.
1.182.4	They praised with it.
1.182.5	Then he, having become a horse, carried them to the heavenly world.
1.182.6	They said, "Having gone to the heavenly world, did he go to the heavenly world together with the horse?"
1.182.7	That itself is the togetherness of the horse.
1.182.8	This is the heavenly Sama.
1.182.9	He who knows this attains the heavenly world. He who knows this attains
1.182.10	One who has an enemy should perform the Pramanihishthiyam.
1.182.11	Indra hurled the thunderbolt at Vritra.
1.182.12	He was not able to strike him.
1.182.13	When he saw him from behind, then he struck him.
1.182.14	He strikes his enemy, his foe, who knows thus.
1.182.15	Because he saw him from the rear, therefore it is called 'the most striking'.
1.182.16	One should perform the Satrasahi sacrifice for one whose victory is as if not won.
1.182.17	Indra conquered the Asuras.
1.182.18	He did not conquer them like you.
1.182.19	He desired, 'I shall conquer all the Asuras with the Sattra.'
1.182.20	He saw this Sama.
1.182.21	He praised with it.
1.182.22	With it he conquered all the Asuras in the Sattra.
1.182.23	In that he conquered all the Sura in the Sattra, that is the Satrasahiyasya (the Sattra-conqueror's) Satrasahiyasatva (Sattra-conquering).
1.182.24	He who knows this conquers his enemies in battle.
1.182.25	One who desires to be a Purodha should perform the Dāyodāsa rite.
1.182.26	The Agniya is for the Brahmana, the Indraya is for the Rajanya.
1.182.27	This is the Agniya Indraya Sama.
1.182.28	Brahma is Agni, Ksatra is Indra.
1.182.29	He supports the Ksatra with Brahma, the Brahma with the Ksatra.
1.182.30	Thus indeed, from this (country) the kingdom does not decline. The Purohita goes to him.
1.183.1	One who is possessed by a Rakshas should perform the Brahma-svara of the Harivarna.
1.183.2	The Angirasas went to the heavenly world from these worlds, following the Rakshas.
1.183.3	They desired, "Let us destroy the Rakshas."
1.183.4	He saw this Harivarna Angirasa Sama.
1.183.5	Therefore, he praises.
1.183.6	He thus removed the Rākṣasas from these worlds.
1.183.7	"He said, "May I be victorious in this world," from this world; "May I be superior in the sky," from the sky; "May I go to heaven," from the heaven."
1.183.8	Then they removed the Rākśasas from all these worlds and ascended to heaven.
1.183.9	Having removed the Rakshas from all these worlds, he ascends to heaven. He who knows this.
1.183.10	What Harivarna Angiras saw, from that it is called Harivarna.
1.184.1	One who desires protection should perform this.
1.184.2	From the Aptyas, he found water in the forest.
1.184.3	They found a well on the bank.
1.184.4	He did not want to descend from it alone or with another.
1.184.5	He descended from it with a third.
1.184.6	When they drank it, they were not satisfied. Then he enclosed it with the wheel of a chariot and let the cows graze on it.
1.184.7	He desired, "May I go from here and find a protector."
1.184.8	He saw this Sama.
1.184.9	He praised with it.
1.184.10	He attained the final verse with the words, "He with the moons."
1.184.11	Parjanya, the rain-god, flooded it from above.
1.184.12	For he had flooded the chariot wheel with water, with which it was covered.
1.184.13	This is the song and the protector, known by one who knows the song and the song-protector.
1.184.14	He found the song and the protection.
1.184.15	He who knows this finds the song and the support.
1.184.16	He found it by means of a verse.
1.184.17	Having rejected him, the two went back to the forest, one becoming a bear and the other a monkey.
1.184.18	That is the one that destroys enemies.
1.184.19	The two went back to being enemies of each other, as long as he made them into a bear and a monkey.
1.184.20	Then indeed for him the rain god showers only.
1.184.21	That is indeed the one that brings cattle.
1.184.22	He made them only cattle.
1.184.23	One who knows this obtains cattle and becomes one with many cattle.
1.184.24	Because Trita Aptya saw (this), therefore it is called Trita.
1.185.1	One desiring food should perform the Trikakubha (rite).
1.185.2	Indra gave the ascetics to the jackals.
1.185.3	Of these, three princes remained: Rāyovāja, Prithuraśmi, and Brihadgiri.
1.185.4	They praised Indra.
1.185.5	He said to them, "What do you desire, O princes, that you praise me?"
1.185.6	"O Maghavan, do not abandon us," they said.
1.185.7	He embraced them between his arms.
1.185.8-11	Those three directions of space hang down for him. These worlds, being together, are divided into three. He found food in them, divided into three. Those three directions of food hang down for these three worlds.
1.185.12	He thought, "If I were to obtain the food of these three worlds and three directions, I would bring these three directions."
1.185.13	He saw this Sama.
1.185.14	He praised with it.
1.185.15	With it he obtained the food of these worlds and three directions.
1.185.16	He brought these three directions.
1.185.17	Now, that these three worlds, the three directions, have obtained food, that is the reason why it is called Trikakubha.
1.185.18	This is the obtaining of food.
1.185.19	He who knows this obtains food, becomes the best among his kinsmen.
1.186.1	This is a hymn to Indra.
1.186.2	The verses are connected with Indra.
1.186.3	The Sama is connected with Indra.
1.186.4	Indra is the final (verse).
1.186.5	Three are the human organs: the self, offspring, and cattle.
1.186.6	He indeed takes possession of them through this (verse).
1.186.7	He said to them, "What is the desire of one? What is the desire of another? What is the purpose of another?"
1.186.8	He said, "I am desirous of wealth, of victory, and of cattle."
1.186.9	Therefore he gave him the Ida.
1.186.10	The animals are the Idā.
1.186.11	Then Pṛthurāśmi said, "I am desirous of the Kshatra."
1.186.12	He gave him the Kshatra.
1.186.13	He himself was Pṛthu Vainya.
1.186.14	Then Bṛhadgirī said, "I desire food."
1.186.15	He gave it to him.
1.186.16	Food is the Athakāra.
1.186.17	One desiring offspring should perform the Saubhara.
1.186.18	One should approach the final verse with "huḥ".
1.186.19	One desiring food should perform the Saumbhāra.
1.186.20	One should reach the final verse with “ūr”.
1.186.21	One desiring rain should perform the Saumbhara.
1.186.22	One should come to the final verse with 'hiḥ'.
1.186.23	One desiring to be taken up should perform the Sauṃbhāra.
1.186.24	One would reach the final verse by saying "ud".
1.186.25-33	One desiring heaven should perform the Saubhara. One should reach the end with "O". While the Bharadvāja-Ayana sages were seated at a sacrifice, they asked, "With which one should one recite for the sake of offspring?" "With the Saubhara," they said. "With which one for the sake of food?" "With Saubhara," "With which for rain?" "With which to be taken up?"
1.186.34-40	By Subhadra. By whom are the desires of heaven? By Subhadra. Thus indeed is this Sama. These are the desires in this (Sama). He obtains these very desires. Whatever desire one may have, if one praises with this Sama, that desire is accomplished.
1.187.1-6	One who desires that his progeny should be handsome, good-looking, of the form of a Kshatriya and of the form of man, should perform the Saura Brahmanical Sama. The progeny of a man is indeed splendour. The splendour is the Saura, the great. The great is the Kshatriya. This is the progeny of the Kshatriya.
1.187.7	Prajapati created the creatures.
1.187.8	They, created by him, became extinct.
1.187.9	That which is creeping and is other than serpents,
1.187.10	He created the second.
1.187.11	They became extinct for him.
1.187.12	They became fish.
1.187.13	He created the third.
1.187.14	They became extinguished for him.
1.187.15	Those became birds.
1.187.16	He created a fourth.
1.187.17	He thought, "How can these creatures that have been created by me not perish?"
1.187.18	He saw this Sama Veda.
1.187.19	He praised them with it, saying, "Energy!"
1.187.20	They became attached to his energy and grew.
1.187.21	He said, "I have indeed protected these creatures well."
1.187.22	That is the reason for the name "Soubhara".
1.187.23	He who knows this, bears a well-born progeny.
1.188.1	At the Atiratra, the priests praise the Udgātṛ.
1.188.2	They continue the night with the Iḍā.
1.188.3	They say, "Those who perform the Udgātārsāmā in the Uṣṇīṣa, they go to the Anushtubh."
1.188.4	One of them is the Arvāgushṇig, one is the Madhyoṣṇig, and one is the Puroṣṇig.
1.188.5	The metre is not determined.
1.188.6	Speech speaks without determination.
1.188.7	Speech is the Anushtubh.
1.188.8	They do not go by that Anushtubh,
1.188.9	The one that is the highest of these is the Anushtup.
1.188.10	They do go by that Anushthubh.
1.188.11	Just as the honey-makers collect the juices of the flowers, so these deities collected the juices of the metres.
1.188.12	The praise of the Chandas is sung with the Rasa of laughter, by one who knows this.
1.188.13	Indeed, this is the form of the Sama for the day and night.
1.188.14	The Richi is of Indra, the Sama of Agni.
1.188.15	The day is of Indra, and the night of Agni.
1.188.16	He who would go beyond this Sama of the Atiratra, would be separated from the form of the day and night.
1.188.17	He who would say to him, "He has gone beyond the form of day and night," it would be so.
1.188.18	Therefore, indeed, from this Sāman, one should not go beyond the Atiratra.
1.189.1	For the night is indeed more extensive than the day.
1.189.2	"Come, it is yours," for non-deviation.
1.189.3	What is beyond the Rk and the Saman, that became the Udvasaniya.
1.189.4	He who knows this stands firm in the Rk and Saman.
1.189.5	One should do it for the non-violent, not for the violent.
1.189.6	For the violent one has a limited life, while the non-violent one has an unlimited life, and the unlimited is indeed to be secured.
1.189.7	Now, indeed, with this Sama, the gods, like a bamboo, attacked the Asuras.
1.189.8	In that they attacked the Asuras like a bamboo, that is the reason for the name of the Udvashiyas.
1.189.9	He who knows this conquers the unconquered and does not lose what is conquered.
1.189.10	This is the form of all the Prstha Samas.
1.189.11	They sing thee with the Gāyatrī metre, they sing thee with the Gayatra metre.
1.189.12	They worship thee with the Arka metre, they worship thee with the Arka metre.
1.189.13	The Brahmans invoke thee with the Brihat metre, they invoke thee with the Brhat metre.
1.189.14	Like a rising stalk, like a rising stalk, they go.
1.189.15	Like a stalk rising again and again, they go. Like a stalk rising again.
1.189.16	The great names, they go. They go.
1.189.17	"Ma iras" is the name of the Revati stars.
1.189.18	"Ha yi" is the name for Vamadevya.
1.189.19	In this way, at the end of the sacrifice, one stands firm in the entire form of the hymn, in the juice, in the invincible splendor, and in the Chhandas.
1.190.1	For indeed, the entire (sacrifice) is sixteenfold, where the Udbanshiya (hymn) is performed.
1.190.2	One again recites the last verse.
1.190.3	It is performed in the form of the Sodasi.
1.190.4	The sixteen-fold (verse) is indeed a thunderbolt against the enemy.
1.190.5	He indeed strikes the enemy with the thunderbolt, for the purpose of covering (him).
1.190.6	Darkness was between the gods and the Asuras.
1.190.7	The gods saw this half-verse.
1.190.8	They conquered with it.
1.190.9	One should mentally meditate on the one whom one hates.
1.190.10	One should recite this half-verse; he goes away.
1.190.11	It flows for half a Danda.
1.190.12	From it the streams flow down.
1.190.13	Sāvayasa performed the Atiratra with Asādha.
1.190.14	And indeed, Ati-dhanvan Shaunaka was engaged in it.
1.190.15	He composed the Udbanshiya Atiratra and the Chāvāka-sāman.
1.190.16	He said, "Do not do so. The Veda is incomplete and the Svaras are not fixed. The form of service is not established."
1.190.17	He said, "We will go to that complete Iḍā and proceed through the night with Svaras alone."
1.190.18	The other said, "No."
1.190.19	Indra conquered the Asuras with this Sama.
1.190.20	Having recognized his strength and voice, they attacked him.
1.190.21	He fought them.
1.190.22	He killed him with the Ardhaedha.
1.190.23	"The Ardhaedha is indeed for protection."
1.191.1	Only the Ardhaedham should be performed.
1.191.2	It becomes the Aedha.
1.191.3	Aedha is cattle.
1.191.4	They indeed drove them away from the night with cattle.
1.191.5	Therefore only the Ardhaedh should be performed.
1.191.6	One who desires prosperity should perform the rite of the eighteen-toothed one.
1.191.7	The eighteen-toothed Vaivāruṣa saw these two Sāmans after the other sages.
1.191.8	He feared, "My Sāmans will be without praise."
1.191.9	He said, "May he prosper who offers Soma to my Sāmans."
1.191.10	These two Sāmans are indeed offered by the sages.
1.191.11	Those who praise with these (verses) indeed obtain (prosperity).
1.191.12	Vairupo, having eighteen teeth, desiring cattle, practised austerities.
1.191.13	He saw these two Sāmans.
1.191.14	He praised with them.
1.191.15	He approached this Ida.
1.191.16	Ida is cattle.
1.191.17	Then he indeed obtained cattle.
1.191.18	These are the two Sāmans for cattle.
1.191.19	He who knows this becomes one who has many cattle.
1.191.20	Because the one with eighteen teeth saw Vaírupa, therefore they are called the ones with eighteen teeth.
1.191.21	It is the Iḍa of the Acchāvāka.
1.191.22	The Iḍa is cattle.
1.191.23	One indeed stands firm in cattle.
1.192.1	When Prajapati divided the body among the gods, he gave the one that was most beautiful to himself.
1.192.2	He gave it to Indra.
1.192.3	By it Indra attained seniority.
1.192.4	That is why they praise the Harivati verses, for they indeed attain seniority.
1.192.5	The Harivati verses are the anuṣṭubh verses in the reverse order.
1.192.6	They are thirty-four syllables when praised.
1.192.7	Then they say that the world is determined by those thirty-four syllables of the Sama.
1.192.8	If they praise in thirty-five syllables, they attain the supreme form, the Bharata.
1.192.9	If they prasie in thirty-three syllables, they attain another form, the Anushtubh.
1.192.10	If the Stoma were to be seventeen, they would attain the supreme form.
1.192.11	If the Stoma were fifteen, they would attain an inferior form.
1.192.12	When they praise with the sixteen-fold Stoma and the sixteen-fold hymn in the thirty-four-fold verses, they then enrich it with its own place.
1.192.13	By means of that prosperity, he becomes prosperous among his own people.
1.192.14	There are sixteen Stotras and sixteen Shashtras.
1.192.15	That makes thirty-two.
1.192.16	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
1.192.17	The Anushtabh is sixteen, and the Anushtubh is accomplished.
1.192.18	Some were the metres of the gods, others were the metres of demons.
1.193.1	The one-syllabled was the lowest among the gods, the seven-syllabled the highest.
1.193.2	The nine-syllabled among the Asuras was the lowest, the fifteen-syllabled highest.
1.193.3	The gods desired, "May we conquer the Asuras with the lesser."
1.193.4	They won the fifteen-syllabled (verse) with the one-syllabled, the fourteen-syllabled with the two-syllabled; the thirteen-syllabled verse with the three-syllabled and the twelve-syllabled one with the four-syllabled. The eleven-syllabled was won with the five-syllabled while the ten-syllabled won with the six-syllabled.
1.193.5	The reason why they became sixteen is that they became sixteen.
1.193.6	It became the seventeen-fold Gāyatrī.
1.193.7	Therefore they say, "Prajapati is seventeen."
1.193.8	Indra wanted to kill Vritra.
1.193.9	He approached Prajapati, saying, "I want to kill Vrittra."
1.193.10	Therefore he gave him the sixteen-fold thunderbolt, taking whatever valour he had, the Sakkhas.
1.193.11	He was unable to destroy it.
1.193.12	He again attacked it, saying, "It is only wealth."
1.194.1	The Sakkhas gave it to him.
1.194.2	Then Indra killed Vritra.
1.194.3	He who knows this destroys his enemies.
1.194.4	He thought, "If I give it to him during the day, his enemies will look down on him at night."
1.194.5	"If I give it at night, his enemies will be looking down on him during the day."
1.194.6	He saw that as much as the sun is stretched out, he gave him that much.
1.195.2	The three-fold is the thunderbolt.
1.195.3	The sixteen-fold is the vajra.
1.195.4	Some say that it should be made fifteen-fold.
1.195.5	The fifteen-fold is the Vajra.
1.195.6	The sixteenfold is the Vajras.
1.195.7	Some say it should be made sixteenfold.
1.195.8	The five-fold is the Thunderbolt.
1.195.9	Indra, rising with the thunderbolt, is sixteen.
1.195.10	"With the thunderbolt of Indra, he slays the wicked Vrtra."
1.195.11	He who knows this slays his wicked enemy with the thunderbolt of Indra.
1.195.12	Some say, "It should be performed with seventeen."
1.195.13	The thunderbolt is fifteen.
1.195.14	Indra is the rising of the thunderbolt, sixteen.
1.195.15	Prajapati is seventeen.
1.195.16	He is the performer, he is the protector, he is the saluter. Strike! Destroy! Do not retreat!'
1.195.17	With Indra's thunderbolt, with Prajapati, he strikes the evil Vritra.'
1.195.18	He who knows this indeed strikes the evil enemy with Indra's thunderbolt and Prajapati.
1.195.19	Some say, 'It should be done only once.'
1.195.20	Indra hurled the thunderbolt at all the seven Hotr-priests. There are three each for the three Hotr-priesthoods.
1.195.21	It became one with twenty-one and sixteen.
1.195.22	With that Indra killed Vritra.
1.195.23	He who knows this kills his enemy, his foe.
1.195.24	Yāmana Bhṛtalāyana said: This is the sixteenfold prosperity of Viraj.
1.195.25	Viraj is the sixteenth.
1.195.26	Viraj, Viraj, established.
1.195.27	Wherever one may think of this Viraj as being accomplished, there one should praise it with this (hymn).
1.196.1	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a contest with each other.
1.196.2	The gods conquered the day.
1.196.3	Then the Asuras attacked the night.
1.196.4	The gods said, "We have half of the world. How shall we conquer the night by means of the sacrifice? We shall yoke."
1.196.5	They yoked.
1.196.6	They yoked themselves in the afternoon of the day.
1.196.7	Then the Asuras, having gone away in the night, yoked themselves in its morning.
1.196.8	This indeed is the afternoon of the Day, when it is evening.
1.196.9	This is indeed the first half of the night, when it is evening.
1.196.10	Others were settled on their own boundaries.
1.196.11	The metres were their own.
1.196.12	They were settled in the metres.
1.197.1	The lowest among the gods was one-syllabled, the highest seven-syllabled.
1.197.2	The lowest of the Asuras was nine-syllabled and the highest fifteen-syllabled.
1.197.3	The seven-syllabled and the nine-syllabled ones remained in the vicinity, while the others were in the vicinity.
1.197.4	Prajapati stood in the middle of them, having stepped over them.
1.197.5	They stood looking at each other, desiring each other's weakness.
1.197.6	Those gods approached Prajapati, saying, "We have conquered the enemies."
1.197.7	He gave them this sixteen-syllabled thunderbolt, saying, "With this, having united the metres with the metres, you should accomplish me."
1.197.8	They united the fifteen-syllabled with the one-syllabled, and the fourteen-syllabled (metre) with the two-syllabled.
1.197.9	It became Anushtubh.
1.197.10	They made that Prajapati peaceful.
1.197.11	With three syllables, the thirteen-syllabled (verse), with four syllables, the twelve-syllabled.
1.197.12	It became with Anushtubh.
1.197.13	They made that Prajapti peaceful.
1.197.14	With five syllables, the eleven-syllabled, with six syllables, the ten-syllabled
1.197.15	It became with Anuṣṭubh.
1.197.16	They pacified that Prajapati.
1.197.17	With the seven-syllabled (verse) he (Prajapati) made the nine-syllabled one, and with the eight (verses) the eight.
1.197.18	It became Anushtubh.
1.197.19	They brought Prajapati to rest.
1.197.20	Having thus combined the metres with the metres, they released their wives.
1.197.21	From those released wives, Prajapati, having become a reddish-brown horse, fled away.
1.197.22	They are found in the Uddānas.
1.197.23	Then indeed the gods became victorious over the Asuras.
1.197.24	He who knows this becomes victorious over his own self, and his enemy becomes defeated.
1.198.1	The gods were fewer, the Asuras were more.
1.198.2	They won the more by the fewer.
1.198.3	Therefore the smaller village is united with the larger village.
1.198.4	Therefore the smaller ones conquer the larger enemies.
1.198.5	He who knows this conquers the larger with the smaller.
1.198.6	This indeed is the actual Panctika, that it has five syllables and five feet.
1.198.7	They praise with the Sodasi in the Panctika.
1.198.8	The Pankti is the desire of the person.
1.198.9	The person is fivefold, and from the person they produce the desired speech.
1.198.10	Therefore a person speaks all speech.
1.198.11	Now all speech is indeed obtained.
1.198.12	And in that they praise in the Anushtup, it is like one would run to the great oceans in the pots of soup. That is so.
1.198.13	The lesser metres are found in the greater metres.
1.198.14	The lesser metres are those which have conquered the greater ones.
1.198.15	Therefore they are found in the lesser metres.
1.198.16	This indeed is the most powerful of the metres, which has three syllables and one foot.
1.198.17	When they begin with these metres, it is for the sake of obtaining power.
1.198.18	He sings the Nidhana (hymn) in a very high tone.
1.198.19	The gods, indeed, passed beyond the night in the day.
1.198.20	He who knows this conquers the world of his enemies.
1.198.21	For the night is indeed like a receptacle of enemies.
1.199.1	They buy Soma after having heard (the price).
1.199.2	As if mounted on the ear, so is the Sodasi (hymn) among the hymns.
1.199.3	Those who say, "We do not buy the Soma for sixteen," do not buy the sixteen.
1.199.4	When the Soma is bought by the one who has more than one ear, then by that very one the sixteen are bought and are secured.
1.199.5	They buy Soma with the one who has one ear.
1.199.6	They exceed the Soma at each pressing.
1.199.7	They praise in the Janadvatis.
1.199.8	All the forms are praised.
1.199.9	Having heard this, they buy Soma. The sacrificer generates him through that.
1.199.10	When they exceed Soma from one pressing to another, the Adhvaryu generates him through that
1.199.11	When they praise in the songs of the people, the Udgātṛ generates him through that.
1.199.12	All forms praise him. He generates him with that.
1.199.13	These are the sixteen kinds of generation.
1.199.14	He who knows this is born with offspring and cattle.
1.200.1	Indra was surpassed by Hara.
1.200.2	He said to the gods, "How can I not be surpassed by Hara?"
1.200.3	The All-gods said to him, "We shall praise you with the hymn of the Harivatsa; then Hara will not overpower you."
1.200.4	The All-gods praised him with the hymn of Harivatsa.
1.200.5	Then Hara did not overpower Indra.
1.200.6	When they praise Indra with the Harivatsas, they indeed make him prosper with the Haras.
1.200.7	This indeed is the nearest deity of the sacrificer, namely Indra.
1.200.8	When they praise him in the verses containing the word 'hara', they indeed make the sacrificer prosper with wealth and energy.
1.200.9	He who knows thus prospers.
1.201.1	The sixteenth (verse) is indeed like a thorn among the Stotras.
1.201.2	If the Prastara is not employed, it cuts off the sacrifice or it is not employed.
1.201.3	The last Stotra is complete.
1.201.4	Just as one would employ the Prastara and Prastariya, so here in the earlier Stotras he employs the Sodashin for the purpose of not cutting off.
1.201.5-10	The Sodashin is indeed the eye of the Stotras. The last Stotra is performed with the full-moon Soma-pressing. The Sodashin is the eye of the stotras. The Sodashi is indeed the eye. The last stotra is performed with full moon Soma pressing. The Ukthas are indeed the animals. The Sodasi is the thunderbolt.
1.201.11	When they praise with the sixteen verses at the end of the Ukthas, they then take possession of the cattle with the thunderbolt, for the purpose of preventing their going away.
1.201.12	He whose wealth is not taken away by others, knows this.
1.202.1	They say, "The sixteen verses should not be performed in the Uktha."
1.202.2	The Ukthas are cattle.
1.202.3	The sixteen verses are the thunderbolt.
1.202.4	One should not turn the thunderbolt against cattle.
1.202.5	The Atiratra should be performed.
1.202.6	Water is the peace of everything.
1.202.7	They pacify him with water.
1.202.8	If the Soma is to be used for an attack, one should make a golden thunderbolt with a sharp point and direct it towards the one who is performing the rite.
1.202.9	He strikes him with that very thunderbolt for covering.
1.202.10	When the Soma has been placed, he cuts off the neck of the Drona-vessel, and makes men out of the chaff or out of green grass, and cuts off the neck with the name of each of them, saying, "I cut off the neck of so and so; I cut off the neck (of) so and so; so and so."
1.202.11	He cuts off the neck as many times as he takes the names.
1.202.12	He gives it to Brahman.
1.202.13	Brahman is Brahman.
1.202.14	Brahma is the thunderbolt.
1.202.15	He thus establishes the thunderbolt in Brahman.
1.203.1	Indra and Brihaspati were together.
1.203.2	Brihaspati surpassed Indra with one body.
1.203.3	He feared, "She will overcome me."
1.203.4	He said to the gods, "Let this be the sixteen-fold sacrificial rite."
1.203.5	They said, "So be it."
1.203.6	It became sixteen-fold.
1.203.7	That is the origin of the sixteen-fold (rite).
1.203.8	One who knows this conquers his hateful enemy through excess of glory. Praising with the Gāyatrī verses having two feet and the sixteen-fold Brihatī.
1.203.9	"Come to us with the tawny ones, the sungod" - these are the Gāyatrī verses with two feet.
1.203.10	Indra wanted to kill Vṛtra.
1.203.11	He approached Prajapati, saying, "The wealth of Vṛtra."
1.203.12	He gave him this Apaharasa Anushtubh.
1.203.13	With that he did not succeed.
1.203.14	When he succeeded and roared, it became the Nānada.
1.203.15	Therefore, the non-Nānada is not Nānada.
1.203.16	Therefore, they say, "The Nānada should be performed with sixteen verses, for one does not attain it with that."
1.203.17	And he again attacked Vṛtra, who was different.
1.203.18	He created and gave to him the seven Hotr priests.
1.203.19	Three each for the Hotr priest.
1.203.20	It became twenty-one, with the sixteen verses.
1.203.21	Indra killed Vritra with it.
1.203.22	He who knows this, kills his enemy, his foe.
1.203.23	The sixteen-fold (rite) indeed has twenty-one bases.
1.203.24	Seven Hotr priests perform the Vasat call at the morning pressing, seven at the midday pressing, and seven at the third pressing.
1.203.25	And what Haro made and gave to him,
1.204.1	Gaurivitti saw this excess of Brahma.
1.204.2	It became Gaurivitti.
1.204.3	This is the excess of Brahma, namely Gaurivitti; the sixteenth is the excess of the hymns.
1.204.4	When they praise with Gaurivitti and the sixteenth, they place the excess in the excess, for the unity of the sacrifice.
1.204.5	Upodhiti said: Gaupalaya, with the Anushtubh, praised Nanadam; with the Gaurīvit, the Sodashin; and with the glory, he did not fall.
1.204.6	He who knows this does not fall through glory.
1.204.7	This is indeed a means for the prosperity of offspring.
1.204.8	One desiring cattle should perform the Sodashin Sama in the Shakaris.
1.204.9-15	The Sodasi is indeed the thunderbolt. The Sakvaris are the animals. One indeed wins the animal with the thunderbolt. One becomes possessed of animals. One should perform the Sodasi Saman in the Sakvaris for one who desires, "May I be the thunderbolt." The Sodasi is indeed a thunderbolt. The thunderbolt is the Sakvaris. One indeed gains the thunderbolt with the thunderbolt. One becomes the thunderbolt.
1.204.16	One who desires food should perform the Sodasi (sacrifice) at Viraj.
1.204.17	The Sodasi is indeed a thunderbolt.
1.204.18	Food is Viraj.
1.204.19	One indeed obtains food with the thunderbolt, eats food and becomes a food-giver.
1.204.20	Those (verses) become thirty-three syllables.
1.204.21	From that, the twenty-one (verses) are the foundation.
1.204.22	Then the twelve (verses) are procreation.
1.204.23	He who knows this stands firm in the foundation, is born and not destroyed in the foundation.
1.205.1	"You all, for your great growth, bear (the Soma)." These are the Virajas.
1.205.2	One should perform the Sodasi Saman in the Anushtup metre, if one desires that one's speech should not exceed the honour.
1.205.3	The Sodasi is indeed the thunderbolt.
1.205.4	Speech is Anushtup.
1.205.5	He touches speech with the thunderbolt, no other speech overpowers him.
1.205.6	"Stand up, O slayer of Vritra, on the chariot," these are the Anushtubh verses.
1.205.7	These are the three-syllabled verses, having one foot, "Vishnu's metre, the Bhuris, the Shakas."
1.205.8	With these Indra killed Vritra, with these he attained prosperity. With these
1.205.9	He who knows this slays his enemy, the foe, and attains prosperity.
1.205.10	They praise with the Sodashin (hymn) giving gold as a gift.
1.205.11	They make it luminous with the Sodashina.
1.205.12	The horse stands up for the Sodashin.
1.205.13	And they stand destroying the world of their enemies.
1.205.14	Because he was born, there is no other greater one. He who became the lord of all worlds, the lord of creation, rejoicing with offspring, he moves in the three luminaries, he looks at the sixteen-fold Graha.
1.205.15	Indra and Samraḍ Varuna, the king, have eaten this food first. I eat the food after them. May the speech of the Soma be pleased.
1.205.16	The one-syllabled was the lowest among the gods, the seven-syllabled the highest.
1.205.17	The nine-syllabled were the lowest among the Asuras, the fifteen-syllabled highest.
1.205.18	The gods desired, 'May we be more numerous than the Asuras.'
1.205.19	They won the fifteen-syllabled (verse) with the one-syllabled, the fourteen-syllabled with the two-syllabled; the thirteen-syllabled verse with the three-syllabled and the twelve-syllabled one with the four-syllabled. The eleven-syllabled was won with the five-syllabled while the ten-syllabled won with the six-syllabled.
1.205.20	In the same way, the younger one conquers the elder, the enemy, who knows this.
1.206.1	The Asuras were driven out of the day and entered the night.
1.206.2	The gods brought forth this thunderbolt with the Anushtubh head.
1.206.3	With that they pursued them.
1.206.4	This is indeed speech.
1.206.5	With speech they pursued the light.
1.206.6	This is the Viraj.
1.206.7	The Viraj shines forth, following the Jyotis.
1.206.8	The Atiratra is not like the Suyajna.
1.206.9	In that there is a Pantan, it is by that that the sacrifice is performed, for the connection of the day and the continuity of the night without interruption.
1.206.10	The metres that carry the day carry the night. This is the Gāyatrī, this is the Virāj, this is the Kakub, this is the Anushtubh.
1.206.11	They praise in the Brihatī verses.
1.206.12	By that they do not go to the Brihatī.
1.206.13	Since the Brihatī has twelve syllables in each foot, by that they do not proceed to the Jagatī.
1.206.14	He makes the Vasat-call in the Tristubh metre.
1.206.15	By that he does not go to the Tristubh.
1.206.16	They fled to the junction, and went to the Aśvinī (verses) which cannot be destroyed.
1.206.17	He who knows this conquers his hateful enemy.
1.206.18	This is the completion of the Agniṣṭoma.
1.206.19	There are twelve Stotras in the Agniṣṭomah, twelve in the night.
1.206.20	This is completion of the Ukthya.
1.206.21	There are three Ukthas, the junction is threefold.
1.206.22	This is the union of the Agniṣṭoma and the year, namely, the night.
1.206.23	There are twelve Agniṣṭoma stotras, and twelve months in a year.
1.206.24	The night is added as the thirteenth month.
1.206.25	This is indeed the expanse of the growing (year), namely, the night;
1.206.26	He who knows this goes to the expanse of the expanding (year).
1.207.1	This indeed is the all-Gayatra, namely, the Atiratra.
1.207.2	The day is not without the night, nor the night without the day.
1.207.3	None of these worlds is alone.
1.207.4	The day and night produce all this, these worlds, the past, the present, and the future.
1.207.5	They say, "The sacrificer should not offer the Atiratra sacrifice first."
1.207.6	For he would be proud of his own (sacrifice) and of two sacrificial rites.
1.207.7	The Agniṣṭoma is indeed Brahman.
1.207.8	Brahman is the Brahman's own.
1.207.9	He thought that he had won the Agniṣṭoma, the Ukthya and the Ṣoḍaśa.
1.207.10	They say that one wins only the Agniṣṭomam at the Agniṣṭom, the Ukthyama at the Ukthya, and the Ṣodaśi at the ṢoDaśa.
1.207.11	"By night he has obtained all."
1.207.12	He who, knowing this, extends four sacrificial rites by one sacrificial rite, four heroes are born to him, and he stands firm in all animals.
1.208.1	The Asuras were driven out by day and entered the night.
1.208.2	The gods saw these common ones, these alternatives.
1.208.3	They attacked them.
1.208.4	They killed them in turn.
1.208.5	Because they killed them in turn, that is why the turn of the turns is called turn.
1.208.6	He who knows this kills his enemy who hates him in turn.
1.208.7	Those who were hidden by the first night, they killed them in the first turn.
1.208.8	The first set of verses is the first set of verses, and the first set of people are the first set of victims. Those who were killed in the first watch of the night are killed by that (set of verses).
1.208.9	Those who were killed in middle watch of the night were killed by the middle set of verses.
1.208.10	The middle set of verses is again the middle set of people, and those who were killed in mid-watch of the night are again killed by that (middle set of verses).
1.208.11	Those who were hidden by the last watch of the night, he killed by the last watch.
1.208.12	The last watch of the last watch of night are the first ones again. Those who were hidden in the last watch of that night, he killed them by that.
1.208.13	He killed them again and again.
1.208.14	It is as if one kills and then kills again.
1.208.15	He who knows this slays his enemy, the assailant, again.
1.209.1	The night is called "Sarvari".
1.209.2	The gods said, "It was indeed in the Sarvari that we were."
1.209.3	That is why the Sarvari nights are called "Sarvari" nights.
1.209.4	He for whom it happens in the Sarvari, he for whom it happens indeed in the Sarvaris, he for whom this happens in the Sarvarī, he for whom indeed this happens in the Sārvarīs, he for whom there is this in the Sarvarīs, he who knows this, for him it happens in the Sārvārīs.
1.209.5	This was the first among the Asuras.
1.209.6-11	The gods said to Abhijit, "By what shall we join the day and night together above?" They saw this Rathantara as the joining. By that they joined the day and night above. What they joined together, that is the joining of the joining. The Ashvina is indeed the praise of the joining. They praise with the joining at the great night.
1.209.12	The Aśvina is praised at the rising of the sun.
1.209.13	For the continuity of day and night, for the commencement of day and night.
1.209.14	The gods conquered day and night. They made the thunderbolt their boundary for the protection of cattle and for the non-incursion of the Asuras.
1.209.15	Now, when these Uṣṇīsa are performed at the end, the Uṣṇīsas are indeed the thunderbolt. By means of the thunderbolt, they indeed encompass the animals for protection against loss.
1.209.16	He whose wealth is not taken away by others, knows this.
1.210.1	Indeed, this was in the Asuras.
1.210.2	The gods, having conquered, said, "Let us share this."
1.210.3	They did not succeed in dividing it.
1.210.4	They said, "Let us run a race."
1.210.5	They ran a race.
1.210.6	Agni's chariot was the first, then that of Uṣas, then that of the Asvins.
1.210.7	The Asvins, the horse-owners, won the race.
1.210.8	As they were running, Agni stood around them.
1.210.9	They said, "Let him release us."
1.210.10-15	No, he said, do not divide me. They said to him, "The third one is ours." "Tell us," he said. "So be it," they said. As they were running, the dawn stood before them. They said, "Release us." "No," he said, "do not divide me.
1.210.16	They said, "The third one is ours." They said, "It should be told to us."
1.210.17	They said, "So be it." They went away.
1.210.18	They won.
1.210.19	He who knows this victory of the Ashvins, wherever he desires, "May I win here," he wins there.
1.211.2	Those gods conquered the day.
1.211.3	Then the Asuras entered the Rk and the night.
1.211.4	Those gods said, "We have become the owners of half of this world.
1.211.5	How can we conquer the night by means of a treaty?
1.211.6	We will conquer with jewels."
1.211.7	They said to Agni, "For your metre."
1.211.8	To Indra, "For your praise."
1.211.9	To Prajapati, "For your prosperity."
1.211.10	"With your abode" - to the All-gods.
1.211.11	"What I said to Agni, for your metre" - therefore they praise in Gāyatrī verses.
1.211.12	"What was said to Indra, for your praise" - therefore the Stoma of the night is fifteen.
1.211.13	"What is said to Prajapati, for your prosperity" - therefore the Anushtubh is prosperous.
1.211.14	The gods said to the Viśve Devas, "In your abode." Therefore, they are praised in the Jagati metre.
1.211.15	They fled with the Samdhi.
1.211.16	In the Āśvina month, he went to the invincible.
1.211.17	He who knows this goes to the invincible enemy.
1.212.1	The gods, having driven away the Asuras by day and night, struck them with the three-fold thunderbolt.
1.212.2	These worlds are three-fold.
1.212.3	They struck them with these worlds.
1.212.4	Therefore they say, 'The Asuras did not follow them as long as these worlds did not come into existence.'
1.212.5	For these worlds are established by them.
1.212.6	This is the union of the Agniṣṭoma and the year, namely, the night.
1.212.7	The year is twenty-four half-months, the nights are twenty-four, the Utkhamadānas.
1.212.8	There are three pressings, three rounds.
1.212.9	They make the night three pressings.
1.212.10	Then they make her as if it were that day.
1.212.11	The gods, having conquered the day and night, brought back the sun with the libations.
1.212.12	They brought him back again with the seasons.
1.212.13	They established him in the fore-part with the Ashvina.
1.212.14	Therefore they say, "One should not praise the Ashvina before the sun has risen."
1.212.15	He indeed praises it.
1.212.16	He who knows this, his sacrifice is led by the Savanas. The sun has gone to the west and has returned again by the Parayis. It is raised in front by the Ashvina.
1.212.17	Both his day and night are touched and enclosed for his enjoyment. The sun moves through the signs.
1.213.1	Now this is the Rathantera junction.
1.213.2	Prajapati gave his daughter Ushas to Brihaspati.
1.213.3	He made her carry a thousand of the Ashvins.
1.213.4	He said to the gods, "This one is mine, the other is yours."
1.213.5	Therefore, when a man finds a wife who is not cruel, he gives her to carry.
1.213.6	Those gods said, "Let us worship this."
1.213.7	They did not divide it equally.
1.213.8	They said, "Let's race for it."
1.213.9	They raced for it.
1.213.10	Agni's chariot was the first, then that of Usha, then that of the Ashvins.
1.213.11	The Ashvins, the horse-owners, won the horse-race.
1.213.12	The gods said to them, "This is your turn, then let ours be with you."
1.213.13	Therefore they praise the deities separately and then the Asvins.
1.213.14	They praise Agni first, then the Dawn, then the Asvins,
1.213.15	for these are their respective praises.
1.213.16	One Sama, two metres.
1.213.17	It is two-footed, and it is placed on four-footed animals.
1.213.18	Therefore, from the two-footed, the four-footed animals are established.
1.213.19	One should place it before sunrise if one desires, "May he be worse."
1.213.20	He indeed becomes worse.
1.213.21	One should put it after sunrise if one desires "May he not be too far or too near."
1.213.22	It is not on this side nor on the other side.
1.213.23	The rain is indeed abundant.
1.213.24	One should place it on the rising sun, if one desires, "May he be better and obtain radiance."
1.213.25	He indeed becomes better and obtains radiance.
1.214.1	"You are the end of our feast," they become those having feasts.
1.214.2	The day is the end.
1.214.3	The night is the end.
1.214.4	The two days are indeed the beginning of the two days.
1.214.5	In them, Vaitehavya is the end of the Okas.
1.214.6	With Vaitehavya, the end of the Okas, the gods drove the Asuras away from the Okas.
1.214.7	He who knows this drives away his hateful enemy from the Okas, from the Okas itself.
1.214.8	The Okas are indeed the vital airs.
1.214.9	He thus takes away the life of his hated enemy and places it in himself.
1.214.10	They say, "Those who perform the Atiratra sacrifice are indeed moving away from this world."
1.214.11	The reason why there is the Ukthya sacrifice is that this world is the Uktha of man. They thus establish themselves in this world.
1.214.12	Vītahavya, Āśrāyas, Jyog, Aparuddha, wandering, he desired, "May I go to my own abode."
1.214.13	He saw this Sama.
1.214.14	He praised with it.
1.214.15	It attained the Nidhana as "Oka".
1.214.16	From there he went to his own abode.
1.214.17	This is the Sama that fulfills desires.
1.214.18	He desired this desire.
1.214.19	He obtained the desire from him.
1.214.20	He who praises with this Sama attains the desire he desires.
1.214.21	That is indeed prosperity and sovereignty.
1.214.22	He indeed attained sovereignty.
1.214.23	He who knows this attains prosperity and sovereignty. He goes to sovereignty.
1.214.24	Because Vītahavya saw the Ashrayas, therefore it is said, "Vaitahvya of Okani."
1.215.1	"Indra, the intoxicating drink" - they become intoxicating.
1.215.2	The juice is intoxicating.
1.215.3	The night is like a thought, like a pressed (thing).
1.215.4	They do not press (the Soma).
1.215.5	What is left over from the third pressing, they spread on it. With that they move around in it.
1.215.6	Now, when they are in the Madhuvatī metre, they put the juice into it, and thus they nourish it.
1.215.7	In them is the Śāktī metre.
1.215.8	By the Śāktā metre, Śāktā obtained cattle.
1.215.9	That is the Śākteya metre.
1.215.10	This is the Pāśvy metre.
1.215.11	He who knows this obtains cattle, becomes a great cattle-owner.
1.215.12-19	The Shakyas, desiring food, performed austerities. They saw this Sama. They praised it. Then they obtained food. This one has the same as the Gaurivit. Food is Gaurivit. Food is indeed the morning meal. Food indeed is all this.
1.215.20	This night is indeed extra.
1.215.21	They give extra food in the extra night.
1.215.22	It becomes Svara.
1.215.23	Svara is indeed the breath.
1.215.24	Food is indeed the breath,
1.215.25	This is the prosperity of food for the one who is ahead. The Sama is the prosperity of the one who is behind.
1.215.26	He who knows this obtains food and becomes the best among his kinsmen.
1.215.27	Because they saw it through the power of the Shaktas, therefore it is called Shaktya.
1.216.1	We have seen you for that purpose." This is the Kanva (Samhita).
1.216.2	Kanva, the son of Naras, was wandering without a fixed abode. He desired, "May I be established."
1.216.3	He saw this Sama.
1.216.4	He praised with it.
1.216.5	He attained the final verse, "Rantaya."
1.216.6	He who does not stand firm is as if not satisfied.
1.216.7	The night is like a woman.
1.216.8	This is indeed satisfaction.
1.216.9	From that he stood firm.
1.216.10	This is the Pratiṣṭhā Sāman.
1.216.11	He who knows this stands firm.
1.216.12	What Kanva, the son of Ṛṣa, saw, therefore it is called Kaṇva.
1.216.13	"The Soma pressed for Indra in the Madhu forest" - they are Madhu-related.
1.216.14	Madhu is indeed the juice.
1.216.15	This night is like a wound.
1.216.16	They do not press.
1.216.17	What is left over from the third pressing, they spread on it. They move on it.
1.216.18	Since these are intoxicating, they put juice on it. They nourish it with this.
1.217.1	In them is the Srotakaṣa.
1.217.2	Śrutakaṅkha, the son of Kāṅkīva, desiring cattle, practised austerities.
1.217.3	He saw this Sama.
1.217.4	He praised with it.
1.217.5	He approached this Iḍā.
1.217.6	Cattle is Iḍā. 
1.217.7	Then he obtained cattle.
1.217.8	This is the cattle-winning Sama.
1.217.9	One who knows this obtains cattle and becomes one with many cattle.
1.217.10	And that is the Puna:nitunna metre.
1.217.11	Wherever the gods found the essence of the metres, there they made it Puna:nitunna and struck it again.
1.217.12	This is as if the night were a mind.
1.217.13	And in that the metre is Puna:nituna, they put the essence into it, and it is the continuation of the essence.
1.217.14	The name of the river is derived from the fact that it was seen by Śrutakaṅkṣa, the son of Kāṅkṣīva.
1.217.15	It is a song of the Iḍā metre.
1.217.16	The Iḍā is cattle.
1.217.17	One thus finds support in cattle.
1.218.1	"This is your Soma, O Indra." This is a repetition.
1.218.2	This is your other sacrifice." Thus they said to Indra.
1.218.3	For the second oblation is made at night.
1.218.4	In them (the oblations) is the one who sits above.
1.218.5	For by the one who sits on high, the gods sat above in these worlds.
1.218.6	Whatever is above these worlds, that is the state of the one who is above.
1.218.7	This is the heavenly Sama.
1.218.8	One who knows this indeed attains the heavenly world.
1.218.9	The gods, by means of the upper abode, and by means of the Asuras' good hymns, won the cattle. By means of the "Nrimada" (hymn) they struck the thunderbolt. By means of "Bhareṣu" they ascended to heaven.
1.218.10	With the verse "By the upper abode, by the well-uttered verses, he binds his enemies, the foes, with the verse "For the cattle" he strikes the thunderbolt. With the verse "In the burdens" he ascends to heaven.
1.218.11	They say that they are not to be recited together.
1.218.12	"These worlds are indeed different. For the maintenance of these worlds."
1.218.13	The verse "With good words" refers to this world, "The world of men" refers to the intermediate world, and "In the burdens" refers to the world of heaven.
1.218.14	Therefore, by not approaching them separately, they are held together for the sake of these worlds.
1.219.1	Janashruti said, "This is the power of the Saman, that it is the final verse.
1.219.2	If one approaches them separately, one would weaken and separate it.
1.219.3	Having approached together, for the sake of the strength of the Sama Veda.
1.219.4	Those are four syllables.
1.219.5	In those four directions in this world, may we stand firm in all of them.
1.219.6	In those same four directions in the sky, may we stand firmly in all of them
1.219.7	In those same same four directions in that world, may we firmly stand in all of them.
1.219.8-15	The night is indeed the upper chamber. This (verse) is indeed the Rathantara. The space is the Vamadevya. The Brihat is the earth itself. Those who know this are the best of these worlds. One becomes one of them who knows this. Indeed, Prajapati is the upper chamber. He who knows this attains the state of Prajapati.
1.220.1	Come to us, O Indra, the powerful one. This is the Vena hymn.
1.220.2	Vena Vaishvamitra desired, "May I be the foremost, the chief, the most brilliant."
1.220.3	He saw this Sama.
1.220.4	He praised with it.
1.220.5	Then he became the foremost, the most brilliant, the most brilliant.
1.220.6	One who knows this becomes the foremost, the foremost, the brilliant.
1.220.7	The Vena of the son of Visvamitra saw this. Therefore it is called Vena.
1.220.8	They call it Apala.
1.220.9	Apala was the daughter of Atri. She was a sinner.
1.220.10	She desired, "May I destroy the sinful color."
1.220.11	She saw this Sama.
1.220.12	She praised with it.
1.220.13	She approached the sacred place and found the Soma-rays.
1.220.14	She ate them up.
1.220.15	Her teeth became like stones.
1.220.16	Indra ran away, saying, "The stones are speaking."
1.220.17	She spoke out.
1.220.18	The maiden came down to the water and found the Soma flowing. She said, "They are carrying it to the setting (sun). I am pressing it for Indra, I am pressing it only for you."
1.220.19	"This is her, indeed, who speaks like a stone-crusher." Knowing this, Indra turned away.
1.220.20	He said to him:
1.220.21	"This is the hero whom you are seeking. He is searching house by house. Drink this son of Jamba, the one with wealth, the one with mead, the one with cakes, the one with praise."
1.220.22	He did not accept it.
1.220.23	He said
1.220.24	"We will not treat you as a woman, nor will we treat you as a man."
1.220.25	"He turned back, saying, 'Before all the hymns, you are defeated.'"
1.220.26	"He poured the Soma from his mouth, saying, 'Slowly, slowly, O Indra, O Moon, flow around.'
1.220.27	He who, knowing this, smells the mouth of a woman, becomes like a drinker of Soma.
1.221.1	She said to him, "What do you want?"
1.221.2	She said,
1.221.3	"These three are the worlds. O Indra, you have raised them. The head is the best of them. Now put me in your belly. Make all of them hairy."
1.221.4	Khalați was her father.
1.221.5	He made Khalați.
1.221.6	Urura was his mother.
1.221.7	He was born.
1.221.8	The hairs of the body are in the anus.
1.221.9	They were born.
1.221.10	He threw them out of the sky on the chariot.
1.221.11	It became a snake.
1.221.12	He threw it out of the sky from the nose.
1.221.13	It became an iguana.
1.221.14	He threw that out of the sky at the yoke.
1.221.15	It became the Sanśliṣṭikā.
1.221.16	This is said about it:
1.221.17	In the sky of the chariot, in the sky of the yoke, O Indra, having purified three times, thou hast made the skin of the sun.
1.221.18	That is the best form of her.
1.221.19	This is the Sama that fulfills desires.
1.221.20	This one indeed desired that desire.
1.221.21	That desire of hers was fulfilled.
1.221.22	Whatever desire one may have, if one praises with this Sama, that desire is fulfilled.
1.221.23	Because Apalatreya saw it, it is known as Apalam.
1.222.1	"O bull, the pressed (Soma) approaches you." This is the Arshabha (Sama).
1.222.2	Indra desired, "May I be the bull of all beings, may I attain bullhood."
1.222.3	He saw this Sama.
1.222.4	Therefore, he is praised.
1.222.5	Then indeed that bull became the bull of all creatures.
1.222.6	That itself is the bullhood of the bull.
1.222.7	One who knows this becomes the bull of his own people and attains bullhood.
1.222.8	They indeed call him Daivodasa.
1.222.9	Divodasa, the son of Vadhryashvi, desired to obtain both Brahman and Kshatra. He thought, "May I be a king and a sage."
1.222.10	He saw this Sama Veda.
1.222.11	He praised with it.
1.222.12	Then he obtained both Brahman and Kshtra. Being a king, he became a sage.
1.222.13	He who knows this, becomes a king and a sage.
1.222.14	Because Divodasa Vaidhrashti saw this, he is called Divodasa.
1.223.1	This is the Garam hymn: "O Vasu, this Soma is pressed."
1.223.2	The gods and the Asuras were fighting.
1.223.3	Those who did not know (the truth) ate the food, thinking it to be food.
1.223.4	They thought that the food was poison.
1.223.5	They desired, 'We shall destroy these poisons that have been eaten.'
1.223.6	They saw this Sama (hymn).
1.223.7	They praised with it.
1.223.8	With it they destroyed these poisons that had been eaten.
1.223.9	Those very ones became these poisons.
1.223.10	Whatever he has vomited, he has vomited it back. That is the meaning of 'vomited'.
1.223.11	He who thinks he has vomited should recite this hymn after having eaten food belonging to one who has not accepted a gift, without having eaten food belonging one who has accepted a gift.
1.223.12	He indeed vomits back the vomit.
1.223.13	Whatever sin he has committed, he removes it.
1.223.14	This is the Iḍa hymn for the Acchāvāka.
1.223.15	The Iḍā is indeed the animals.
1.223.16	He indeed stands firm in the animals.
1.224.1	"This is indeed the strength of the Ojas." This is the end of the Ghrta-chuta.
1.224.2	The Ghrta-chu and Madhu-chu goddesses, wherever their sacrifice was offered, they nourished it.
1.224.3	Therefore, they say, "May you grow like the rays of the Soma."
1.224.4	This is as if it were a night.
1.224.5	And because the offering of ghee is the last, they thus nourish him with it.
1.224.6	The Angirasas and the Angirasas went to the heavenly world, but they were not satisfied.
1.224.7	They desired: "May we go to the heavenly world."
1.224.8	They performed austerities.
1.224.9	They saw these two Sāman chants.
1.224.10	They praised with them.
1.224.11	Having praised, they fell down to heaven, saying, "Ghee has fallen, honey has fallen."
1.224.12	Ghee is the end of all fluids, heaven is the end of worlds.
1.224.13	Honey is the end of tastes, heaven is the ends of worlds.
1.224.14	By means of the last two Sāmans, they attained the last heavenly world.
1.224.15	By means of the last Sāmans, he who knows this attains the last heavenly world,
1.224.16	The cows are indeed the ghee-dropper.
1.224.17	The cows are the honey-dropper. The cows are indeed the honey-droppers.
1.224.18	By means these two (Sāmans) they obtained the cows.
1.224.19	Having performed sacrifices with those animals, they went to the heavenly world.
1.224.20	These two Sāmanis are indeed connected with animals and the heavenly world. 
1.224.21	He who knows this obtains animals and goes to the heavenly world
1.225.1	These two Sāmānis are indeed the breasts of the sacrifice.
1.225.2	By means of these Indra milked the sacrifice and all desires.
1.225.3	He who knows thus milks the sacrifice and all his desires.
1.225.4	The other is the one with the Yajus as the final part.
1.225.5	The one with the ghee as the final part is the one with Yajus as its final part.
1.225.6	And the one with honey as the final part, that is the one with Saman as its final part
1.225.7	He attains the prosperity of the Yajus and the Saman. He attains the prosperity of those who know this.
1.225.8	They say, "They perform the day with ghee. But how is their night made to be full of ghee?"
1.225.9	One should say, "By the offering of ghee."
1.225.10	By this, indeed, the night becomes full of ghee.
1.225.11	Because the Angirasas saw both the offering of ghee and the offering of honey, therefore it is said thus.
1.226.1	Now about Medhatithi.
1.226.2	The Kaṇvas, having risen from the Sattra, went to Ayūñjana, knowing that they were the Udgatas. What did they do? They approached the sleeping Dhanvā, who was lying down in many places.
1.226.3	They desired, "Let us release these very animals, the beings."
1.226.4	Medhātithi Kaṇva saw this Sama.
1.226.5	He settled down with it.
1.226.6	Come, sit down here and sing to Indra, O friends, the bearers of praise, the most abundant of the many, the lord of wealth, Indra, with Soma, pressed with juice. He is our friend in the union (with Soma). He is our friend for wealth and for the morning.
1.226.7	Wealth indeed is cattle.
1.226.8	From there they let loose those cattle which had become (their own).
1.226.9	By the sound of "Hiṃ" they released them.
1.226.10	Those animals are called "Uruvarupṛṣṇaya" (those who are released at the end).
1.226.11	This is the release of animals, a Sama.
1.226.12	One who knows this obtains animals and becomes one with many animals.
1.226.13	Because Medhatithi Kaṇva saw it, it is known as "Medhatithi".
1.227.1	Then the Saumedha.
1.227.2	The gods, having slain the Asuras, thought themselves impure and unclean.
1.227.3	They desired: "May we be pure and clean."
1.227.4	They saw this Sama.
1.227.5	They praised with it.
1.227.6	Then they became pure and clean.
1.227.7	They said: "We have become very clean."
1.227.8	That is the Saumedha of the Saumedha.
1.227.9	He who knows this becomes pure and fit.
1.227.10	They indeed call it the 'first day'.
1.227.11	The first day, the son of Arcana, the younger brother of Shyavasva, desired: 'May I obtain animals and may I go to the world of animals.'
1.227.12	He saw this Sama.
1.227.13	He praised with it.
1.227.14	"If he goes to the sacrifice with a thousandfold strength."
1.227.15	He indeed won a thousand animals, he went to the full number of animals.
1.227.16	This is the animal-winning Sāman.
1.227.17	He who knows this wins animals, he goes to the full number.
1.227.18	The reason why the first day is called Pauṣṭika is that the god Pūṣan saw it.
1.227.19	The Uṣṇīṣa verses are recited on the Soma days.
1.227.20	The Uşṇīṣa is the city of the gods.
1.227.21	When they are recited at the end, they are thus removed at the end of the city of the god, for the protection of cattle and to prevent the Asuras from entering.
1.228.1	Among them, Kautsa.
1.228.2	Kutsa and Lush fought with Indra.
1.228.3	He came to Kutsa's sacrifice.
1.228.4	He bound him with a hundred old she-goats at the testicles.
1.228.5	Lush addressed him.
1.228.6-9	I have heard of thee, O Indra, the true, the strong, the bull, the prompter of gifts, the giver of wealth, the giver of food, the giver of light, the giver of strength, the giver of power, the giver of fame, the giver of heaven, the giver of bliss, the giver of happiness, the giver of joy, the giver of delight, the giver of pleasure, the giver of beauty, the giver of grace, the giver of good fortune, the giver of prosperity, the giver of success, the giver of victory, the giver of conquest, the giver of lordship, the giver of sovereignty, the giver of greatness, the giver of glory, the giver of renown, the giver of praise, the giver of truth, the giver of goodness, the giver of righteousness, the giver of virtue, the giver of piety, the giver of devotion, the giver of faith, the giver of love, the giver of affection, the giver of friendship, the giver of companionship, the giver of union, the giver of concord, the giver of peace, the giver of tranquillity, the giver of rest, the giver of freedom from fear, the giver of safety, the giver of protection, the giver of shelter, the giver of refuge, the giver of defence, the giver of security, the giver of immunity, the giver of escape, the giver of deliverance, the giver of release, the giver of liberation, the giver of the highest good, the giver of all good things, the giver of everything, the giver of every good thing, the giver of what is good, the giver, the giver of gifts, the one who gives, the giver of giving, the giver of generosity, the giver of charity, the giver of alms, the giver of offerings, the giver of sacrifices, the giver of oblations, the
1.228.10	He is the one who is Indra, the one who is Hova, the one who has been Hova.
1.228.11	He stood between them.
1.228.12	He said to them, "Bring your shares."
1.228.13	"I will drink with your own self, or with your power."
1.228.14	"So be it."
1.228.15	They brought their shares.
1.228.16	One of them took his own self, the other took his power.
1.228.17	Kutsa took his own self and Lush took his power.
1.228.18	Drinking with his own self the greatness of the other.
1.228.19	Drinking with his own self of the other, the greatness of the one.
1.228.20	Both of them are indeed his two selves, namely, the self and the greatness.
1.228.21	This is the Sāman with Indra.
1.228.22	The sacrifice becomes with Indra, with the gods. Indra does not turn away from his sacrifice, he does not depart from his sacrifice, whosoever knows thus.
1.228.23	What Kutsa saw, therefore it is called Kautsa.
1.228.24	It becomes the Iḍa of the Acchāvāka.
1.228.25	The Iḍa is cattle.
1.228.26	One indeed stands firm in cattle.
1.229.1	It is said that the Rathantara should be in the first verse, the Vamadevya in the second and the Brihat in the third, for the ascent of these worlds.
1.229.2	These worlds are these Sāmans.
1.229.3	This world is the Rathantara, the Vamadevi is the sky and the Brihat is yonder.
1.229.4	Therefore it should be done in this way for the ascent of those worlds.
1.229.5	The Rathantara, Vamadevya and Bṛhat are indeed the same as the Prāṇa, Vyāna and Udāna.
1.229.6	The Rathantara is indeed the Prāṇa; the Vamadevya is the Vyāna; the Bṛhat is the Udāna.
1.229.7	Therefore, one should do it in this way, for the continuity of the Prāṇa Vyāna and Udānas.
1.229.8	Now, if one desires that his offspring may be superior, one should perform the Rathantara in the first Trivṛt, the Vamadevīya in the other two.
1.229.9-14	Prajapati is indeed Vamadevya. They indeed attain Prajapati's own tone at the end for reproduction. One desiring prosperity and heaven should praise with Brihat. Prosperity is indeed the heavenly world. One who knows this attains prosperity, goes to the heavenly world. One who knows this does not abandon the world of his enemies.
1.229.15	This is like a share for the enemy, for the night is like that.
1.229.16	One who desires stability should praise with the Rathantara.
1.229.17	The Rathantara is stability.
1.229.18	One indeed becomes stable.
1.229.19	One who wishes for brahmic glory should praise with the Gāyatrī verses.
1.229.20	Brahma is the Gāyatrīs.
1.229.21	One indeed attains brahmic glory.
1.229.22	One who wants a man should praise with the Kakup verses.
1.229.23	The Kakup is a man.
1.229.24	He becomes one who has a man.
1.229.25	One who desires cattle should recite the Uṣṇīṣa.
1.229.26	Cattle are the Uṣṇiṣa.
1.229.27	He becomes the owner of cattle.
1.229.28	One who wants food should recite the Virāṭ.
1.229.29	Food is the Virāṭ
1.229.30	He becomes the eater of food.
1.229.31	One who seeks stability should recite the Anushtup.
1.229.32	Stability is the Anushtub
1.229.33	He indeed stands firm.
1.229.34	One who desires sacrifice should offer in the Pāṅkti verses, if he wishes that the sacrifice should come to him again.
1.229.35	The sacrifice is indeed the Pāṅktis.
1.229.36	The sacrifice comes to him again. 
1.229.37	One who desires strength and power should offer in the Tristubh verses.
1.229.38	Strength and power are indeed the Tristubh.
1.229.39	One becomes strong and powerful.
1.229.40	One who desires cattle should offer in the Jagatī verses.
1.229.41	Cattle are indeed the Jagatīs.
1.229.42	He indeed becomes one who possesses cattle.
1.229.43	They say: "In one metre alone, in one desire, is the praise (of the gods) for him who praises thus.
1.229.44	But for him who praises in the Brihatī (metre) it is praise in all metres, in all desires.
1.229.45	For all these metres converge on the Brihatī."
1.229.46	Gāyatrī and Jagatī are the two Brhatīs.
1.229.47	Uṣṇik and Tristub are the two Brhati.
1.229.48	Anuṣṭub and Paṅkti are the two Brhați.
1.229.49	Brhatī is indeed Brhatī.
1.229.50	Therefore, one should chant in Brhatī for the attainment of all these metres and all desires.
1.230.1	They say that the Trivrt stoma is the lightest of the stomas, the Rathantara the lightest of the Samans, and the Asvin the heaviest of the Sastras. But why should the Trivrt Stomas, the Rathantara Saman, and the Asvins Sastra be the lightest?
1.230.2	He should say: "The Trivrt is the breath."
1.230.3	Everything is established in the breath.
1.230.4	The Prāṇas support all this.
1.230.5	The Prāṇas are all this, and are all this.
1.230.6	These are the three worlds.
1.230.7	All this is established in these worlds.
1.230.8	These worlds support all this. 
1.230.9	These worlds are all this, are all this. 3.
1.230.10	Speech is the Rathantara.
1.230.11	All this rests on speech.
1.230.12	Speech supports all this.
1.230.13	Speech is everything here.
1.230.14	This is the Rathantara.
1.230.15	Everything here is established in this.
1.230.16	This supports everything here.
1.230.17	Everything here belongs to this.
1.230.18	Therefore, the Rathantara is the only one among the Stoma hymns, the Asvina is the only one of the Sastras, and the Trivrt is the only one that deserves to be supported.
1.231.1	They say, "Those who have Pavamāna (verses) are the other Yajna-krama (verses). By which one does their night become Pavamāna-like?"
1.231.2	One should say, "By the Rathantara (verse) which unites."
1.231.3	By this one, indeed, the night becomes Pavamāna- like.
1.231.4	They praise with that single verse which has been recited.
1.231.5	They chant the Trivṛt verse only once, for the Trivṛts are the final (verse). The going forth is the rising up, it is not the non-existence.
1.231.6	The first Trivṛt is the spreading of semen, the second is the generation.
1.231.7	The verses are the Self, the offspring, the cattle.
1.231.8	The Rathantara is the generation.
1.231.9	Just as semen is deposited but does not procreate, so it is when one praises with the single-verse.
1.231.10	When they praise with the three-verse, it is for procreation.
1.231.11	One who knows this becomes many and is born.
1.231.12	Now, indeed, of these (two), one has a place, the other has no place. If they were to praise with the (verses) recited once, then there would be two without a place.
1.231.13	In that they recite the Trikas (verses) in each Trika, thereby their entire night becomes endowed with a place and Pavamana.
1.231.14	As the day is, so is the night; as the night is, so is day.
1.231.15	The morning, midday, afternoon, early night, midnight, and late night.
1.231.16	That which is the triple verse, they chant the triple verse for the sake of maintaining the day and night.
1.232.1	They say that all the rites of sacrifice are completed with the twenty-one (verses). The hymns are twenty-one in number. The night comes (to an end). By what (verses) is the night completed?
1.232.2	He should say, 'The twenty-one (verse) and the three-fold (verses) are twenty-one, and the nine (verses) are also twenty-one.'
1.232.3	Then indeed did Bhāllabeya say, "Who will perform today the sacrifice with the rite of the two-fold light?"
1.232.4	Indeed this is the rite of the sacrifice with the two-fold-light, namely the Atiratra.
1.232.5	The Bahispavamāna is three-fold in front, the Rathantara is three-fold above, the junction.
1.232.6	Agni is the former three-fold, Aditya is the latter three-fold.
1.232.7	This world is luminous with Agni, that world with Aditya.
1.232.8	He who knows this, his sacrifice is performed with light from both sides, and he becomes luminous in this world and in the other world.
1.232.9	These two are indeed Brahman and Kshatra.
1.232.10	Brahman is indeed Trivrit, Kshatra is Panchdash.
1.232.11	This is the Brahman and the Kshatra, carrying the night.
1.232.12	This is the Brahman and Kshatra, having united, having removed all sin.
1.232.13	That these two Stomas are performed at the end, it is for the removal of sin.
1.232.14	He who knows this, removes sin.
1.232.15	When they attain the Gayatri, then indeed, the Gayatri is radiance and splendour; it is established in radiance and splendour.
1.232.16	And indeed, it establishes the sacrificer in life for the sake of all life.
1.232.17	For the Gayatri is indeed the breath.
1.232.18	He who knows this attains all life.
1.233.1	They say, one should perform the sacrifice with the Viraj-sambandhi.
1.233.2	Food is the Viraj.
1.233.3	Food is indeed the king Soma of the gods.
1.233.4	Having made it food, he offers Soma to the gods.
1.233.5	For indeed, he is not the food of the gods unless consecrated.
1.233.6	Having consecrated him, he offers him to the gods, having made him food.
1.233.7	Whatever he does for the gods here, the gods do for him.
1.233.8	They, being prosperous, prosper him with offspring, cattle, and food.
1.233.9	They say, "One should not perform the Viraj sacrifice."
1.233.10	For he who performs the Viraj sacrifice, the sacrificer remains again in this world.
1.233.11	He is rough, harsh, desiring to establish Viraj, desiring, not attaining, he remains.
1.233.12	Where will he attain that which, not having attained here, departs?
1.233.13	As if laughing at the harsh ones, Daivala Asita said, "Who are these sitting here?"
1.233.14	They said, "Those who have not sacrificed to Viraj."
1.233.15	He addressed them.
1.233.16	He falls from the chariot.
1.234.1	The wheel of the path is in front of the pit. That wheel turns towards him who performs the sacrifice with an incomplete (offering). What he gives away as a gift, that does not reach his world.
1.234.2	The wise ones, knowing this, said: "Those who do not know the sacrifice, they are indeed not divine." He said to them: "Those who transgress Viraj, they are indeed inferior."
1.234.3	They say, "From where did the sacrifice go? Where did it stand again?"
1.234.4	If he says, "From where it went," then he says, "It stood there again."
1.234.5	The sacrifice is indeed stretched out from the person and stands in the person.
1.234.6	Then indeed Hrisvashaya Alalakeya, the king of Mahavris, initiated his son.
1.234.7	Now Soma-Sushrut, the son of Satyayajna, was the Udgata.
1.234.8	The messengers of Maharshis approached him and said, "Come, this is a gathering."
1.234.9	While running towards them, he said, "O Udgata, I am giving you this son."
1.234.10	He then returned to his home.
1.234.11	He said, "O Udgātṛ, where did you place the sacrifice, where the sacrificer, and where his cattle?"
1.234.12	He did not reply.
1.234.13	He said, "Initiate my son again."
1.234.14	"We do not know where we have made your son."
1.234.15	They initiated him again.
1.234.16	He himself sang.
1.234.17	If he had replied, then the sacrificer would have been established in the sacrifice, the sacrificer in the Vamadevya and the Rathantara, his cattle in the Brhat.
1.235.1	This indeed is the highest limit of speech, when one says 'ten'.
1.235.2	This is the highest limit that speech has reached.
1.235.3	And when it is said, 'He has attained all that is the highest limit',
1.235.4	Now, what is above that, twenty, hundred, thousand, these are indeed the joints of it.
1.235.5	That is indeed the abundance of speech.
1.235.6	Here indeed one attains the entire Viraj.
1.235.7	Indeed this Viraj of ten syllables is the prosperity of man.
1.235.8	Ten are the vital airs in man.
1.235.9	This is indeed the praise of the nine hundred and ten Stotriya verses.
1.235.10	For this Agniṣṭoma is indeed composed of nine hundred and ten verses. The Stotriyas are the verses.
1.235.11	The eighty-hundred is done.
1.235.12	The ten is done, the ten is not done.
1.235.13	The Kurus say that this is the Dvāpara age, when the Stotriyas are nine hundred and ten, the lowest of the three ages.
1.235.14	The Krita age is victorious, the Tretā age is victorious, and the Dvāpara age is victorious.
1.235.15	There are two Stotriya verses, and two Upasthaniya verses.
1.235.16	The Kṛta Stoma is accomplished.
1.235.17	One conquers what one desires to conquer by the Kṛta.
1.235.18	One conqueres by the Kṛt.
1.235.19	And these two are the Paksas, namely the Pavamānas.
1.235.20	He makes them equal.
1.235.21	And the sacrifice becomes the Viśvajit.
1.235.22	Then he stands for two (verses).
1.235.23	Those two are the breasts of Viraj.
1.235.24	The Sacrificer with two feet, for stability.
1.236.1	Now indeed Kahhoda Kausiitakiya said: "Surely those who have the breasts of Viraja in the Stotriya (Sastra) have long breasts."
1.236.2	"Surely they milk this Viraj from the opposite side," he said.
1.236.3	The gods worship this very same prosperity.
1.236.4	The sages worship it.
1.236.5	We worship that very same supreme prosperity.
1.236.6	Of these nine hundred and ten stotriya verses, there are five thousand four hundred and seventy-two syllables.
1.236.7	Those very same two hundred and seventy-second syllables are the two breasts of Viraj.
1.236.8	He, the Sacrificer, is the two-footed one, for stability.
1.236.9	They say, "If the Stoma is of the Dvapara type, then by what is the Stoma made?"
1.236.10	One should say, "By syllables."
1.236.11	Or, "By hymns."
1.236.12	Or, "By hymns and praises."
1.236.13	Or, if one says, "What is made of ten," then it is indeed the Stoma made.
1.236.14	This is the tenth (verse).
1.237.1	Indeed, in the beginning this was a great mass of water.
1.237.2	It was the sovereignty of water, the kingdom of water, the food of water.
1.237.3	Agni thought, "This sovereignty, this kingdom, this food should be mine."
1.237.4	He saw this Agniṣṭoma-sāṃpada.
1.237.5	He led these waters upwards and downwards.
1.237.6	He, singing this very Stoma every day, made it the sole source of food.
1.237.7	He raised the upward waters by nine and twenty.
1.237.8	They went beyond heaven.
1.237.9	They stand there, having gone around, pouring in the seasons.
1.237.10	With twenty-one three-fold (sacrifices) he stood above these (worlds).
1.237.11	He spread them beyond the earth.
1.237.12	Those spread ones are enjoyed by one who follows them.
1.238.1	Some stand, some flow.
1.238.2	Having thus spread and removed these waters, he eats food in this world.
1.238.3	He eats food in this world, which is not small, medium or great.
1.238.4	Similarly, he who knows this, eats food in this worldly realm, which is not little, medium or great, after defeating and driving away his enemies.
1.238.5	All the gods approached him, who was conquering food.
1.238.6	They did not find it.
1.238.7	The twenty-first verse of the Yajñāyajñiya Sūkta, having placed it in the nine Bahispavamāna verses, he lies down, having become infinite, and encloses this food.
1.238.8	And as if embers were placed in a vessel, so he is seen in these worlds, infinite.
1.238.9	Those who did not find him, said, "Praise me."
1.239.1	The Vasus praised him with the Gāyatrī metre, the Gāyatrī Sāman, and the morning pressing.
1.239.2	He invited them to that very pressing.
1.239.3	The Rudras praised him with the Triṣṭubh metre, the Triṣṭuṣ Sāman, the midday pressing.
1.239.4	He invoked them to that very same pressing.
1.239.5	The Adityas praised him with the Jagati metre, the Jagat hymn, and the third pressing.
1.239.6	He invited them to that very pressing.
1.239.7	The Visve Devas praised him with the Anushtubh metre, the Yajnayajniya hymn, and the fourth pressing.
1.239.8	He invoked them to that very hymn.
1.239.9	Thus did these gods attain this sacrifice.
1.239.10	But those who did not attain it,
1.240.1	they were always defeated by the gods in food.
1.240.2	But those that attained it, they are the remaining ones now.
1.240.3	They alone will be the survivors.
1.240.4	This is the praise of all the gods.
1.240.5	For all the gods had the praise before.
1.240.6	Therefore, he who praises Agni with this (hymn) becomes Agni-stomer.
1.240.7	He praises Agni with this.
1.240.8	He praises with this, he praises with this (hymns).
1.240.9	He praises with it, he praises with it. He who knows this,
1.240.10	he attains the nine and twenty.
1.240.11	Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, the sun is the nineteenth.
1.240.12-16	One (verse) is left over. The sacrificer alone is left over, who knows thus. Just as light shines in the sky, so does he shine among the people, for whom he exists, who knows thus.
1.240.17	Whatever is threefold, all that comes together in Agni.
1.240.18	Whatever great and small things there are, all of them come together in one who knows this.
1.240.19	All desires come together in one, who knows this.
1.240.20	He is established in the yonder sun with twenty-one three-fold (rays), and in this one with nine twenty-one (rays).
1.240.21	They are thus established in each other.
1.240.22	He who knows thus stands firm.
1.241.1	He does not set, nor does this follow him.
1.241.2	He sets only in this one.
1.241.3	That is his setting.
1.241.4	For this one indeed goes to the setting.
1.241.5	This one indeed follows that one.
1.241.6	That is the state of being of the other.
1.241.7	For this one indeed follows that other one.
1.241.8	He who knows thus does not go to the setting nor does he follow.
1.241.9	These two are the deities of the setting.
1.241.10	One attains the state of being with them.
1.241.11	Then indeed these two deities, standing in these worlds, destroy all evil.
1.241.12	As long as this Agni shines in this world, so long does the sun shine in the other world.
1.241.13	As long, indeed, as one knows thus, the world is not perishable.
1.241.14	Just as this world is the abode of the waters, so the waters of the sky and of the earth desire this world.
1.241.15	They do not mix together, but they are united in the praise and the rite of this very hymn.
1.241.16	This very hymn unites them.
1.241.17	He who would be the protector of one kingdom, of two kingdoms, of three kingdoms, he would think that he is protecting the world.
1.241.18	The one who knows this is the protector of these worlds.
1.241.19	He who knows this becomes the protector of this world.
1.241.20	He is the protector of this worldly realm.
1.241.21	As long as there are Brahmins who know this, the waters and these worlds will not be destroyed.
1.242.1	Now, of that Agniṣṭoma, the morning pressing is completed in the Gāyatrī metre, the midday pressing in the Tristubh metre, and the third pressing in the Jagatī metre.
1.242.2	This is the self-completed morning pressing.
1.242.3	The entire (pressing) is in the Gāyatra metre.
1.242.4	Now, the four metres are in the midday pressing: Gāyatrī, Brhatī, Kakup, and Tristubh.
1.242.5-9	It has twenty-eight syllables. He places twenty syllables in the Gāyatrī. It becomes the Tristubh. And those eight which are left over, he places in the Brihatī. It becomes Tristubh. The Tristubh is Tristubh.
1.242.10	Then the six metres are the third pressing: Gāyatrī, Uṣṇīṣa, Kakubha, Anushtubh, Jagatī, and Bṛhatī.
1.242.11	Of that Gāyatrī consisting of twenty-four syllables, he places twenty syllables in Kakubha.
1.242.12	It becomes Jagatī.
1.242.13	And the four syllables that remain over, he places in Uṣṇīsa.
1.242.14	It becomes Anushtubh with thirty-two syllables.
1.242.15	Anushtubh is indeed Anushtubh.
1.242.16	She arranges it in two ways.
1.242.17	Of that, she places sixteen syllables in the Anushtubh of the Jagati.
1.242.18	It becomes Jagati.
1.242.19	The Jagati itself is beyond that.
1.242.20	Then those sixteen which are in excess, she places in the Brihat of the Yajnayajniya.
1.242.21	The Jagati has fifty-two syllables.
1.242.22	Four syllables exceed the Jagati.
1.242.23	Those are the four-footed animals.
1.242.24	And the four breasts of Viraj are the milking.
1.242.25	And the foundation itself.
1.242.26	As the four-footed one would stand, so.
1.242.27	It is here that it is exhausted.
1.242.28	Nothing exceeds.
1.242.29	He places three (bricks) less than the number of Vamadevya (bricks).
1.243.1	One (brick) is of the Yagyayajniya (Stoma).
1.243.2	The morning pressing is in the Gāyatrī metre, the midday pressing in the Tristubh metre, and the third pressing in the Jagatī metre.
1.243.3	For him who knows this, the light of the kingly power shines forth like the Brahman, the wealth and prosperity of the Vaishya.
1.243.4	The Gāyatrī verse by verse becomes the morning pressing, the Tristubh the midday pressing, and the Jagatī the third pressing.
1.243.5	There are seventy-one Stotriya verses in the morning pressing, sixty Tristubh verses in the midday pressing, twenty-four Jagatī verses in the third pressing, and one Kakup verse.
1.243.6	The Kakup verse is a man.
1.243.7	He, the Sacrificer, indeed, is established in this (earth).
1.243.8	He indeed, moves along here.
1.243.9	Nothing is left over.
1.243.10	Having taken four syllables from the twenty-eight-syllabled Kakubha for the one (Kakubha) and three for the deficient Vamadevya, he places one for the Yajnyayajniya.
1.243.11	Then he places the Gāyatrī that remains in the Stotriya verses of the morning pressing, in the one hundred and seven.
1.243.12	That indeed is endless.
1.243.13	He who knows this conquers endless prosperity.
1.244.1	His two pressings are completed with the Brihatī.
1.244.2	As it was before, so it is at the third pressing.
1.244.3	There are seventy-one Stotriya verses in the morning pressing.
1.244.4	They make up forty-six Brihatis.
1.244.5	The two Gāyatrī verses are two Brihatī verses.
1.244.6	They make forty-six Brihati verses.
1.244.7	Thus the morning pressing comes to an end with the Brihatī.
1.244.8	Because the morning pressing is indeed united with the Brihatī, therefore a Brāhmaṇa, even as he is born, is born in the world.
1.244.9	He makes it greater by the foot, or he makes it smaller.
1.244.10	Then these two, the Udgatṛ and the Hotṛ, unite the midday pressing.
1.244.11	The Udgatṛ unites the four metres.
1.244.12-16	And the Hotṛ recites them, and he brings three (verses) - the Anushtubh, the Paṅkti, and the Jagatī. The Gāyatrī and the Jagatīs, these are the two Brihatīs. The Uṣṇīṣa and the Tristubh, these are the Brihatīs. The Anushtubh and the Paṅkti are the two Brihati. The Brihatī is indeed the Brihatī.
1.244.17	Because these two (the Brahman and the Kshatriya) accomplish the midday pressing, therefore the world of the Kshatriya is to be attained by means of sacrifice and worship, by faith and by devotion to Brahman.
1.244.18	And because the third pressing is as it was before, therefore the world for the Vaishya is inferior to that of the Brahman and the Kshtriya.
1.244.19	For the world of the Vaishya does not attain to the world of the Brahman and Kshatriya.
1.245.1	The sacrificer is born into a limited world.
1.245.2	He conquers cattle with the first Stotriya verse of the first Trivrt, the earth with the second, and Agni with the third.
1.245.3	He conqures the atmosphere with the first Stotrīya verse of the second Trivrt, Vayu with the second, Prāṇa with the third.
1.245.4	The first verse of the third Stotra wins heaven, the second the sun, the third the stars.
1.245.5	There are nine Bahispavamānas, there are nine worlds of the gods.
1.245.6	One attains them by these (verses).
1.245.7	These three are the three Virajas, divine, sacrificial, human.
1.245.8	In them the well-minded Sailna met Janaka of Videha.
1.245.9	He said, "Let me know. Let the priests call me."
1.245.10	The priests of the Kurus and Panchalas came to him.
1.245.11	When they had arrived, Sailna was afraid, thinking, "The Brahmanas are coming, they will not let him go easily."
1.245.12	He said, "I have a word for the king."
1.245.13	These three are the Virājas, the three goddesses, the three desires, the three foods.
1.245.14	Among them, he who speaks from within, him you should choose as the Udgātṛ.
1.245.15	He indeed is the carrier of those desires, he who has desires in them.
1.245.16	He alone is the carrier beyond death, he who knows thus."
1.246.1	Then he indeed made them run.
1.246.2	He was about to go there.
1.246.3	He used to ask about the prosperity of these Virajas.
1.246.4	They did not succeed.
1.246.5	He who succeeded, he who succeeded in one, he succeeded in all.
1.246.6	I saw a brahmin who was examining these (Virajas) and said, "Run, O Shailana!"
1.246.7	That is the covering, as if it were a mountain.
1.246.8	These are the three Virajas, divine, sacrificial, and human.
1.246.9	This is the divine Viraja, namely, these worlds.
1.246.10	It is deficient.
1.246.11	It is only deficient for the sake of the sacrificer.
1.246.12	He places the sacrificer within it.
1.246.13	The moon is the covering of this one.
1.246.14	This is the food of the gods, namely the moon.
1.246.15	This is the sacrificial Viraj, namely the Bahispavamānya.
1.246.16	It is deficient.
1.246.17	It is so deficient for the sake of the sacrificer.
1.246.18	He places it within the sacrificer. This is the covering of it.
1.246.19	This is its covering.
1.246.20	For it is by the sound of "Hiṃ" that food is given to the gods at the end.
1.246.21	Now this human Viraj is these vital airs in the man.
1.246.22	She is deficient.
1.246.23	He himself is the Sacrificer, directly.
1.246.24	Her covering is food itself.
1.246.25	The navel is indeed these three Virajas.
1.246.26	One attains those desires which are in them.
1.246.27	But here it is found in them.
1.246.28	One is indeed freed from death.
1.246.29	In this world, one eats food for many men.
1.246.30	For this food is not for one man alone.
1.246.31	Whatever there is in this world that is related to the self, all that is held by Death.
1.246.32	That indeed is the year, that is indeed death.
1.246.33	Its seasons are indeed its faces.
1.246.34	For whatever dies, it dies in the seasons.
1.246.35	He who knows this does not die at an improper time.
1.246.36	One is born in the seasons with offspring and cattle, he who knows this.
1.247.1	These are the nine outer Pravargya rites.
1.247.2	These are six Brihatis.
1.247.3	The six are the six seasons, the six gates of death.
1.247.4	And indeed these are the six gates of Death. Only the Brihatī is capable of overcoming them, not any other metre.
1.247.5	He closes the gate of Death with the Brihatī metre, the gate of Death, the gate of the Brihatī.
1.247.6	Just as one who has gone beyond unevenness by means of evenness would look back, in the same way he looks back beyond this death.
1.247.7	They make this three-fold thunderbolt flow forth.
1.247.8	It follows these worlds day by day.
1.247.9	He said, "The city of Janashruti is not yet destroyed, as long as this three-fold thunderbolt-like sun continues to move through these worlds every day."
1.247.10	This fire burns upwards, this wind blows horizontally, and this sun shines downwards.
1.247.11	They look at one another without winking.
1.247.12	How can there be a conflict between the gods and the demons when they are like this?
1.247.13	He alone is his three-fold thunderbolt, following these worlds day by day, destroying all evil, and moving on, he who knows this.
1.248.1	They say, "One who is to be sacrificed to should sacrifice, or one who is to be a priest should be a priest. One who is to be offered to with the Catuṣṭoma should be offered to with all Stoma."
1.248.2	These are the Bahispavamānya verses.
1.248.3	They have twenty-seven syllables.
1.248.4	By that they do not reach the Trinava Stoma.
1.248.5	These are the Bahiṣpavamānya Stotras.
1.248.6	The Gāyatrī has twenty-four syllables.
1.248.7	That is the Trayastrimsa.
1.248.8	By that they do not transgress the Trayastrimsas.
1.248.9	He who performs the Catuṣṭoma sacrifices performs the Sarvas toma.
1.248.10	He who knows the lowest and the highest of the Stomas goes to the highest.
1.248.11	The Trivrt is indeed the lowest and the Trivrt is the highest of the Stomas.
1.248.12	He said, "O Varshna, I saw the Trivrit Stoma and the Trayastrimsa becoming one.
1.248.13	Therefore, I attained the supreme state."
1.248.14	One who knows this attains the supreme state.
1.248.15	Now indeed, Hararuni said, "What should he do who is practising witchcraft, or what should he do who has been practised upon by witchcraft? He who knows this three-fold thunderbolt, three-pronged, without a gap, without a crack, which follows these worlds day by day, knows that."
1.248.16	"He who hates him who knows this, is indeed practising witchcraft against himself. He who hates him who hates him who practices witchcraft against him, is indeed practising against himself."
1.248.17	This very one, the three-fold thunderbolt, with three edges, without a gap, without a break, following and striking these worlds day by day.
1.248.18	There is no loss of him, he becomes great.
1.249.1	Hopajiva Khaḍāyanin said, "I know this three-fold thunderbolt directly.
1.249.2	Therefore, he who hates me and whom I hate, both of them become dogs, and the dog is the worst sinner.
1.249.3	Agni is the thunderbolt of this world, Vayu of the atmosphere, and Aditya of heaven.
1.249.4	This is the inner meaning.
1.249.5	What is Agni is indeed speech.
1.249.6	What is Vayu is indeed the breath.
1.249.7	What is Aditya is indeed the eye.
1.249.8	Therefore, whatever one hates, whatever one breathes upon, whatever one looks at, I strike him with the thunderbolt.
1.249.9	There is no greater or lesser for him.
1.249.10	These very deities protect him who knows this, saying, 'He protects one who knows this.'
1.249.11	Then indeed did Śvetaketu Āruṇi say, "Just as the form of the white horse with black ears is brought here, so I know the form of this Stoma. It is seen as much by the eye, as much by the body."
1.249.12	Therefore those who want to see me in the morning also want to see me at noon.
1.249.13	I have never seen any other man like him, the one with good sight.
1.249.14	Śāṭyāyanī said, "What is the white horse? Is it one?"
1.249.15	Just as Agni's form, just as his radiance, just as Vayu's, just as the sun's, so is the form of this Stoma, so is its radiance.
1.249.16	Now, the creatures stand around it, looking at it.
1.249.17	Therefore, those who know and those who do not know, all stand around the Bahispavamāna, looking at it, without any leader.
1.249.18	And indeed, this is the fame of other deities.
1.249.19	This is the power, strength, sap, and energy of those deities, which is collected in the outer Pravargya rites.
1.249.20	He who knows this power, strength, juice, and energy of the deities, becomes powerful, strong, glorious, and radiant.
1.250.1	They say that the man who is about to be born from a woman desires a secret place. Other animals scatter among themselves. What is done in the sacrifice? Because of that, it is so.
1.250.2	He would say, "Because the Trivrt stoma is in the Bahispavamāna, having stepped forward as if towards the east, it falls on the Dhishnyas. The other priests are in the middle of the Dhishnyias. Therefore, it is so."
1.250.3	Because the Trivṛt stoma is dependent on the man, and the other animals are on the Dhishnjas.
1.250.4	They say, "That Trivṛt Stoma moves into the Gāyatrī. What does it generate from that?"
1.250.5	One should say, "The sacrifice with seven navels is the limit of the Iḍa."
1.250.6	That Gāyatrī bears the embryo.
1.250.7-8	She generates the Puronuvākyā, the Puronuvākya generates the Yajya, the Yajya generates the Vasat-call, the Vasat-calls generate the oblations, the oblations generate the Dakṣiṇās, the Dakṣiņās generate heaven.
1.250.9	The Stoma of three verses gives him to the Gāyatrī, the Gāyatrī gives him to the Puronuvākyā, the Puronuvākya gives him to the Yājyā, the Yājyä gives him to the Vasat-call, the Vasat- call gives him to the offerings, the offerings give him to the gifts, the gifts lead him to the heavenly world.
1.250.10	This is the sacrifice ending with the Idā, having seven centres.
1.250.11	His Stoma is indeed the Trivrit, the Gāyatrī is the navel, the Puronuvākyā is the navel, and the Yājyā is the navel. The Vasat-call is the navel, oblations are the navel, and gifts are the navel.
1.250.12	Indeed, this sacrifice bends towards him who knows thus.
1.251.1	The offerings of butter are fifteen in number.
1.251.2	The nights of the half-month which is filled with fifteen days are fifteen.
1.251.3-10	He obtains that very thing. Ten cubits are the fingers. Four are the arms. What is above the navel is the fifteenth. He adds that very thing here. The midday is the fifteenth. The nights of half a month are fifteen. He obtains that very thing.
1.251.11	The fingers are ten in number.
1.251.12	The four parts of the body below the navel are called Urusthīva.
1.251.13	What is below the navel is fifteen in number.
1.251.14	That is what is meant here.
1.251.15	The back is seventeen in number.
1.251.16	Twelve months.
1.251.17	Five seasons.
1.251.18	One attains that by that.
1.251.19	The fingers are ten in the length of a hand.
1.251.20	The seven vital airs are in the head.
1.251.21	That is the seventeenth.
1.251.22	That very one is here added.
1.251.23	The seventeenth is the Ārbhava.
1.251.24	Twelve months.
1.251.25	Five seasons.
1.251.26	He attains that very one in the eastern direction.
1.251.27	The fingers are ten-footed.
1.251.28	The four are the thighs, buttocks, and the two knees.
1.251.29	The three are the downward breaths.
1.251.30	That is the seventeenth. 
1.251.31	That very one here is added.
1.251.32	The Agniṣṭoma Sāman is the twenty-first.
1.251.33	There are twelve months.
1.251.34	There are five seasons.
1.251.35	There are three worlds.
1.251.36	The sun is the twenty-one.
1.251.37	One attains that by it.
1.251.38	There are ten fingers in a hand.
1.251.39	There are a ten-footed one.
1.251.40	The self is the twenty-second.
1.251.41	One attains it here.
1.252.1	He who knows thus, having united himself with the whole of this world, consisting of day and night, half-months, months, seasons and years, crosses that death which is in the heavenly world.
1.252.2	He who knows thus does not die again.
1.252.3	His bones become made of the Rig Veda, his flesh of the Sama Veda,
1.252.4	He who has removed sin, who has shaken off the body, and has passed beyond this death, shakes off the body.
1.252.5	Now these two, the divine and the human Viraj.
1.252.6	Of them, this Aditya is mounted on the divine one and shines.
1.252.7	There are four directions, four intermediate directions, and these two worlds.
1.252.8	This is the divine Viraj.
1.252.9	Now the human one.
1.252.10	The four eaters and the six beginning with the cow.
1.252.11	The eater is of four kinds: the Brahmin, the Kshatriya, the Vaishya, and the Shudra.
1.252.12	The cow, the horse, the goat, the sheep, the barley, and the wheat are the six beginning with cow.
1.252.13	This sun is mounted on these two and shines.
1.252.14	There is no grief, no cold, no hunger, no thirst, and no change for him.
1.252.15	He who knows this does not hunger, does not thirst, and has no change.
1.253.1	The Udgātṛ indeed pours the semen-like Yajamāna at the Bahiṣpavamāna.
1.253.2	The mind alone moves the semen, the breath, the eye, the ear, the speech, the Gayatri, the Tristubh, the Jagati, the Anushtubh.
1.253.3	He places himself in the Pankti.
1.253.4	And that which is the last Trivrt, that is the birth.
1.253.5	He generates it by that.
1.253.6	Because it is sung like the sound of a bell, therefore the foetus is born like the sound of the bell.
1.253.7	They say that the song is indeed without sound.
1.253.8	When the one who is being born becomes cruel, then she makes a sound.
1.253.9	And the great creation is born slowly, as it were, without sound.
1.253.10	Now, indeed, that is true which is the Gāyatrī.
1.253.11	One should entice the prosperity of that (Gāyatrī) by practising the Rāthantara colour.
1.253.12	Therefore, the song should be sung in a low voice.
1.253.13	Now, the Agniya ghee is dedicated to one deity.
1.253.14	That is indeed the praise.
1.253.15	Now, Indra-Agni is dedicated to two deities.
1.253.16	That is the establishment.
1.253.17	That indeed is the Pratiti and the Pratiṣṭhi.
1.253.18	He who knows this stands firm.
1.253.19	The Purusha is established in this world by the Trivrt and Pañcadaśa.
1.253.20	The one by which he takes is the Trivrt.
1.253.21	The one on which he stands firm is the Pañcadaśin.
1.253.22	Both of them are indeed Trivrt, both are Pañcadaśins.
1.253.23	The three-fold Stoma is indeed brilliance, the five-fold is strength and vigour.
1.253.24	He who knows this, having established himself in strength and vigour, takes away brilliance and splendour.
1.254.1	Now the Gāyatrī of the Madhyandina Pavamāna.
1.254.2	This is the downward-moving Prāṇa.
1.254.3	There are two Sāmans in it.
1.254.4	Therefore, he makes both (the two) with this (breath), ashes and wind.
1.254.5	The two are different in the beginning and different in the end, with the sound 'him' in between.
1.254.6	Therefore, one does not lament for the other, nor does the other lament for the other.
1.254.7	For this is what is enjoyed by them.
1.254.8	Now the Brihatī.
1.254.9	This very one is the breath that goes forward.
1.254.10	There are two Sāmans in it.
1.254.11	Therefore, he makes the two (things) with this (breath), he sprinkles semen and also urinates.
1.254.12	The two (things) are different in the beginning and different in the end, with the exception of the Hiṃkāra.
1.254.13	Therefore, one does not lament for the other, nor does the other lament for the other.
1.254.14	For this is the way it is enjoyed.
1.254.15	Now the Tristubh.
1.254.16	It is indeed the navel.
1.254.17	In it there is one Sama.
1.254.18	Therefore he makes it with one breath only, as he breathes in and out the breaths.
1.254.19	Now the back-bones.
1.254.20	The back-bones are strength and power.
1.254.21	Therefore of all those who have a back, of the bull, the horse, and the man, the back is the strongest.
1.254.22	For the back-bones are the strength and power.
1.254.23	They are in the Brihatī verses.
1.254.24	Therefore these (verses) are like the Brihatī, like the Parisaha, approaching the back.
1.254.25	Then of the Pavamāna of the Arbhava, the Gāyatrī.
1.254.26	This very one is that Prāṇa.
1.254.27	There are two Sāmans in it.
1.254.28	Therefore one does two things with Prāṇa: Prāṇāyāma.
1.254.29	The two are different in their respective statements and in their respective endings, and they are not uttered together.
1.254.30	Therefore one does not lament for the other, nor does the other lament for it.
1.254.31	This is how it is performed.
1.254.32	Then the Uṣṇīṣa and Kakubha.
1.254.33	Your eyes.
1.254.34	The same metre.
1.254.35	Two Sāman chants.
1.254.36	Therefore one sees with both eyes.
1.254.37	The two verses have three feet.
1.254.38	Therefore, the three-fold eye is white, black, and the pupil.
1.254.39	The verses of the supreme and supreme are obtained.
1.254.40	Therefore, the supreme and supreme person sees.
1.254.41	The two Prāstāra (verses) are different, and the Nidhana (verses) are also different, with the Hinkāra (verse) in between.
1.254.42	Therefore, there are different strengths in the eyes.
1.254.43	Then there is the Anushtubh (verse).
1.254.44	That is indeed speech.
1.254.45	In it, there are two Sāman (verses).
1.254.46	Therefore, the two are done by speech, one eats food and speaks.
1.254.47	The two are different in the beginning and end, with the Hinka in between.
1.254.48	Therefore, not all truth is spoken by speech, nor all falsehood.
1.254.49	This is how it was performed.
1.254.50	Then the Jagati.
1.254.51	That is indeed the ear.
1.254.52	There is one Sama in it.
1.254.53	Therefore, he makes it one ear only, by which he hears.
1.254.54	In the four-footed verse, it is said:
1.254.55	Therefore, being in one place, he hears all directions.
1.254.56	Even if he hears from behind, what is spoken by one who is behind.
1.254.57	Then the Yajñāyajñiya (verse).
1.254.58	That is the head.
1.254.59-63	The head is the highest of all the limbs. The Yajñāyajñiya Stotra is the highest of the other Stotras. He who knows this becomes the highest of his own. The head is the highest among all the limbs. The Yajñāyājñiya Stotra among the other Stotras.
1.254.64	He who knows this, is above all others.
1.254.65	This is the sacrifice, which is indeed manifest, and free from sin.
1.254.66	There is no one to censure him, nor is there any sin that he commits.
1.254.67	If he were to recite it in the Bahispavamāna, then one should say to him, "The seed of the sacrifice has been spilled, the sacrifice has been destroyed, your offspring will be without seed."
1.254.68	If he were to recite in the single-deity offering of clarified butter, then one should tell him, "The sacrifice has been destroyed by the sacrifice, you will die without offspring."
1.254.69	If he were to recite the two-deity formula in the clarified butter, one should say to him, "You have missed the foundation of the sacrifice. You will be a sacrificer without foundation."
1.254.70	If he were to recite it in the Gāyatrī metre of the Madhyandina Pavamāna, one should say to him, "You have destroyed the life-force of the sacrifice, the Yajamāna will be destroyed."
1.254.71	Or one should say, "The dripping (of Soma) will destroy you."
1.254.72	If he were to recite it in the Brihatī metre, one should say to him, "You have cut off the penis of the sacrifice, the sacrifice will be destroyed, the urine-retainer will kill you."
1.254.73	Or one should say, "You will be without semen."
1.254.74	If he were to recite it in the Tristubh metre, he should say, "You have destroyed the navel of the sacrifice, the sacrifice will turn back and strike you."
1.254.75	If he were to recite in the Prstha metres, he should say "You have destroyed Indra's strength in the sacrifice, the thunderbolt of the sacrifice will strike you."
1.254.76	Then he would say, "He who does not know will kill you."
1.255.1	If one recites the Ārbhava Pavamāna in the Gāyatrī metre, one would say, "You have deprived the life of the sacrifice, the sacrifice will deprive you of life."
1.255.2	Then he would say, “You will become short-lived.”
1.255.3	If one were to recite it in the Uṣṇīṣa and Kakubha metres, one should say to him, "You have lost the eyes of the sacrifice, you will be blind to the sacrifice."
1.255.4	If one were to recite in the Anushtubh metre, one should say, "You have strayed from the speech of the sacrifice, your speech will depart from the sacrifice."
1.255.5	Then he would say, "You will die of hunger."
1.255.6	If he were to recite it in the Jagati metre, he would say, "You will become deaf, you have lost the ear of the sacrifice, you will become deaf."
1.255.7	If he were to recite it in the Yajñāyajñiya (Sutra), one should say to him, "The head of the sacrifice has fallen, the head of the sacrifice will fall."
1.256.1	These are indeed the counter-recitations.
1.256.2	One who knows this does not encounter misfortune in the sacrifice.
1.256.3	He who accuses him encounters misfortune.
1.256.4	If someone accuses him, he should say, "I know this sacrifice completely, with all its limbs and all its parts."
1.256.5	"Whatever you do not know, I will cover up for you."
1.256.6	He who accuses a person who knows this will suffer.
1.256.7	This Prajapati Agni is the Agniṣṭoma. Having placed the Ekavimśa (Stoma) in the nine Bahispavamānī verses of the Yajñāyajñiya, he milks the five Pañcadaśas and the five Saptadaśas of the Viraj.
1.256.8	Those are the five Triṃśat stomas.
1.256.9	He who knows this milks the Viraj, all desires.
1.256.10	For one who knows thus, no sacrifice flows away.
1.256.11	For one who speaks untruth, the sacrifice flows away, and it becomes impure.
1.256.12	For one knowing thus, no sacrifice either flows away or becomes impure.
1.256.13	Therefore the Kurus and Pancalas did not milk the Dviṣṭnā cow.
1.256.14	It belonged to Prajapati.
1.256.15	Therefore others milked it.
1.256.16	For they did not know it.
1.256.17	Therefore, the other (deities) are more like eaters of food.
1.257.1	This Prajapati, Agniṣṭoma, having become circular, lies down, having become infinite.
1.257.2	In imitation of him, these other deities are circular: the circular sun, the circular moon, the circular sky, the circular atmosphere, this circular earth.
1.257.3	And whatever divine thing there is in man, that is round.
1.257.4	He who knows this, he who knows this, wins the great, endless glory of him who is attached to the limbs of this (Purusa).
1.257.5	This sacrifice is indeed attached to the Purusa alone.
1.257.6	Its feet are indeed the Bahispavamana.
1.257.7	These four are the Urvasthira offerings.
1.257.8	What is below the navel is the Trichandas of the Madhyandin (Sāman).
1.257.9	The Prsthya (Sāmans) are indeed Prsthya.
1.257.10	This is the Ārbhava (Sāman),
1.257.11	This is the Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
1.257.12	A Brāhmaṇa asked Nāgarīṇ Daulbhī, "What is the nature of the sacrifice?"
1.257.13	He said, "It is dependent on the upward-moving person."
1.257.14	Thus he said,
1.257.15	He who knows this sacrifice as being performed above the Self, goes up with progeny and cattle.
1.257.16	He who knows it as being performed below, attains prosperity below.
1.257.17	This is the Bahispavamāna.
1.257.18	These are the Ajyas.
1.257.19	This is Madhyandina.
1.257.20	The Prsthas are the Prsthas.
1.257.21	This is Arbhava.
1.257.22	The Pratiṣṭha is the Yajñāyajñiya.
1.257.23	One attains prosperity by it.
1.257.24	He who knows thus that these two sacrifices are being performed in him, he is honoured by the sacrifices.
1.258.1	This is the verse about him:
1.258.2	What was his former, that is his later; what was his later, that is his former. Like the movement of a snake, I do not know which is before, which is after.
1.258.3	Śakala Gaupaayana, while performing a sacrifice, went to the sacrifice.
1.258.4	He did not know which part of the sacrifice was earlier, which was later, which was smaller, and which was larger.
1.258.5	They say, "From where is the smallest part of the sacrifice?"
1.258.6	"From where is the largest part?"
1.258.7	"From what is the largest?"
1.258.8	"From the smallest."
1.258.9	The Bahispavamāna is the most inferior of the sacrifices.
1.258.10	This is what he said about the feet.
1.258.11	The feet are the most inferior of a man.
1.258.12	They are indeed the best.
1.258.13	For one goes by means of the feet.
1.258.14	From where are they the best?
1.258.15	From where are the most inferior?
1.258.16	The Yajayajniya is the most inferior among the sacrifices.
1.258.17	He said this about the head.
1.258.18	The head is the most important part of man.
1.258.19	It is the best.
1.258.20	For one sees with the eyes.
1.258.21	They say, "If the sacrifice is performed above, only the gods will live, not men."
1.258.22	"If it is performed below, only men will live, not the gods."
1.258.23	The sacrifice is performed both above and below.
1.258.24	Then indeed it is oblique.
1.258.25	If they were to ask, "Which way is the sacrifice?"
1.258.26	One should say, "Upward."
1.258.27	Or, "Downward."
1.258.28	Or "Oblique."
1.258.29	One should say "All directions."
1.258.30	For all directions indeed are known to him, and the sacrifice becomes so.
1.258.31	The Kurus and Pancalas debated about the Brahman.
1.258.32	They went to the dog lying covered.
1.258.33	They said, "Let there be victory in this very one."
1.258.34	The Pancalas asked the Kurus, "What is this like?"
1.258.35	They did not reply.
1.258.36	Vasishtha, the son of Chekitana, said: "Just as he (the sacrificer) lies down after having placed the Ekavimsa (verse) in the nine Bahispavamana verses of the Yagyaya-jya, so does this one lie down, having joined the two ends.
1.258.37	This one attains the form of the Yajnakrata (sacrificial rite) by this lying down.
1.258.38	Therefore, though it is not a hymn, it is called Vibhuti.
1.258.39	By that they won.
1.259.1	Indeed, the sacrificer is born twice: he is born from the pair and he is born from sacrifice.
1.259.2	What is born from the couple, that is born for this world.
1.259.3	And what is born from the sacrifice, that is born to the other world, is born to the world of Gandharvas, is born to world of gods, is born to heaven.
1.259.4	The sacrifice is the sacrificer.
1.259.5	The sacrifice is King Soma.
1.259.6	When they press King Soma with the stones in the Havirdhana, they make the sacrificer's semen.
1.259.7	This is Prajapati, the Udgata.
1.259.8	He is Tvashtra.
1.259.9	He is the one who makes the semen flow.
1.259.10	He is one who creates forms.
1.259.11	When he sings the Rk in the Bahispavamāna, he pours down the semen on the sacrificer who has become semen.
1.259.12	If he sings the Rg without the Saman, then he would be born as bone and not as flesh.
1.259.13	If he were to sing the Saman without the Rg, then he would only be born as flesh and not as bone.
1.259.14	He sings the Rg with the Saman.
1.259.15	Therefore, a man is born smeared with hair, skin, and flesh.
1.259.16	One should not sneeze on it.
1.259.17	If one sneezes, the semen would be cut off by the thunderbolt-like sneeze.
1.259.18	He who would even destroy it with hair would cut it off.
1.259.19	One should recite while singing it.
1.259.20	If he sings without reciting, the embryos would be without semen.
1.260.7	If one were to sing without reciting, the dead would be born as embryos.
1.260.8	The dead are born as embryos in the womb of one who sings badly.
1.260.9	One sings in the Tristubh meter.
1.260.10	The Tristubh is the eye.
1.260.11	It has two syllables that shine.
1.260.12	One places the eyes there.
1.260.13	Therefore the eyes are like a yoke.
1.260.14	One should sing reciting it.
1.260.15	If one who does not know the Veda sings, the blind and the unborn would be born.
1.260.16	The unborn and the blind are born to one who sings badly.
1.260.17	He sings the Jagati.
1.260.18	The Jagati is the ear.
1.260.19	It has four syllables that illuminate.
1.260.20	He places it in the ear.
1.260.21	There are two ears and two cavities.
1.260.22	Therefore, he hears all directions equally.
1.260.23	He also hears what is spoken from behind.
1.260.24	One should sing while reciting.
1.260.25	If one sings without reciting, the foetus would be born deaf.
1.260.26	The foetus of one who sings badly is born deaf.
1.260.27	One sings in the Anushtubh metre.
1.260.28	Speech is Anushtubh.
1.260.29	He sings it in the reverse direction, to prevent the speech from departing.
1.260.30	If he were to sing it in the forward direction, he would destroy the speech. The speech would depart from him.
1.260.31	When he sings it in the opposite direction, he establishes the speech in himself.
1.260.32	He sings the known and the unknown in the verse.
1.260.33	Those who know the meaning of words enjoy the words, and the meaning of words is what is to be enjoyed.
1.260.34	He who knows this enjoys the words and lives by them.
1.260.35	If he sings only the words that are known, then the people will speak and not remain silent.
1.260.36	But if he sings only the meanings that are unknown, then the people would remain silent and not speak.
1.260.37	Because he sings in the word that is defined and undefined, therefore people speak and are silent.
1.261.1	One should sing the powerful and audible Nihatam.
1.261.2	Indeed, the Anushtubh metre is like a slayer.
1.261.3	The gods, with speech as the Anushtubha metre, slew the Asuras who were without speech.
1.261.4	When he sings that powerful and loud-sounding song, he strikes down his enemy, who is indeed sin. He strikes down his enemy the sin, and attains prosperity for himself.
1.261.5	One should sing it after having learnt it.
1.261.6	If one sings it without having learnt it, the foetuses would be born without tongues.
1.261.7	The foetuses of one who sings badly are born without tongues.
1.261.8	He sings the Pankti.
1.261.9	The Pankti is the seasons.
1.261.10	He sings the Pankti which is spread out in the Gāyatrī.
1.261.11	Therefore, the embryos are born spreading out.
1.261.12	One should sing it after having studied it.
1.261.13	If one sings it without having studied it, the embryos would fall.
1.261.14	Indeed, the embryos of one who sings badly fall in the womb.
1.261.15	Now, that which is the last Triṣṭubh, that is the birth itself.
1.261.16	He generates it by that.
1.261.17	Mind is the semen, Prāṇa is the Gāyatrī, the eye is the Tristubh, the ear is the Jagatī, speech is the Anushtubh.
1.261.18	He who, knowing that mind is the semen, sings, is born with great mind and with mind from that.
1.261.19	Now he who, knowing that the breath is the Gāyatrī, sings it, attains the whole span of life.
1.261.20	Now he who is born from it attains the whole span.
1.261.21	Now he, knowing that the eye is the Tristubh, sings it, sees with the face of shamelessness, and is born from it as the seer, the visible one.
1.261.22	Now he who, knowing that the ear is the Jagati, sings it, becomes a listener, one who is worthy of being heard.
1.261.23	He who, knowing that speech is the Anushtubh, sings it, is born from it as a praise-singer, one who is master of speech.
1.262.1	The Sabheya (hymn).
1.262.2	Thus indeed did the Kurus and Pancalas know.
1.262.3	Therefore, among the Kurus and Panchalas, all heroes are born together with heroes.
1.262.4	But when they were not known in the past, therefore, among the Udanta people, all heroes were not born together with heroes in the past.
1.262.5	Now, since those who know thus go to the Udanta country and those who know thus perform sacrifices for them, therefore, after that, in the Udanta countries, Vīra was born with all the heroes.
1.262.6	The Kurus and Panchalas raised a question about the Brahman.
1.262.7	The Panchalas asked the Kurus, "What did we do at that sacrifice by which Vīra was reborn with all the heroes?"
1.262.8	They did not reply.
1.262.9	They won the prize by that.
1.262.10	If they had replied, "We are the ones who know thus and thus, and they have made us officiate, therefore a hero is born to us together with all heroes,"
1.262.11	then a hero would be born to them together with all heroes, if they knew thus.
1.262.12	They say, "The yoke is to be broken, the yoke is not to be broken."
1.262.13	They say that it is to be sung.
1.263.1	The Kurus.
1.263.2	The morning pressing is in the Gayatra metre, the midday pressing in the Trishtup metre, and the third pressing in the Jagati metre.
1.263.3	It is the Anushtup metre that follows them.
1.263.4	When there is the Gayatra metre in the morning pressing, he sings the Gayatra metre. The Gayatra metre is indeed Brahman, and the morning pressing is Brahman. He thus places Brahman in its own place.
1.263.5	Now when he sings the Tristubh, the Tristubh is the nobility; these are the arts of the nobility: the elephant, the gold-plated chariot, the chariot with horses, the chariot with mules, the gold, the bell-metal; having brought them, he anoints them in the Brahman.
1.263.6	Now when he sings the Jagati, the Jagati is the people. These are the crafts of the people: cattle, horses, elephants, gold, goats, sheep, barley, wheat, sesamum, peas, butter, milk, wealth, prosperity. Having brought them, he anoints them in the Brahman.
1.263.7	That is the Anushtubh, which is connected.
1.264.3	Because, indeed, when these are sung, then the Brahmanas are victorious.
1.264.4	But when they did not sing them, the Brahmanas were poor.
1.264.5	Satyayajna Paulastyya went to the one-covered, to the one-cart, to the one who was like a child, and said,
1.264.6	Now, from where these are sung, from there these arts are acquired by the Brahmanas.
1.264.7	He sings the Gayatri in front and the Gayatri above.
1.264.8	The Gayatri is indeed Brahman.
1.264.9	By means of Brahman, he thus encloses these arts on both sides.
1.264.10	Brahma himself has taken up these arts on both sides and they stand before him, for he who knows this.
1.264.11	The Pancalas say that they are not to be sung.
1.264.12	They are sung by themselves, as they are sung by the Dhurus.
1.264.13	One who sings them after the Sawan (sacrifice) ascends.
1.264.14	Then, when evil fame pursues them, they say, "They have gone away."
1.264.15	And those who stand in the country, dividing it.
1.265.1	The morning pressing is in the Gayatra metre, the midday pressing in the Trishtup metre, and the third pressing in the Jagati metre.
1.265.2	That is the Anushtubh metre.
1.265.3	When there is the Gāyatrī, he chants the Gāyatrīs at the morning pressing. The Gāyatrī is indeed Brahman. He thus shares with the Brahman-knower his own share.
1.265.4	He desires it and seeks to obtain it.
1.265.5	And that is his own.
1.265.6	For he shares with him his own share.
1.265.7	Now when he sings the Tristubh, the Tristubh is the nobility; he thus makes the Brāhman share in the nobility.
1.265.8	He desires it, he wishes to obtain it.
1.265.9	And that is his own.
1.265.10	For he shares in it.
1.265.11	Then when he chants the Jagati, the Jagati is the Vaishya. He thus shares his own with the Brahman.
1.265.12	He desires it and wishes to obtain it.
1.265.13	And that is his own.
1.265.14	For he shares his own with him.
1.265.15	That is the Anushtubh, which is connected.
1.265.16	Now when he sings the Anushtubh verse, the Anushtubha is the Shudra; he thus makes the Shudra share in his own (property).
1.265.17	He desires it, and wishes to obtain it.
1.265.18	But it is his own.
1.265.19	For he shares it with him.
1.265.20	If he does not desire it, or if he is not the owner, he does not obtain it.
1.265.21	Therefore one should not be angry.
1.265.22	For, indeed, when these are sung, then the Brahmanas are sung.
1.265.23	And when they were not sung, then the Brāhmanas were not sung.
1.266.1	The morning pressing is in the Gāyatrī metre, the midday pressing in the Tristubh metre, and the third pressing in the Jagatī metre.
1.266.2	The Anushtubh metre is connected with it.
1.266.3	When he sings the Gayatri verse at the morning pressing, he sings the entire Gayatri verse. He thus extracts the entire Brahman alone.
1.266.4	He thus extracts the entire Brahma alone.
1.266.5	When he sings the Tristubh verse at the midday pressing, he attains the Brahman with the Gayatri verse. Thus he shares the Brahman with the Brahman alone.
1.266.6	He gives it to him with faith, with the performance of rites.
1.266.7	When a Kṣatriya finds faith in a Brāhmaṇa, then he desires.
1.266.8	He gives it to him.
1.266.9	And when the third pressing is the Jātavedas, he attains it with the Gāyatrī verse. Then he shares with the Brāhmaṇa his own portion.
1.266.10	He gives it to him with faith, with the performance of rites.
1.266.11	When a Vaishya finds faith in a Brahmin, then he desires (to give).
1.266.12	He gives it to him.
1.266.13	That is the Anushtubh verse. It is connected.
1.266.14	And when he sings the Anushtubha verse, the Shudra is connected with the Anushtubhas. He thus shares his own with the Brahmin.
1.266.15	He gives it to him out of faith, with the performance of a rite.
1.266.16	When faith finds a Śūdra, then he desires a Brāhmaṇa.
1.266.17	He gives it to him.
1.266.18	He makes it his own alone.
1.266.19	If he becomes a Kṣatriya, he becomes a Vaiśya.
1.266.20	He goes to the Antasthā, and is not defeated by the Antasthās.
1.266.21	A hundred Pariskandhas stand up to him.
1.266.22	Then indeed, those who know thus, do not sing the Dhurva.
1.266.23	If he sings, then indeed, one who knows sings.
1.266.24	If he does not sing, then indeed, the one who knows does not sing.
1.266.25	That is the distress, if one knows only one of them. So says Satyayani.
1.267.1	He sings in the Retasya.
1.267.2	That is semen, he sprinkles.
1.267.3	That semen, deposited, is nourished by the Gayatri verse, by the younger verse.
1.267.4	That is nourished by the Tristubh verse, by the youngest verse.
1.267.5	That (semen) is nourished by the Jagati verse, by the same youngest verse.
1.267.6	In that it is nourished by the younger and younger verses, therefore the growing one has more and more strength.
1.267.7	It reaches the limit of the Anushtubh metre, with a smaller metre.
1.267.8	Therefore, in the later stages of life, it seems to grow more and more.
1.267.9	It reaches the limit on the fifth (day).
1.267.10	Therefore, in that fifth month, the foetus is transformed.
1.267.11	It reaches its limit with the Anushtubha speech.
1.267.12	Therefore, they listen to the speech of an old man.
1.267.13	The Bahispavamāna is the head of the sacrifice.
1.267.14	That is indeed so.
1.267.15	The entire body is indeed semen.
1.268.1	When he sings the Gāyatrī in the Bahispavamana, the Gāyatrī is indeed the breath. The head is indeed the Gāyatri. The breath is indeed the support. He places the breath in its own support.
1.268.2	He sings the Tristubh.
1.268.3	The Tristubh is indeed the eye.
1.268.4	Having taken that very (twig), he attaches it to the head.
1.268.5	Because he attaches it, the eye is as if attached.
1.268.6	He attaches it to the middle-part, though it is not in that part.
1.268.7	Because he puts it in a part other than the one it is in, therefore the eye departs even while the person is alive.
1.268.8	He sings the Jagati.
1.268.9	The Jagati is the ear.
1.268.10	Having taken that (thread) itself, he attaches it to the head.
1.268.11	Because he attaches it, the ear becomes like the attached one.
1.268.12	He attaches it to the third pressing, though it is not the place for it.
1.268.13	Because he places it in a place other than its own, the ear ceases to function even while the person is alive.
1.268.14	He sings the Anushtubh (verse).
1.268.15	Anushtubh is speech.
1.268.16	Having brought that (twig) itself, he attaches it to the head.
1.268.17	Because he attaches it, therefore speech is attached.
1.268.18	He attaches it to a place other than its own, to the place of the third pressing or to all places.
1.268.19	Because he places it in a place other than the one it belongs to, therefore speech departs even while the person is alive.
1.268.20	Other vital airs depart, not the vital air.
1.269.1	They say, what is that which is done in the sacrifice, from which the other breaths depart while the breath of life remains?
1.269.2	He should say, because he sings the Gayatri in his own place, therefore as long as he lives, the breath does not depart.
1.269.3	Then indeed there are the two, Dhura and Vijna, and Sanjna.
1.269.4	Mind is the semen.
1.269.5	Breath is the Gayatri.
1.269.6	The eye is the Tristubh.
1.269.7	The ear is the Jagati.
1.269.8	Speech is the Anushtubh.
1.269.9	With the mind one knows the good and the bad.
1.269.10	With the breath one knows the fragrant and the foul.
1.269.11	With the eye one knows the beautiful and the ugly.
1.269.12	With the ear one knows the audible and the inaudible.
1.269.13	With speech one knows the sweet and the bitter.
1.269.14	These are the known ones.
1.269.15	He who knows this becomes better.
1.269.16	They are indeed the names.
1.269.17	Mind is the semen.
1.269.18	Breath is the Gāyatrī.
1.269.19	Eye is the Tristubh.
1.269.20	Ear is the Jagatī.
1.269.21	Speech is the Anushtubh.
1.269.22	When the semen is being emitted, one should meditate on the mind of the one whom one desires.
1.270.1	One should meditate on the one's mind.
1.270.2	When the Gayatri is recited, one should meditate on the breath of the person one desires with one's own breath.
1.270.3	When the Tristubh is recited, one who desires should meditate on the eyes of the person one loves with one's eyes.
1.270.4	When the Jagati is recited, one whose desires should meditate on one's ears with the ears of the person one longs for.
1.270.5	When the Anushtubh is recited, the one who desires should contemplate one's speech with the speech of the person one wishes for.
1.270.6	These are the names.
1.270.7	One knows by that with which one desires, "May I know by this." One who knows thus.
1.270.8	Then he joins the divine and human yokes.
1.270.9	The human yoke is the mind.
1.270.10	The divine yoke is the waters.
1.270.11	When the semen is deposited, one should join the waters with the mind.
1.270.12	Then the sacrificer's mind would be obstructed.
1.270.13-19	The human wind is Prāṇa. The divine wind is Vāyu. When Gāyatrī is recited, one should connect Vāyu with Prāṇa. That would be the wind between the sacrificer and Prāṇa. The human wind is the eye. The divine winds are Āditya. When Tristubh is recited, one connects Āditya with the eye.
1.270.20	The sacrificer's eye should be directed towards that.
1.270.21	The human wind is the ear.
1.270.22	The divine wind is the directions.
1.270.23	When the Jagati is being chanted, one should join the directions with the ear.
1.270.24	One should direct the sacrificer's ear towards that.
1.270.25	Speech is the human wind.
1.270.26	Earth is the divine wind.
1.270.27	When the Anushtubh verse is recited, one should join the earth.
1.270.28	One should not let the sacrificer's speech be interrupted.
1.270.29	This indeed joins the divine and human worlds.
1.270.30	Having joined the divine and human realms, one crosses that death which is in the heavenly world.
1.270.31	One who knows this is not reborn.
1.270.32	He identifies himself with the deities.
1.271.1	Now, these great Brahmanas, namely, Aruṇa, Jīvalasa, Kāriradā, Asāḍa, Savaya, Indradhyumna, and Bhāllabeya,
1.271.2	Jīvalasa and Kāriradā and Indradhyumna and Bhālla-beya, these two went to the assembly of their preceptor Aruṇa.
1.271.3	They lived in the house of Āsāḍha.
1.271.4	He said to Āsāḍhya, "O Āruṇi, we have lived together in the life of a student, we have studied together, then by what do you surpass us?"
1.271.5	"What is this? You are dear to so much praise, so much sight, so much affection. By what do you attain this?"
1.271.6	He said, "I worship that which is in the sky."
1.271.7	He said, "What do you worship in the sky?"
1.271.8	He said, 'What is dear.'
1.271.9	He said, "What does one become who worships what is dear?"
1.271.10	He said, "He becomes dear to fame, dear to the eye, dear to the mind."
1.271.11	They said, "You are indeed so."
1.271.12	Then they said, "You are the best of the two, the one who is the best of the one who is in the middle and the one who is at the end. Even kings worship you from below. By what means did you attain this?"
1.271.13	He said, "I worship it from above."
1.271.14	"What do you worship from above?"
1.271.15	"Glory."
1.271.16	"He who worships their glory, what does he become?"
1.271.17	"He becomes the best in whichever part he is, and even kings worship him from below."
1.271.18	"You are just like that."
1.271.19	Then they said to him, "You are the village-priest of the Sharakaras, but by what means did you obtain this?"
1.271.20	He said, "I worship it in the sky."
1.271.21	They asked, "What do you worship in the sky?"
1.271.22	He said "The born."
1.271.23	They asked "What does one become who worships the born?"
1.271.24	Wherever he is born, he becomes the head of that village.
1.271.25	They said to him, "You are just like that."
1.271.26	Then they said to Indradyumna Bhāllaveya, "Your fame is spreading above and beyond others. You are indeed a speaker. How did you attain this?"
1.271.27	He said, "I attended to it with diligence."
1.271.28	What are you worshipping?
1.271.29	He said, "Glory."
1.271.30	"What does one become who worships glory?"
1.271.31	"His fame spreads above all others, and he becomes eloquent."
1.271.32	"So are you." They said.
1.271.33	They said, "If this had happened,
1.271.34	"We would have told you this."
1.272.1	They said to Haruni, "You are our teacher."
1.272.2	"You speak first."
1.272.3	He said, "I meditate on the Gayatri as dear."
1.272.4	The Gayatri is indeed the breath.
1.272.5	The breath is indeed dear.
1.272.6	There is nothing dearer than the breath.
1.272.7	He who worships this Gāyatrī as dear, becomes dear to the breath, as the breath is dear to the self; he becomes dear to fame, as fame is dear to the eye; he becomes dear as the sun is dear to the mind.
1.272.8	Then Jīvalakārirāḍi said, "I worship Śrī as the Tristubh."
1.272.9	The Tristubh is the nobility.
1.272.10	Nobility is Śrī.
1.272.11	He who worships this Triṣṭubh prosperity, in whatever half he is, he becomes the best. Even the kings worship him below.
1.272.12	Then Āṣāḍa Sāvayasa said, "I worship the Jagatī as the earth, the prosperity."
1.272.13	The earth is indeed the prosperity, the Jagatī is the prosperity of the metres.
1.272.14	He who worships this Jagati as the earth, attains the earth with progeny and cattle. Wherever he is born, he becomes the chief of the village.
1.272.15	Then Indradyumna Bhallāyana said, "I worship the Anushtubh as fame."
1.272.16	Anushtubh is speech.
1.272.17	Speech is indeed fame.
1.272.18	Speech goes above and above others.
1.272.19	He who worships this Anushtubh as fame, his speech becomes Anushtubh. Fame goes above and above all others. It becomes a statement.
1.273.1	They indeed became one by one.
1.273.2	Now he who knows all these in one way, indeed, all these become in one way. He becomes the best of his own people.
1.273.3	Vasishtha Chaikitaneya said: "The Brahmanas, while deliberating, have reached the conclusion that all these are in one way."
1.273.4	He said this to Retasyā.
1.273.5	That which they call the one yoke, that is Retasyā. The yoke is the yoke.
1.273.6	That is food.
1.273.7	The yoke is an ornament.
1.273.8	The fragrance is for Gāyatrī.
1.273.9	The visible is for Triṣṭubh.
1.273.10	The audible is for Jagatī.
1.273.11	When one speaks meritorious words, that is for Anushtubh.
1.273.12	He who makes them prosper with these (verses) indeed bestows food on them.
1.273.13	They make him the best among his kinsmen, the one who eats food.
1.273.14	He who knows this becomes the best among his kin, the one who gets food.
1.274.1	These three indeed are the oceans: Agni, Vayu and Asava Aditya.
1.274.2	One should sing them with these (verses).
1.274.3	When Prajapati bestows rain and food upon his creatures, they are covered.
1.274.4	This is Prajapati, namely the Udgata.
1.274.5	When he sings with the Pavamana hymns, he covers the sacrificer with food, he covers himself, he covers his creatures.
1.274.6	There is plenty of rain there, so says Kūṭa Śailna, where I sing.
1.274.7	Where there is plenty of rain, there the bull, the horse, the elephant, the gold coin, the man are auspicious.
1.274.8	Each form is auspicious there. This is what the knower said.
1.274.9	He who separates the gods and men, he goes away from sin.
1.274.10	The gods are the Pavamana hymns.
1.274.11	The offspring are the Prstha hymns.
1.274.12	One should sing the Pavamana verses in a hidden, indirect, and undefined manner.
1.274.13	For the gods are hidden, indirect, undefined.
1.274.14	The offspring is the Prstha.
1.274.15	By means of those (verses) which are covered and which are directly stated, one should chant.
1.274.16	For, as it were, the men are covered and as it were, directly stated.
1.274.17	This indeed separates the gods from the men. He who knows this, is separated from sin.
1.275.1	He who chants with Pavamāna verses, indeed approaches the assembly of the divine.
1.275.2	He should sing as if he were approaching the better, as if he were bowing down, as if he had attained, as if he could strike, as if he was being struck.
1.275.3	As if he were approaching, as if he knew what was to be done, as if he would give what was asked for, so should he do.
1.275.4	Now if one who is not successful with these (verses) and is not injured, should sing (the verses) without them, then he should give as much as he has promised, but not more.
1.275.5	Herein indeed is known the success and failure of the sacrifice.
1.275.6	The Pavamana verses are indeed a great wonder.
1.275.7	He who crosses a river without a garment, is smeared with mud and does not cross.
1.275.8	But he who crosses with a garment, is not smeared with mud and crosses.
1.275.9	Thus are the Pavamāna hymns performed.
1.275.10	They say, "Why are the other hymns performed with the Stotriya-verses, but the Pavamāna-hymns are not performed with the Stotrīya-verses?"
1.275.11	He would say, "The Prāṇas are the Pavamānas."
1.275.12	The Prāṇās are the Pavamānīyas.
1.275.13	If they were to conclude with the Pavamāņas and Pavamānīya verses, they would be turning away from the Prāṇas and would be wiping them out.
1.275.14	When they conclude with the Anushtubh verses, Anushtubh is speech, and the Apāna is controlled by speech, so they have controlled the Apāna by speech.
1.276.1	They say that the Stotra is not properly concluded if it is not concluded with the Stotriya.
1.276.2	By what is the Stotriya concluded?
1.276.3	He should say: The Anushtubh is speech.
1.276.4	All the metres are in speech.
1.276.5	The Pavamāna Stotras are the Agniya and the Indraya. By them the Stotriya and Pratipada Stotras are made to be in the same order.
1.276.6	The Pavamāna Stomas are indeed called the Jaya Stomas.
1.276.7	By the Pavamāna Stotra the gods conquered the Asuras and went away.
1.276.8	The Pavamanas are indeed the ones that go away. One should go away conquering like this. That is the way.
1.276.9	When they recite the Anushtubh verses, speech is Anushtubh. Speech is the one who speaks. Speech says, "Go forward, conquer, do not retreat."
1.276.10	Just as one would say with speech, "Go forward..."
1.276.11	The Pavamana verses are indeed the gods.
1.276.12	Those are the hymns of the gods.
1.276.13	The gods are connected with those.
1.276.14-18	The Prajas (beings) are the Prstha Stotras. They are the Stotras of the Prajas. They are connected with the Prajas. When he praises with the Pavamana Stotras, it is because he praises with the Stotras that are beyond (the Prajas). Therefore the gods are beyond. The sun moves beyond, the moon beyond, the stars beyond, Agni burning moves beyond.
1.276.19	Now because he praises with the Parāchī and Arvāchī Ukthas, therefore the progeny is both Parāchī (going away) and Arvāchí (coming back).
1.276.20	The Parāchī go forth in the morning and return in the evening.
1.276.21	The semen is deposited in the Parāchí (direction) and is born in the Arvāchí.
1.277.1	Pṛthu Vainya asked the heavenly Vrātyas:
1.277.2	The supreme abode of sacrifice, fashioned in the secret place, from the great firmament, why do the Pavamānas go away? Why do the Ukthyas return? It thunders.
1.277.3	The gods use one path of the sacrifice, men use another. Therefore the Pavamāna hymns go away from here, and the Uktha hymns return. So they say.
1.277.4	He who knows that the gods are connected with men and men are connected with the gods, he becomes connected with the gods and connected with men.
1.277.5	He goes to that world where the gods are.
1.277.6	The gods do not depart from here.
1.277.7	The gods are the Pavamana hymns.
1.277.8	The offspring are the Prstha hymns.
1.277.9	The gods indeed are the Sama hymns.
1.277.10	The Sama hymns are the offspring.
1.277.11	Now, when the Pavamana Sama hymns are sung in the reverse order, then this verse is sung in the reverse direction. Thus the gods are united with men.
1.277.12	Now, when the Rk is being recited in the Abhyavarti (Sutra), if one recites the Sama, then by that the men are united with the gods.
1.277.13	He who knows this thus, becomes united with the gods, united with men.
1.277.14	He goes to that world where the gods are.
1.277.15	The deities do not depart from him.
1.278.1	He who turns away from the divine and human forms, turns away from sin.
1.278.2	The Pavamana hymns are indeed the gods.
1.278.3	The Praja (hymns) are the Prstha (hymns).
1.278.4	In that he praises the Pavamana hymns in the Pavamana (hymns), therefore the gods are of one form, all white.
1.278.5	Now, because he praises with the Pañcadaśa Stotras, which have various forms and are dedicated to various deities, therefore, his progeny has various forms, white, red, and black.
1.278.6	This indeed is the form of the gods and the form of humans. He who knows this turns away from sin.
1.278.7	He who knows the Uddhara of the gods takes the Uddhara and becomes Uddharya.
1.278.8	The Bahispavamāna is indeed the release of the gods.
1.278.9	They praise with it once performed.
1.278.10	Therefore the release is beyond.
1.278.11	This indeed is the best of the gods. His release is
1.278.12	The release of him who knows this.
1.278.13	He who knows this takes the release of Prajapati, he becomes released.
1.278.14	Having thus taken out the essence of the sacrifice, he gives it to Prajapati before others. Therefore, while chanting the Bahispavamāna hymn, they move like serpents, angry and fierce.
1.278.15	This is the way to approach the better.
1.278.16	Therefore, one should not speak during that hymn.
1.278.17	For who is worthy of advising someone on how to approach the better?
1.278.18	He who gives advice for the welfare (of the sacrificer) leads him to that state of distress for which he desires.
1.278.19	Then when the Adhvaryu gives the instructions, he gives the essence of the sacrifice to Prajapati and nourishes it.
1.278.20	By this nourishing and essence-giving, the praise becomes praised.
1.279.1	He who knows the divine and human fame, he alone goes to fame among the gods and fame among men.
1.279.2	The Pavamana indeed is the divine fame.
1.279.3	They are indeed the vital airs.
1.279.4	They indeed present him to the gods.
1.279.5	The Abhivartas are the human fame.
1.279.6	They indeed are the out-breaths.
1.279.7	They indeed make him known to men.
1.279.8	This is indeed the divine fame and human fame.
1.279.9	He who knows this divine fame and human one, goes to fame among the gods and fame among humans.
1.279.10	He who understands the limited and unlimited, becomes very limited and unlimited.
1.279.11	The Pavamana hymns are the gods.
1.279.12	The Prastara hymns are the offspring.
1.279.13	The Sama hymns are the gods.
1.279.14	The subjects are the weapons.
1.279.15	That is this.
1.279.16	These very ones are all the gods, namely the hymns.
1.279.17	Because the hymns are measured, therefore the gods are measured.
1.279.18	Eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas.
1.279.19	And because the weapons are immeasurable, therefore the subjects are immeasurable.
1.279.20	We do not know how many Brahmanas, how many Rajanyas, how many Vaishyas, how many Shudras there are.
1.279.21	This is the limited and unlimited.
1.279.22	He who knows this becomes limited and unlimited and has much.
1.279.23	Those who are below say that he is above, and those who are above say that he is below. Indra and Soma have done this. The yoked reins of the chariot are carrying him along.
1.279.24	The Pavamana verses are the ones that are above.
1.279.25	Their cups are the ones that belong to the ones below.
1.279.26	They are indeed the vital airs.
1.279.27	Therefore one is able to breathe in and out.
1.279.28	The ones that are below are the ones that turn back.
1.280.3	Now, whatever other kind of chant is done there, it is called Gāyatrī.
1.280.4	Triṣṭubh is the most important in the Madhyandina Sāman.
1.280.5	Whatever other kind of chant may be done there, it becomes known as Triṣṭubh.
1.280.6	Jagatī is the most important at the third pressing.
1.280.7	And whatever other kind of chant is done there, it is called the Jāgata.
1.280.8	This is the seniority of the Savanas.
1.280.9	He who knows this seniority of the Savana goes to seniority, he does not fall from seniority.
1.280.10	He who understands the houses of the gods becomes a householder, he obtains houses.
1.280.11	The metres are the houses of the gods.
1.280.12	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
1.280.13	The Vasus are eight.
1.280.14	The Vasu-s are the house-holders of the Gayatri.
1.280.15	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
1.280.16	The Rudras are eleven.
1.280.17	The Rudra-s are the householders of the Tristubh.
1.280.18	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
1.280.19	The Adityas are twelve.
1.280.20	The Adit-ya-s are the householder of the Jagati.
1.280.21	The All-gods are indeed in the Anushtubh metre.
1.280.22	Indra and Agni are in the Savanas.
1.280.23	He who knows thus the houses of the gods becomes a householder and obtains houses.
1.280.24	He who indeed knows the satisfaction of the gods is satisfied by himself, his offspring is satisfied.
1.281.1	Now indeed, the Soma-drinking Somasamāpi said: "One should sacrifice to him, or he should sacrifice to another, just as one would satisfy cows that are not obstructed in a great sacred place. Thus all the deities are satisfied with the Anusavana. One should know that the syllables of the Chanda are satisfied without obstruction."
1.281.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
1.281.3	The Vasus are eight.
1.281.4	The Gayatri of the Vasus is the morning pressing.
1.281.5	The syllables of that pressing, one after another, satisfy them without obstruction.
1.281.6	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
1.281.7	The Rudras are eleven.
1.281.8	The Tristup of the Rudras is the midday pressing.
1.281.9	The metres, in the midday pressing, are satisfied with each syllable, without obstruction.
1.281.10	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
1.281.11	There are twelve Adityas.
1.281.12	The Adityas' pressing is the third pressing.
1.281.13	The metres, in the third pressing, are satisfied, without obstruction, with each syllable.
1.281.14	He who knows thus, these satisfactions of the gods, is satisfied by himself, his progeny is satisfied.
1.282.1	Wherever he who knows thus offers or causes to be offered, the gods do not have control over him, if they do not come there.
1.282.2	If they are going to eat or not, they go.
1.282.3	If he is pure, they eat.
1.282.4	If one is impure, they look at him.
1.282.5	That is also a wager, for whom they look at.
1.282.6	He who knows the vessel of the gods becomes the vessel of his own people.
1.282.7	Indeed, the Brahman is the vessel of the Gods.
1.282.8	One becomes the vessel of one's own people if one knows this.
1.282.9	Just as those who are thirsty desire a pure and clean vessel, so do the gods desire a pure and learned brahmin.
1.282.10	Therefore, one should strive to be pure and learned.
1.283.1	Prajapati created the gods.
1.283.2	Death, the evil one, was created among them.
1.283.3	Those gods approached Prajapati and said, "Why did you not release us? If you had released us from sin, we would have been free from sin."
1.283.4	He said, "Gather the metres."
1.283.5	They entered them according to their respective places.
1.283.6	Then you will be turned away from death and sin."
1.283.7	The Vasus gathered the Gayatri metre.
1.283.8	They entered her.
1.283.9	She covered them.
1.283.10	The Rudras brought forth the Tristubh.
1.283.11	They entered her.
1.283.12	SHe covered them.
1.283.13	 The Adityas brought forth the Jagati.
1.283.14	They entered it.
1.283.15	She covered it.
1.283.16	The Visve Devas brought forth the Anushtubh.
1.283.17	They went into it.
1.283.18	She enveloped them.
1.283.19	The Maruts filled the Pankti.
1.283.20	They entered it.
1.283.21	It covered them.
1.283.22	The Sadhyas and Aptyas filled the Atichandas.
1.283.23	They entered that.
1.283.24	It covered those.
1.284.1	Indra and Agni entered the Savanas.
1.284.2	Then indeed Death, sin, did not know them.
1.284.3	Where is death for him, for whom he does not know?
1.284.4	Death, the evil one, does not find him who knows this.
1.284.5	The metres indeed covered him from the evil of death.
1.284.6	And in that the metres covered him from the evils of death, therefore the metres are called metres.
1.284.7	The metres indeed cover him from sin and death, he who knows thus.
1.284.8	He who knows thus, whatever rite he performs with the metres, he then becomes that.
1.284.9	He who reproaches him while he is performing with the metres, from that he is excluded.
1.284.10	He who knows this has no affliction at all.
1.284.11	He who accuses him suffers affliction.
1.284.12	Then Hotr Urja Janayana asked Kapivana Bhauvayana, "What is the Anushtubh metre that flows into the Savanas, the Gayatri at the morning Savana, the Trishtup at the midday Savana, and the Jagati at the third Savana? What is this Anushtubh that flows into the mouths of the Savanas and carries the sacrifice to the end?"
1.284.13	He said, "The Anushtubh is indeed speech."
1.284.14	The sacrifice is stretched out in speech.
1.284.15	Just as a good bull, when repeatedly driven back by a rope, runs back again and again, or just as one is driven back by a heavy load, so do they yoke this speech, the Anushtubh, at the openings of the pressing-sheds for the purpose of carrying.
1.284.16	The openings of the pressing sheds are indeed like a heavy load.
1.284.17	This speech, indeed, carries the sacrifice from the end.
1.284.18	He who knows this Anushtubh in all places, to him good fortune is attained everywhere.
1.284.19	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
1.284.20	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
1.284.21	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
1.284.22	"Vāg" is the concluding verse of the Yajñāyajñiya.
1.284.23	That is thirty-two.
1.284.24	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
1.284.25	Or, this is for the morning pressing, for the midday pressing, for the third pressing.
1.284.26	Or, this is for Brahman, for Kshatra, for Vis.
1.284.27	Or, it is for this world, for the atmosphere, for the other world.
1.284.28	He who knows this Anushtubh in all places, has merit in all places.
1.285.1	Then Haahina and Asvatthi, Keśī and Dārbhya, Keśī, the son of Sātākirti, obstructed the Purohita.
1.285.2	He was older than Haahina and younger than Keśī.
1.285.3	He said to him, "O Keśī, what did you bring for me, O wise one?"
1.285.4	He said, "We worship all the metres as the Anushtubh, the Brihatī, the animals, the sacrifice, and the heavenly world."
1.285.5	He knew that he was a brahmin.
1.285.6	He felt compassion.
1.285.7	He said to him, "Do not feel compassion.
1.285.8	If you feel compassion for a brahmin, this is your brahmin.
1.285.9	We will seek another brahmin."
1.285.10	He said, "O Kesin, this is not the desire of a king.
1.285.11	He knew it by remembering the life of a brahmin.
1.285.12	He lived the life of a brahman.
1.285.13	He heard from Uparajasa that this young boy had said so much.
1.285.14	He knew this by remembering it.
1.285.15	He said that the Anushtubh is all the metres.
1.285.16	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
1.285.17	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
1.285.18	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
1.285.19	"The Yajnayajniya ends with the word "speech."
1.285.20	That is thirty-two.
1.285.21	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
1.285.22	He said that the Anustubh is all the meters.
1.285.23	The Brihatī is the animals.
1.285.24	The Anushtubh is the Brihatī.
1.285.25	It became the Brihatī in the animals which have four feet.
1.285.26	The sacrifice.
1.285.27	For he who has animals approaches the sacrifice.
1.285.28	The heavenly world.
1.285.29	For the heavenly world is indeed the Brihatī.
1.285.30	Then Sangmana Kshami asked Satyayajna Paulasty, "O Satyayajna, the Gāyatrī is praised by the teacher Āruṇi. The Tristubh is praised. The Jagatī is not praised. How do they all become complete? How do they ascend to the midday pressing?"
1.285.31	He did not reply to that.
1.285.32	He was defeated by him.
1.285.33	If he had replied, then the Brahman and the Vaishya would have worshipped the Kshatriya from below. And because they became the first two, and because this is the twelve-syllabled verse.
1.286.1	When the Vedas divided these worlds, the Gayatri got this world, the Tristubh the Antarikṣa, and the Jagati the heaven.
1.286.2	The Gayatri is indeed Brahman.
1.286.3	The Kṣatra is the Tristubh.
1.286.4	The Vid is the Jagati.
1.286.5	This Tristubh was placed in this atmosphere by means of the Nala and Upadana, by means of the Araranya.
1.286.6	He pierced this Gayatri from the east.
1.286.7	He heated it.
1.286.8	It was afraid, thinking, "He will take away my abode."
1.286.9	It said to him, "Let there be salutations to you. What desire do you have by piercing me?"
1.286.10	He said, "Give me a gift."
1.286.11	She gave him two verses of eight syllables.
1.286.12	The Sama and the Jagati were given to Upamanyava.
1.286.13	He pierced it.
1.286.14	He heated it.
1.286.15	She was afraid, "He will take away my abode."
1.286.16	She said, "Let me pay homage to you. What do you desire? Why did you pierce me?"
1.286.17	He said, "Give a gift to me."
1.286.18	He gave her the twelve-syllabled verse.
1.286.19	She again approached this very Gāyatrī.
1.286.20	She said, "What do you desire from me?"
1.286.21	She said, "Give me your entire self."
1.286.22	Then she said, "What will happen to me?"
1.286.23	He said, "There will be common food and drink. I will place you in front of me."
1.286.24	"So be it."
1.286.25	He placed her in front.
1.286.26	He gave her his entire self.
1.286.27	Because Gayatri gave her entire self, therefore a Brahmin approaches a Kshatriya with his entire self.  
1.286.28	And because Jagati did not give her entire self, that is why the Vid (the commoner) wanders away from the Kshatriya.
1.286.29	Whatever Gāyatrī and Jagatī gave to each other, that became Brihatī.
1.286.30	Therefore, Brihatī has three eight-syllable feet and a twelve-syllable foot.
1.286.31	This Gāyatrī was first joined with the verse "Thou art exalted, O Jātavedas."
1.286.32	This is at the end of the Purohita.
1.286.33	He who knows this obtains either the office of a Purohita or at least the office of a purohita.
1.287.1	Now the Brihatī.
1.287.2	Now the Tristubh.
1.287.3	This is the food of both, the Brahman and the Kshatra.
1.287.4	He who knows this is approached by the food of both the Brahman and the Kṣatra.
1.287.5	Therefore, a Brahmin should not be harmed by a Kshatriya, nor a Kshatriya by a Brahmin.
1.287.6	For their food is the same.
1.287.7	Therefore, when a Brahmin goes to a great place, he wants the Kshatriya to be the second protector of that food.
1.287.8	When a Kshatriya goes to a Brahmin.
1.287.9	One who knows this finds a Kshatriya as a husband.
1.287.10	The four syllables were the original metres, not fit for sacrifice.
1.287.11	Then Indra's Soma was in heaven.
1.287.12	The Gandharvas, the Hotṛ-priests, and the serpents, they protected him.
1.287.13	They are the same as the serpents.
1.287.14	He was on the golden grass.
1.287.15	They fell upon him in a moment.
1.287.16	These metres said, "Let us bring Soma and perform the sacrifice."
1.287.17	The Jagati first fell down, thinking itself the most powerful, the strongest, the most abundant, and the most vigorous.
1.287.18	The Soma-guardians found three syllables for it when it had gone away.
1.287.19	It returned with one syllable, bringing the consecration and cattle.
1.287.20	Therefore, he who has cattle, he is initiated and brought near.
1.287.21	Then the Tristubh fell down.
1.287.22	The Soma-guardians found one syllable for her who had gone away.
1.287.23	She came back with three syllables, bringing penance and Dakshina.
1.287.24	Therefore, Dakshina is given in the world of Tristubh.
1.287.25	Therefore, they think that he alone is the one who is performing austerities, who gives.
1.288.1	Then Gāyatrī flew up.
1.288.2	Her mother Anushtup followed her after death.
1.288.3	Therefore, a mother should follow her son who has gone after death, thinking, "May he come back alive, bringing (wealth)."
1.288.4	She took the two Savanas with her two hands. With her mouth she took the one Savana.
1.288.5	She came with the entire sacrifice.
1.288.6	They say that the third Savana is like a daughter, for she brought it with her mouth.
1.288.7	Having brought Soma, she said, "These other metres have come. I have brought this Soma, I have performed this sacrifice."
1.288.8	They said, "We will not give you a share. You are not ours."
1.288.9	She, using the Gayatri metre at the morning pressing, said, "I will speak this."
1.288.10	He took it.
1.288.11	He established it.
1.288.12	Therefore, the morning pressing is called Gāyatrī.
1.288.13	She brought the midday pressing.
1.288.14	Her work was done with three (verses).
1.288.15	Then she became afraid of being surpassed by the Tristubh.
1.288.16	She said, "I am coming."
1.288.17	He said, "Come."
1.288.18	"I will tell you, but you must speak."
1.288.19	He approached her with three syllables.
1.288.20	She, having become the Tristubh with eleven syllables, carried the midday pressing.
1.288.21	He established it.
1.288.22	When she said, "I will tell you, but you must speak," therefore the midday pressing is called "Tristubha".
1.288.23	She brought this third pressing.
1.288.24	For her it was done with three (verses).
1.288.25	Then the Jagati became diminished.
1.288.26	She said, "I have come."
1.288.27	He said, "Come."
1.288.28	"I will tell you, but you must speak."
1.288.29	He approached her with one syllable.
1.288.30	It became the Jagati with twelve syllables and carried the third pressing.
1.288.31	It was established.
1.288.32	When it said, "I will tell you, but you must speak," that is why the third pressing is called Jagat.
1.289.1	The Gayatri carries the morning pressing, the Gayatri carries the midday pressing, the Gayatrī carries the third pressing.
1.289.2	He who knows this, his fame and glory do not perish.
1.289.3	Aruni said, "I know that Gāyatrī carries all the Savanas.
1.289.4	Therefore my fame and glory do no perish."
1.289.5	The fame of him who knows this does not perish.
1.289.6	These metres said, "She is indeed our best, she is the most powerful, who brought Soma and established the sacrifice."
1.289.7	"We shall go to her."
1.289.8	The Tristubh and Jagati metres went to her at the two pressings.
1.289.9	Now, since the Uṣṇīṣa and Kakubha have two eight-syllabled feet, therefore they also became (the same).
1.289.10	Now, since the Brihatī has three eight-syllable feet, therefore it also became (thesame).
1.289.11	Now, because the Anushtubh has four eight-syllablefeet, therefore it also becomes (the same). Now, because the Paṅkti has five eight-syllable
1.289.12	feet, therefore it becomes (the same)
1.290.1	The Gāyatrī is ten syllables long.
1.290.2	She made the eight-syllabled verses out of desire for the Apāyanas.
1.290.3	If one finds an eight-syllable verse in any of the metres, then by that one attains all the metres.
1.290.4	He who knows this, all the metres go into the Gayatri. Thus his own people know him as the best.
1.290.5	They say, "The Stotras go beyond the Trivrit, not the Gayatri metres."
1.290.6	One should not say, "The stotras do not go beyond the Trivrta, nor the Gayatri metres.
1.290.7	The Stomas are three-fold, the Madhyas are three-fold and the Udayas are three-foll.
1.290.8	All the metres are included in the Gāyatrī.
1.290.9	Then Hāupavi asked Āruṇi Āruṇa, "For whom does the Anushtubh Yajña rise?"
1.290.10	He did not reply.
1.290.11	He said, "O Ajina, to whom do I speak? To whom does Gautama say that I am speaking?" "He says to me, 'Gautama, you are speaking to me."
1.290.12	If he had replied, "Prajapati is the Anushtup. Prajapati is the one who is being spoken to. Who is trying to raise Prajapati?" he would have replied.
1.290.13	But that is not always so.
1.290.14	All the metres are included in the Brihatī. The Brihatī is the heavenly world. Which one does he undertake for the heavenly world? He would have replied, 'The Brihatī.'
1.291.1	They discuss whether one should offer with the Rathantara or with the Brihat.
1.291.2	The Savayasa say, 'With the Rathantara.'
1.291.3	This is the Rathantara.
1.291.4	This we know.
1.291.5	Who would go from the known to the unknown?
1.291.6	Just as one sees the very dark when a well is dug deep, so beyond the sky is that world.
1.291.7	Who knows if there is anything there or not?
1.291.8	But indeed, that world is in this world itself.
1.291.9	For this world lives by giving to that world.
1.291.10	Those oblations that go to the heaven, they sustain that world.
1.291.11	He who offers ten times, should offer with the Rathantara chant.
1.291.12	Those who know the sacrifice of Aruṇi Satyayajña say that one should offer with the Brihat chant.
1.291.13	The Brihat is here.
1.291.14	It has been undertaken here, removed from sin, for tomorrow.
1.291.15	They do not despise, they do not despise, nor do they despise.
1.291.16	Many in this world condemn.
1.291.17	Many reflect.
1.291.18	Both the virtuous and the sinful live in this world.
1.291.19	Then the one who has undertaken the vow, having removed sin, will live tomorrow.
1.291.20	There is no sinful one living in the other world.
1.291.21	Indeed, this world always depends on the other world.
1.291.22	For this world lives by the gifts from yonder world.
1.291.23	For the rain that is given from yonder world, this world lives by it.
1.291.24	He who performs ten sacrifices should perform them with the Brihat-saman.
1.291.25	One should perform with both Samans. So said Satyayani. For the attainment of both desires.
1.291.26	Thus both of them obtain their desires.
1.291.27	This is his entire Sama Veda, which carries the sacrifice.
1.292.1	Its Hinkara is indeed the Gayatri.
1.292.2	The Rastava is the Rathantara.
1.292.3	The Udgitha is the Vamadevas.
1.292.4	The Pratihara is the Brihat.
1.292.5	The Nidhana is the Yagyayajniya.
1.292.6	Each of these indeed rules over a part of the heavenly world.
1.292.7	He who knows this attains the world of heaven.
1.292.8	And indeed this is the Arky (hymn).
1.292.9	This is the great vow.
1.292.10	Its head is the Gāyatrī.
1.292.11	The wings are the Bṛhat and the Rathantara.
1.292.12	The body is the Vāmadevya.
1.292.13	The tail is the Yajñāyajñiya.
1.292.14	He who knows this attains as much as one attains by the Arky and the great vow.
1.292.15	Now, indeed, this is the fulfilment of life.
1.292.16	Life is the Gayatri.
1.292.17	The Rathantara is the life of all.
1.292.18	The Vamadevya is the life of the same.
1.292.19	The Brihat is the life of everything.
1.292.20	The Yajnayajniya is the life beyond.
1.292.21	Those who praise with this become long-lived.
1.292.22	Then indeed these five lights shine in these worlds: Agni on earth, Vayu in the sky, Aditya in heaven, the moon in the stars, and lightning in the water.
1.292.23	Agni is the Rathantara.
1.292.24	Vayu is the Vamadevya.
1.292.25	Aditya is the Brihat.
1.292.26	The moon is the Gayatri.
1.293.3	The ocean is the end of this (universe).
1.293.4	The great (universe) is beyond that.
1.293.5	There is no end to that (universe).
1.293.6	Thus indeed, one sees the ocean beyond that.
1.293.7	He who knows thus the end of the great and the Rathantera (universe) as having an end and being endless, and who knows the end of the Veda, conquers the endless world of heaven.
1.293.8	He who knows the Stoma of the Brihat and Rathantara Samans, and the Stotriya Saman, becomes one who has Stoma.
1.293.9	"He praises with this (verse), "This is our best."
1.293.10	"He praises (Indra) with the Stomya verses, "We praise thee, O hero, like milked cows, the lord of this world, the lord of the standing ones."
1.293.11	But no one else, divine or human, has been born or will be born. These are the praises.
1.293.12	O Indra, O Maghavan, O steed-winner, O winner of cattle, we call you. This is as if it were a request, as if it were said to be valour.
1.293.13	He who knows thus the Stoma and Stotriya of these two, Brihat and Rathantara, becomes one who has Stoma.
1.293.14	"When he praises him with this (verse), 'He is our best.'
1.293.15	And by this very knowledge, all the verses are known.
1.294.1	Brihat and Rathantara were created.
1.294.2	After that, cattle were created.
1.294.3	Those who were Rathantara followed the Rathantara.
1.294.4	Those who belonged to the Brihat followed the Brihat.
1.294.5	He found them together.
1.294.6	It stood out, separating them.
1.294.7	They said, "If we are to be like this,
1.294.8	then we will not be able to support offspring."
1.294.9	"Let us exchange our forms."
1.294.10	They exchanged their forms.
1.294.11	The speech that was Rāthantara entered the animals of the Bharata (people).
1.294.12	The speech that belonged to the Bharata (clan) entered the animals of Rāthantaras.
1.295.3	They said, "Let us both enter him."
1.295.4	"So be it."
1.295.5	They both entered him.
1.295.6	Therefore a man speaks both kinds of speech, the Rathantara and the Bharata.
1.295.7	Those who are Rathantara cattle see his Rathantara speech and approach it.
1.295.8	Those who belong to the Bharata are Bharata.
1.295.9	The man is the common ground of the Brihat and Rathantara.
1.295.10	He who knows this, that the man is the common point of the Brihat & Rathantara, to him both kinds of cattle, those belonging to the Rathantara and those belonging to the Brihat, cry out.
1.295.11	He who thus knows the man as the common point of Brihat and Rathantaras,
1.295.12	to him the common point of both is known.
1.296.1	The Udicyas, when Aruṇi was going away, said to him: "Aruṇi, Aruṇi, by how much do you generate the progeny of Bṛhadratha? By how much do you make us famous?"
1.296.2	He did not reply.
1.296.3	He said, "I know this. If you want, I will tell you. But I will not tell you if you do not want."
1.296.4	Then the students looked at him and said, "This one is ignorant." He replied thus:
1.296.5	"Perhaps he did not understand it."
1.296.6	"Let us ask him."
1.296.7	They said to him, "What will you reply? How will you reply?"
1.296.8	He said, "If one recites the first verse with the eight-syllabled (mantra), one generates animals with eight kinds of nourishment.
1.296.9	The two syllables of the first and the last (verses) are the two feet.
1.296.10	"He would have said, 'We have indeed brought down the divine fame by means of the Nidhana.' He said, 'What would you have said?'"
1.296.11	"He who knows the divine invocation of the Brihat and Rathantara, the gods attend his call."
1.296.12	The divine invocation of the Rathantara is upward, of the Brihat downward.
1.296.13	Now, when he chants the Rāthantara Sāman, which is above the two Stomas, it is as if he chants upwards. Therefore this world is above, this Agni burns above, the plants are above, the trees are above, everything is above.
1.296.14	Now, because he chants the Paristubh and Ho from the Brihat, therefore this world is below, and this sun shines below, and the moon is below, and the stars are below, and the rain comes below. Everything is below.
1.296.15	He who knows thus the two, the Brihat and the Rathantara, as the call of the gods, the gods attend to his call.
1.297.1	The Brihat and the Rathaantara were created.
1.297.2	After that the cattle were created.
1.297.3	Those who were Rathantara were created after the Rathantara.
1.297.4	Those who are Bṛhat were created after the Bṛhat.
1.297.5	Those who belong to the Rathantara are the first cattle.
1.297.6	Now those who are connected with the Rathantara are the eaters.
1.297.7	Because he begins the Rathantara with the Arci, which is not a Tristubh, therefore the animals connected with the Rathantara have bone as their support and are the first.
1.297.8	Because he commences the Bṛhat with the Stobha, which is a Tristubh verse, therefore the animals belonging to the Bṛhat have flesh as their support and they are the eaters.
1.297.9	The Attuh (hymn) is the first, full of laughter, from it the hero is born, who knows thus.
1.297.10	Brihat and Rathantara are in the middle, they bear the foetus in the offspring.
1.297.11	Therefore one generates at the end with the Yajñāyajñiya (hymn).
1.297.12	When one recites the first verse with the eight-syllabled (hymn), one bears the foetus of animals with eight kinds of nourishment.
1.297.13	The two syllables of the last two feet are the two feet.
1.297.14	That which is performed at the end of the Yajñāyajñiya hymn is indeed the birth itself.
1.297.15	It is indeed the birth.
1.297.16	Therefore, one should give a boon at the Yajñayajñiya hymn.
1.297.17	Just as a boon is given when a son is born, so is it.
1.297.18	That is indeed the birth of the sacrificer.
1.297.19	Now those waters which the wife lets flow forth, they are the waters which flow forth when the garment is torn there.
1.297.20	And water is food.
1.297.21	What food is given to the born, that is this.
1.297.22	And it ends with a speech.
1.297.23	Therefore even the child, as soon as he is born, utters a cry.
1.298.1	They were born in the Brihat and Rathantara.
1.298.2	They were born in the same or different places.
1.298.3	They said, "Let us have a race to the end of these two."
1.298.4	"So be it."
1.298.5	They ran a race.
1.298.6	The Brihat won.
1.298.7	The Rathantara thought it was losing.
1.298.8	It said, "Give me the sequence of the Yoga at the end of the pair."
1.298.9	"So be it."
1.298.10	That became its pair.
1.298.11	Therefore he gave this Yoga first, this in the morning.
1.298.12	The morning is indeed the Yoga of the Rathantara, the afternoon of the Brihat.
1.298.13	"The horse" is of the Rathantara; "the horse" is of Brihat.
1.298.14	They are the final rites of the day and of truth.
1.298.15	For truth is indeed the final rite of these two.
1.298.16	Therefore one should offer sacrifice to the Yajamana with both (the verses) together.
1.298.17	Both the Brihat and the Rathantara are obtained, (and) truth.
1.298.18	For both the Brihat and Rathantara are obtained by him.
1.298.19	They say: The Brihat and Rathantaras are the final rites within (the sacrifice), and the final rites outside.
1.298.20	He should say both. That is, in the case of internal and external disposal.
1.298.21	This indeed is the Rathantara.
1.298.22	The Brihat is beyond that.
1.298.23	Of these two, this indeed is the internal disposal.
1.298.24	Therefore, it is internal disposal.
1.298.25	And that which is beyond heaven and space, they consider as the earth and water. Therefore, it is external disposal.
1.298.26	They say that the Vamadevya is between the Brihat and the Rathantara, and the Brihat and Rathantara are between the Vamadevyas.
1.298.27	One should say both. The Vamadevya between the Brihat-Rathantara, and the Rathantara-Brihat between the Vamadevas.
1.298.28	This is the Rathantara.
1.298.29	The Brihat is below.
1.298.30	This is indeed the Vamadevy in the sky.
1.298.31	Therefore, the Vamadevya is between the Brihat and Rathantara.
1.298.32	And because they consider the sky beyond that, and the earth beyond that, therefore the Vamadevyas are between the Brihatand Rathantara.
1.299.1	Prajapati, from whom he created offspring, became radiant.
1.299.2	He stood shining and glowing.
1.299.3	He knew, "There is indeed something within."
1.299.4	He said to the gods, "There is something within here. Create it."
1.299.5	Agni created the Gayatri verses.
1.299.6	Indra created the Tristubh verses with the concluding verses.
1.299.7	The All-gods created the Jagati verses.
1.299.8	Prajapati created the Anushtubh verses.
1.299.9	That which is Gāyatrī, with Svaras, is Agni, that is its deity.
1.299.10	That which is Trishtubh, with Nidhanas, is Indra, that is its deit.
1.299.11	That which has Jagat, is Iḍa, is Vaishvadev, that is its diety.
1.299.12	That which consists of Anushtup, is Rksam, is Prajapati, that is its divinity.
1.299.13	And indeed, the Soma-drinking priests, Brihadratha and Ratha, have arranged the sacrifice.
1.299.14	Both of them are either inside or outside.
1.299.15	They make the sacrifice equal to the Svaras and the Rks.
1.299.16	What is sung within the Rk is the Rathantara.
1.299.17	What is oversung in the Rk is Bharata.
1.300.1	They say, how many Sama-s are there?
1.300.2	One should say four.
1.300.3	There are four kinds of Sama-s: Svaram, Nidhanavat, Aidam, and Rksam.
1.300.4	There are four directions.
1.300.5	There are animals with four feet.
1.300.6	There are the four metres: Gayatri, Tristubh, Jagati, and Anushtubh.
1.300.7	They are three: Svaram, nidhanavat, and Aidam.
1.300.8	What is Rksam is Svaram.
1.300.9	The sacrifice is threefold.
1.300.10	There are three kinds of breath: the prāṇa, apāna and vyāna.
1.300.11	These are the three worlds.
1.300.12	They are indeed two: the Svara and the Nidhana.
1.300.13	The Nidhana is indeed the Ida.
1.300.14	These two worlds are like the two eyes.
1.300.15	There are two kinds of breath: prāṇa and apāna.
1.300.16	Man has two feet.
1.300.17	That is indeed one: the Svara alone.
1.300.18	Whatever is the end, whatever is the Veda, that is the Svarā itself.
1.300.19	This is the one Svarā, the Svarā itself,
1.300.20	which blows here.
1.300.21	And those that fly above and those that creep below, they all live on this Svarā, the breath.
1.300.22	He who knows this attains the whole of life.
1.300.23	He who, knowing this, makes a sacrifice to the unborn, his sacrifice becomes successful.
1.300.24	But if he were to make a sacrifice to the Unborn, it would be as if he were making a sacrifice to the Born.
1.300.25	For the Unborn is not a couple, not a procreator, as the Born is.
1.300.26	As if two men were to lie together, or two women.
1.300.27	Whether two men lie together or two women, would they beget? If they do not find a person to unite them.
1.300.28	Then whatever is not a male or female, that is the union, that is the begetting.
1.300.29	The self is the Svara.
1.300.30	The offspring is the Nidhana.
1.300.31	The cattle is the Ida.
1.300.32	The Jayar is equal.
1.300.33	The self and the wife are equal.
1.300.34	Those are his own offspring, his cattle, which are held on both sides for the purpose of not letting them go away.
1.300.35	He whose knowledge is thus, his wealth is not taken away by others.
1.301.1	One should not hand over these sacrificial fees.
1.301.2	One should do it with one's own voice.
1.301.3	The voice is the breath.
1.301.4	One should hand over that breath with the breath.
1.301.5	The sacrificer would be short-lived.
1.301.6	If one were to do it at the end of the sacrifice, one should offer the thunderbolt at the end of it.
1.301.7	A great battle would take place in that half.
1.301.8	The staff would strike the Udgātṛ and the arrow the sacrificer.
1.301.9	If one were to do (the sacrifice) at the end of Ida, one should offer animals at the end of animals.
1.301.10	Maheśvara would pacify the animals of half of that.
1.301.11	The Udgātṛ would be defeated by all the Jāyanis.
1.301.12	The sacrificer would be led to non-return.
1.301.13	If one were to perform together with the Rk, his wife would be prone to death or the last one would kill the sacrificer.
1.301.14	This indeed is the last death, which is the one that is not destroyed.
1.302.1	The tiger is the thief.
1.302.2	Therefore one should not hand over these deposits, lest they be lost.
1.302.3	These are indeed the four kinds of wealth, belonging to the four sages.
1.302.4	They say, who is the lord of heedfulness?
1.302.5	One indeed becomes heedless.
1.302.6	If he were to perform it with the Svara, then he would be making the life-force greater than the Svara. He should think there, 'I shall live longer.'
1.302.7	If he were to perform with the Nidhana, then he would establish the offspring in the offspring. He should think, 'I shall be prosperous with offspring.'
1.302.8	And the Nidhana is indeed the thunderbolt.
1.302.9	This is indeed the thunderbolt, which he hurls at his hateful brother.
1.302.10	If one were to perform the Iḍa together with the Agnihotra, then the Iḍa would be the cattle, and he would be sowing cattle in cattle. One should think there, "I shall be one who has many cattle."
1.302.11	If one were to do it with the Rksamas, then it would be a procreation with the Rksamasa. This is a procreation of procreation. One should think there, "I shall be many, I shall procreate."
1.302.12	Thus indeed, it does not exceed him.
1.302.13	He who would have done this to him, should be asked: "Did you do well?" He should be told: "I did it well, not badly."
1.302.14	"Whatever you know here as bad, that will be yours."
1.302.15	"If you did the officiating priest's work before the Samaveda, then it was done by you."
1.302.16	He alone suffers pain who reviles one who knows this.
1.303.1	One should go from these three forms to the midday, to the one from Andhas, to the one of Maruts, to the one who is Prna.
1.303.2	Andhas is food.
1.303.3	Maruts are energy.
1.303.4	Prna is heaven.
1.303.5	If one goes to the one from the Andhas, one goes to the food.
1.303.6	If one goes to the Marutvat, one goes to the strength.
1.303.7	If one goes to the Pratnavat, one goes from the heavenly world.
1.303.8	If one does not find a place for all of them, one should go to the Marutvata.
1.303.9	The Marutvata is strength.
1.303.10	Strength is what is done by action.
1.303.11	By strength one attains everything.
1.303.12	Therefore one should not go beyond the Maruts.
1.303.13	Then he ascends the Gāyatrī in the Svarā (tone).
1.303.14	The Svarā is the Prāṇa.
1.303.15	By means of Prāṇa, he ascends the Prāṇa here.
1.303.16	The Prāṇa does not injure the Prāṇa at all.
1.303.17	When he ascends the Svarā Gāyatrī, he first establishes the Prāṇa in the sacrifice.
1.303.18	Therefore this Prāṇa is the first to be offered.
1.303.19	Now this (Prāṇa) is connected with Agni as deity, since it is Svara.
1.303.20	This (Prāṇa), indeed, is connected with Agni, as the Gāyatrī metre.
1.303.21	He mounts Agni by means of Agni.
1.303.22	Agni is the path-maker of the deities.
1.303.23	Whichever way Agni goes, he makes a path.
1.303.24	When he ascends the Gāyatrī with his voice, then he yokes Agni, the path-maker, to the sacrifice at the very beginning.
1.303.25	He follows the path made by Agni.
1.303.26	Just as one goes along a path, so he attains the goal safely and without harm, he who, knowing this, ascends the Gãyatrī with his own voice.
1.304.1	With the second, the Nidhana, he ascends.
1.304.2	The Nidhana is indeed the Nidhana.
1.304.3	Indra is indeed the chief of the deities.
1.304.4	Where the chief enters the village, there is no misfortune.
1.304.5	He who, knowing this, ascends with the second, the nidhana, attains prosperity and well-being.
1.304.6	Now, indeed, Indra and Agni are the most powerful deities.
1.304.7	One should use them as the most powerful and best deities.
1.304.8	Then he ascends this Brihatī with the Ida.
1.304.9	Ida is cattle.
1.304.10	Brihatī is cattle.
1.304.11	He thus makes cattle equal to cattle.
1.304.12	The animals are indeed more beautiful when they are united with other animals.
1.304.13	If one were to ascend with the Nidhana, one would turn the thunderbolt against the animals.
1.304.14	If he does not find a place for Ida, he should ascend with the Svara.
1.304.15	The Svara is the breath.
1.304.16	The animals are the Brihatī.
1.304.17	He thus places the breath in the animals.
1.304.18	Then it becomes the second, with three layers.
1.304.19	There are three worlds.
1.304.20	These are the worlds, these are the layers.
1.304.21	From these worlds, with these layers, he removes all evil.
1.304.22	And these layers stand in these worlds, repelling all evil.
1.304.23	There are also three holes in the sacrifice.
1.304.24	He places both of them.
1.304.25	One becomes his own abode.
1.305.1	Then he ascends this Triṣṭubh with the Svaras.
1.305.2	The Svaras are the Prāṇas.
1.305.3	This Pavamāna is equal to a man.
1.305.4	There is a Svarā in front and a Svarā above.
1.305.5	These two are the Prāṇa and Apāna of this man, inverted.
1.305.6	He sings with them, turning around.
1.305.7	Then the Rathantara.
1.305.8	That is the sprinkling of semen.
1.305.9	Then the Vamadevya, the Svaram.
1.305.10	The Svaram is indeed the breath.
1.305.11	Here he restores the breath to the semen that has been sprinkled.
1.305.12	Then the Naudasa, the Nidhana.
1.305.13	That is indeed birth.
1.305.14	He generates it by that.
1.305.15	Then the Kalayai, the Ida.
1.305.16	The Ida is indeed the cattle.
1.305.17	Cattle are food.
1.305.18	Whatever food is given to the born, that is this.
1.305.19	The Gāyatrī of Arbhava Pavamāna is mentioned in the Brahmanas.
1.305.20	Then he ascends the Kakubha with the Svaras.
1.305.21	The Svaras are the Prāṇa.
1.305.22	The Kakubha is indeed the Vivṛha.
1.305.23	He indeed places the Prāṇa in the Vivṛha.
1.305.24	If he were to ascend it with the Nidhana, then it would be like striking with a stick a person who is already suffering.
1.305.25	If he were to ascend with the Svara, then he would be placing the breath in her.
1.305.26	He heals her with this.
1.305.27	Then he ascends the Ushniha with the Nidhana.
1.305.28	The Nidhana is indeed the thunderbolt.
1.305.29	The Ushniha is the cattle.
1.305.30	The animals are now like the aged ones at the third pressing.
1.305.31	Therefore they say, "One should offer an aged animal, for it serves the purpose."
1.305.32	And they enjoy the prosperity by striking with the thunderbolt and the thunderbolt-like weapon.
1.305.33	And when they describe the Brihatī with the Nidhana, the animals are now like young ones, not aged.
1.305.34	Therefore they call the young animal a living foot.
1.306.1	Then he ascends this Anushtubh with the voice.
1.306.2	The voice is the breath.
1.306.3	The Anushtubh is speech.
1.306.4	This is indeed the divine pair, namely, speech and breath.
1.306.5	He thus establishes that divine pair.
1.306.6	If he were to ascend with the Nidhana, then the Nidhana is like a thunderbolt, and the divine pair would be destroyed by the thunderbolt.
1.306.7	If he does not find a place for the Svaras, he should ascend with the Nidhanas.
1.306.8	Speech is the Anushtubh.
1.306.9	Speech is Nidhana.
1.306.10	Speech does not injure speech.
1.306.11	Now this middle Nidhana becomes the second.
1.306.12	Speech is Anushtubh.
1.306.13	Now, the middle-ending of the speech is the seed-sowing.
1.306.14	It becomes the Sahikara.
1.306.15	The navel is the Hiṃkāra.
1.306.16	The embryo is indeed held by the navel, from the lower parts of the navel, it does not fall down.
1.306.17	The embryo indeed is held by the navel.
1.306.18	This has ten syllables in the middle-ending.
1.306.19	The Viraj has ten syllables.
1.306.20	Food is Viraj.
1.306.21	Indeed, the embryos live on food.
1.306.22	Then he ascends this Jagati with the Svaras.
1.306.23	The Svaras are the breath.
1.306.24	This Pavamana is equal to a man.
1.306.25	There is a Svaras in front and a Svaras above.
1.306.26	These two are the inverted Prāṇa and Apāna of this man.
1.306.27	He sings with them.
1.306.28	Then the Yajñāyajñiya.
1.306.29	That is the spreading of semen.
1.306.30	Then the Saakamaasvaṃ Svaram.
1.306.31	Svarah is indeed the breath.
1.306.32	Herein he places the breath in the semen that has been spread.
1.306.33	Then the Sauvaram Nidhanam.
1.306.34	That is indeed birth.
1.306.35	He generates it by that.
1.306.36	Then the Narmedha Ida.
1.306.37	Ida is indeed cattle.
1.306.38	Food is cattle.
1.306.39	Whatever food is given to the born, that is this.
1.306.40	Thus the first section, thus the second, thus the third.
1.307.1	There are three kinds of Nidhana: Nidhana, Nidhana itself, and Nidhana.
1.307.2	And what is equal to a verse, that is indeed Svaram.
1.307.3	For the equality of a verse and Svaram is the same as the equality of a cow and a bull.
1.307.4-11	This world is Ida. Cattle are Ida. Cattle is this world. This very space is Svarah. Breath is Svarah. Breath is space. This very world is the Nidhanam. Movement, support.
1.307.12	Now, those who are not defeated, should arrange them in the order of the Veda. One should first perform the Iḍa, then the Svarā, then the Nidhanavats.
1.307.13	For these worlds are in the order of Veda.
1.307.14	The Nidhanavats are indeed the Self.
1.307.15	The Svaras are the breath.
1.307.16	The Iḍas are the cattle.
1.307.17	Now, when the Iḍa and the Nidhana are performed between the Svaras, then all these vital forces become continuous.
1.307.18	For this breath is in the middle, and it spreads out the creatures, the animals, and the worlds.
1.307.19	And indeed, when the Brhat and the Rathantara Sāmans were divided,
1.308.1	the Rathantara ones became some, and the Bṛhat ones became others.
1.308.2	Now those in which they were equal, they were Rāthantara and Bāhrata, and Bāhratarāthantara.
1.308.3	That which is the Rāthantara, it has the Rk and Prāstāra within the Nidhana.
1.308.4	And that which is the Bāhrata has the Stobha before and the Nidhana outside.
1.308.5	And that in which the Rk and the Prāstāra have the Nidhana outside, that is the Rāthanatarāthantara.
1.308.6	Now, the Stobha which is in front and the Antardhana which is at the end, that is the Rathantara and the Bārahara.
1.308.7	They say, how many Sama-s are there?
1.308.8	One should say four.
1.308.9	There are four Sama-s, namely, the Rathantara, the Bārahāra, the Rathantara-Bārahāra and the Bārabara-Rathantara.
1.308.10	If one were to arrange them in the order of the Ajami, one should first arrange the Rathantara, then the Bharata, then the Rathantara-Bharata, then the Bharta-Rathantara.
1.308.11	Thus he arranges the four Samas with six forms.
1.308.12	If one were to arrange the forms of the Ajami,
1.309.1	That is the Sukta.
1.309.2	One should begin with the Gayatri with the Nidhanas.
1.309.3	The Nidhanas are the Vidyas.
1.309.4	The Gayatri is the Vidyas
1.309.5	He makes that Vidyas prosper with the Vidyas itself.
1.309.6	One should commence with the Brihatis with the Ida.
1.309.7	The Ida is the cattle.
1.309.8	The Brihatis are the cattle.
1.309.9	He makes those cattle prosper with the cattle itself.
1.309.10	The last one is the Svaras.
1.309.11	The Svaras is the breath.
1.309.12-21	The Prāṇa is the last. He who knows this attains the whole life. The Rathantara or the Brihat Sāman is performed with the Nidhana. The Nidhana is the strength. The Sāman is the strength. It is the strength. He makes it complete with strength. The Svarā is the Maitrāvaruṇa Sāman. The Svaras are the Prāṇas. The Prāṇas are the Maitrāvaruṇas. Brahma Sāman has two Aksaras and Nidhana.
1.309.22	The Dvanda is the foundation.
1.309.23	The foundation is the Brahma-saman.
1.309.24	The Aicchavasaka-saman is the Aicchavasa.
1.309.25	The Aidas are the animals.
1.309.26	The Aichhavasaka-samen is the animals.
1.309.27	One should begin the Gayatri of the Rathantara-saman with the internal Nidhana, and the Brihat-saman with external Nidhana.
1.309.28	One should start with the Kakubha in the Svaras.
1.309.29	The Svaras are the breath.
1.309.30	The Kakubha is indeed the expansion.
1.309.31	He indeed places the breath in the very same (place).
1.309.32	One should begin with the Iḍā and the Uṣṇik verse having the Nidhana.
1.309.33	Nidhana is power.
1.309.34	Uṣṇik is power.
1.309.35	Iḍā is cattle.
1.309.36	Uṣnik is cattle.
1.309.37	One should approach her with whatever desire one may have.
1.309.38	One should begin the Anushtubh with the Svara.
1.309.39	Svara is breath.
1.309.40	Anushtubh is speech.
1.309.41	By means of the breath he continues the speech.
1.309.42	He begins the speech with the breath.
1.309.43	The last one is the Svaram.
1.309.44	The breath is the Svaram;
1.309.45	The breath is last;
1.309.46	He who knows this attains the whole life.
1.310.1	The Yajnayajniya is concluded with speech.
1.310.2	This entire sacrifice is concluded in speech.
1.310.3	He who knows this does not fail to attain his desires.
1.310.4	For there is no failure in speech.
1.310.5	O Marutvan, do not obstruct the midday sun.
1.310.6	For he is the one who has form, he is the one with power.
1.310.7	In the Gāyatrī verses, one should recite the Rathantara Sāman, and in the Tristubh verses, the Brhat Sāman.
1.310.8	One should make the Uttama verse of the Brhatī Sāman the third.
1.310.9	Whatever is deficient in the sacrifice, that he appeases by that.
1.310.10	May the young ones not be deprived of their mother and father.
1.310.11	For by that he is endowed with form, by that he is powerful.
1.310.12	In the Gāyatrī verses, one should make the Rathantara Sāman, in the Anushtubh verses, the Brhat Sāman.
1.310.13	The middle verse is the Aindra, and the last verse is Anushtubh.
1.310.14	Whatever is deficient in the sacrifice, that he appeases by that.
1.310.15	If he does not recite the Marutvat and Trinidhan in between the Madhyandin and if he does not recite either the Madhyeni-dhana or the Arbhav-dhana in between, then all these are not recited in between.
1.310.16	Then indeed one should not recite the Gāyatrī.
1.310.17	The Aindava Sāman is to be sung in the middle of the Stoma. One should sing the Ekacaras in the Trivṛt Stoma.
1.310.18	The two Sāmans of the Uṣṇiṣṭoma and Kakubha are to be sung in Trivṛt and Pañcadaśa Stomas.
1.310.19	But there is no Ekacaras in Trivṛta Stoma.
1.310.20	There is no Ekacara in the last Stoma, either in the Rk or in the Sāman. That is the place of the Ekacaras. There is no Gāyatrī in the Agnistoma Sāman.
1.311.1	The three wombs of the sacrifice are the Gāyatrī, the Brihatī and the Anushtubh.
1.311.2	Here they pour down.
1.311.3	From here they take up.
1.311.4	It is as if a man in the middle is well-fed or is hungry.
1.311.5	And as the other limbs are fixed, so are the other Stotras fixed.
1.311.6	There are four common (verses) for the Ekarchas, namely the Brihat, Rathantara, Vamadevya and Yagyaya-jya.
1.311.7	Wherever they may be found, they should be placed in the Trichas, not in the Ekachas.
1.311.8	If one were to place them in the Ekachasa,
1.311.9	it would be as if one were to make it without vigour.
1.311.10	The Ekachas is this world.
1.311.11	Or this (world) is as if cut off from these two worlds.
1.311.12	The Triṣṭubh is more vigorous.
1.311.13	There are three of these worlds.
1.311.14	These worlds are Triṣṭubha.
1.311.15	Three are more vigorous than one.
1.311.16	From this, the greater one thinks that the lesser one is superior.
1.311.17	The greater the distance, the greater the power, the more he accomplishes with three verses.
1.311.18	The lesser the distance, the lesser the power, the less he accomplishes with one verse.
1.311.19	One verse is greater than three.
1.311.20	One verse has three syllables.
1.311.21	Three verses have two.
1.311.22-24	He who knows these verses of the Rk and the verses of the Chhandas, for him both the verses are made. Both his verses are made. And because the Rk and Sama are the same, therefore his verses are made.
1.312.1	Prajapati, indeed, at the morning pressing, stands, begetting the creatures, in that it is the Bahispavamana.
1.312.2	He, indeed, having become that very deity, approaches this place.
1.312.3	He who knows this world of that deity, his world is thus.
1.312.4	Now the Ajya for Agni.
1.312.5	That indeed is the Stoma of Abhijit.
1.312.6	Agni indeed is that.
1.312.7	He conquered all this.
1.312.8	He became that very deity and attained this state of existence.
1.312.9	He who knows this world as the world of that deity, he is indeed a knower of the world.
1.312.10	Then the Maitrāvaruṇa oblation.
1.312.11	It is indeed the Stoma of Viśvajit.
1.312.12	The day and night are indeed those two.
1.312.13	Day indeed is Mitra,
1.312.14	Night is indeed Varuna.
1.312.15	Those who are on the other side of the sun, they all attain the day and night.
1.312.16	But those who know thus do not attain the world.
1.312.17	He becomes that very deity and attains this world.
1.312.18	He who knows this world of that deity, he knows the world.
1.312.19	Now the Indra-offering.
1.312.20	He is indeed the Stoma of all-conqueror.
1.312.21	Indra alone is that.
1.312.22	For he conquered all this.
1.312.23	He, having become that very deity, attained this abode.
1.312.24	He who knows this world of that deity, his world is thus.
1.312.25	Now the Indra-Agni offering of clarified butter.
1.312.26	That indeed is the Stoma of Udbhid.
1.312.27	Indra and Agni alone are those two.
1.312.28	For they, having united, conquered all this.
1.312.29	He, having become that very deity, attained this state of existence.
1.312.30	He who knows this, his world is indeed like that.
1.313.1	Now the midday Pavamāna.
1.313.2	That indeed is the Stoma of one who wins wealth.
1.313.3	That indeed was Vayu.
1.313.4	Having become this very Prāṇa, he conquered all wealth.
1.313.5	Whatever living thing is conquered, in all that he becomes the conqueror, he who knows this.
1.313.6	He becomes that very deity and attains this state.
1.313.7	He who knows this, his world is the world of this deity.
1.313.8	The Rathantara or the Brihat is the Stoma.
1.313.9	It is indeed the Stoma of prosperity.
1.313.10	For the Stoma is prosperity.
1.313.11	He, having become that very deity, attained this state of being.
1.313.12	He who knows this world as the world of that deity, he indeed has this world.
1.313.13	Now the Vamadevya.
1.313.14	He indeed is the Stoma of Peace.
1.313.15	They are indeed the Waters.
1.313.16	When Agni Vaiśvānara burned this earth, they indeed pacified him with water.
1.313.17	Now, indeed, these two are the two Vaiśvānara fires, namely, the summer and the winter.
1.313.18	And that which is between them, the rainy season, is separated by peace.
1.313.19	He, indeed, having become that very deity, approaches this place of rest.
1.313.20	He who knows this world of that deity, his world is indeed like that.
1.313.21	Then the Naudhasa or the Śyaita Brahman-sāman.
1.313.22	It is indeed the Stoma of all metres.
1.313.23	That is indeed Brahman.
1.313.24	Brahman indeed is all the metres.
1.313.25	He indeed, having become that very deity, attains this state of existence.
1.313.26	He who knows this world of that deity, his world is indeed so.
1.313.27	Then this is the time.
1.313.28	That indeed is the Stoma itself.
1.313.29	That is indeed food.
1.313.30	He who indeed knows this world of the taste of food, his world becomes so.
1.313.31	He, having become that very deity, approaches this place.
1.313.32	He who knows this, his world is indeed the world of that deity.
1.313.33	Now the Pavamāna of Arbhava.
1.313.34	He, indeed, is the Stoma of Asita.
1.313.35	The directions are indeed those.
1.313.36	Indeed, when the directions were departing, sin did not follow them.
1.313.37	Sin does not follow him who knows this.
1.313.38	He, having become that very deity, has attained this state of being.
1.313.39	He who knows this, his world is indeed the world of that deity.
1.313.40	Now the Yajñāyajñiya (hymn).
1.313.41	It is indeed the Stoma in heaven.
1.313.42	It is indeed Aditya.
1.313.43	For he rises for no one.
1.313.44	He, having become that same deity, has attained to this state of being.
1.314.3	"I shall conquer all this."
1.314.4	Having become fire, he conquered the army.
1.314.5	Having become earth, he became the past and the future.
1.314.6	Having become water, he obtained everything.
1.314.7	Having become mind, he understood everything.
1.314.8	Having becomes speech, he spoke everything.
1.314.9	Having became sight, he saw everything.
1.314.10	Having become the ear, he heard everything.
1.314.11	Having become wind, he became the life of beings.
1.314.12	Having become space, he supported heaven.
1.314.13	Having become heaven, he pervaded everything.
1.314.14	Having been Viraj, he became the sun.
1.314.15	Having become desire, he became infinite.
1.314.16	Having become infinite, he became death.
1.314.17	Having become the year, he did not steal.
1.314.18	He does not steal who knows thus.
1.314.19	Having become the moon, he grasped the fortnights.
1.314.20	Having become rain, he became the progenitor of creatures.
1.314.21	Having become sacrifice, he nourishes the gods.
1.314.22	These his created creatures did not know each other.
1.314.23	Having become name, he entered them.
1.314.24	They know her by the name, "This is the son of so and so."
1.314.25	This is indeed Agniṣṭoma, this is indeed Indra, this is indeed Prajāpati, this is indeed all this.
1.315.1	He sings in Retasyā.
1.315.2	Retasyā is indeed semen.
1.315.3	For the continuity of semen, for non-interruption.
1.315.4	He sings Ahinkṛtā.
1.315.5	The sound "Hiṃ" is indeed the thunderbolt.
1.315.6	If one were to do it with the Vajra, one would cut off semen with the sound of the Vajra.
1.315.7	If it were one day, one should sing the Ahiṃkāra on that day.
1.315.8	Because that day is one.
1.315.9	If it is two days, one should sing Ahiṃkāra for both days.
1.315.10	One of them is the Prāyana (the day of death).
1.315.11	The other is the Udayana (the day of birth).
1.315.12	If they debate for three days, whether to hiss or not to hiss.
1.315.13	Some say that one should sing the hymn of the unhissing (goddess) every day for a year.
1.315.14	For a year, the seed is made to grow.
1.315.15	By making the seed grow.
1.315.16	Śāṭyāyani said, "The embryo is formed from the first semen that is deposited."
1.315.17	And the semen that is deposited later is deposited in the same place."
1.315.18	Therefore, one should sing the "Hiṅkāra" in the first morning, and the "Hiṅkṛtā" in the subsequent days.
1.315.19	For the "Hiṅkara" is food.
1.315.20	Food makes the embryo grow.
1.315.21	It is by growth that it grows.
1.315.22	One should sing it in the Udayana (Sāman).
1.315.23	What is the Prāyana is the Udayana.
1.316.1	These Gadūna (Sāmans) were composed by Ārṣaka Kāyanya Śālavātya for Āruṇi.
1.316.2	These are the Āruṇīya Dhuras.
1.316.3	They say, what is the metre of the semen?
1.316.4	One should say it is the Brihatī.
1.316.5	How is it called Brihatī?
1.316.6	One should say, "The mind is the seed."
1.316.7	There is nothing greater than the mind.
1.316.8	And all the vital airs are united with the mind.
1.316.9	All the metres are united with the Brihatī.
1.316.10	Therefore, the Brihatī is the seed.
1.316.11	They ask, "By what is it increased?"
1.316.12	One should say that it is increased by the seed.
1.316.13	All this has grown out of semen.
1.316.14	It has grown out of that which is the mind.
1.316.15	It has also grown out of that, which is the moon. This is the deity.
1.316.16	This is indeed the moon, which is semen.
1.316.17	This is the form of semen, the Soma king, the food of the gods, the essence of all this, accumulated.
1.316.18	All the gods live on it.
1.316.19	Therefore they say, "Soma alone is the king, Brahman"
1.316.20	For all the gods live on him.
1.316.21	Now this is indeed Brahman, namely, semen.
1.316.22	He who, knowing this, praises with the hymn of semen, is praised by Brahman.
1.317.1	He sings the Gayatri.
1.317.2	The Gayatri is indeed the breath.
1.317.3	He places two syllables in it.
1.317.4	He places them thus: "O3rvanas, the shining ones, the gods, the giver."
1.317.5	That is Prāṇa.
1.317.6	That is Vāyu.
1.317.7	He sings the Tristubh.
1.317.8	The Tristubh is the eye.
1.317.9	It has two syllables that shine.
1.317.10	He shines with the six-fold.
1.317.11	That is this eye.
1.317.12	That is that Aditya.
1.317.13	He sings in the Jagatī.
1.317.14	The Jagatī is the ear.
1.317.15	It has four syllables that shine.
1.317.16	The verses Soma and Shukra indicate the Shukravati pada.
1.317.17	This is the ear.
1.317.18	These are the directions.
1.317.19	He sings the Anushtubh.
1.317.20	Speech is the Anushtubha.
1.317.21	He sings it facing west.
1.317.22	He sings a verse whose meaning is known: "I have stepped on the horse, the horse."
1.317.23	He says "Nus."
1.317.24	That is speech.
1.317.25	That is Prajapati.
1.317.26	He sings the Pankti.
1.317.27	The Pankti is the seasons.
1.317.28	It has six syllables. He illuminates it.
1.317.29	"He illuminates the Surya-verse, saying, "Flow, O Surya."
1.318.1	They are the six seasons.
1.318.2	These are the six-wheeled deities.
1.318.3	With these deities the gods drove away the Asuras.
1.318.4	Because they drove away (the Asuras), they became the six-whee
1.318.5	By these goddesses he is praised, who knows this.
1.318.6	He is excluded from all these goddesses, who, knowing this, reviles him.
1.318.7	Some sing this verse, saying, "The unborn are born." They say, "The unborn is born." "The unborn is being born." "The sun is being born."
1.318.8	Śāṭyāyani said, "From where they sing this (Sāman), from there the foetus is confused."
1.318.9	"Where the foetus is stretched out, then it is born."
1.318.10	Therefore this is sung as the Gāyatrī.
1.318.11	They say, "He who knows how to sing it should sing it today."
1.318.12	They say, "We shall sing together in the Bahispavamāna, and we shall sing together in O. We shall make the speech the end."
1.318.13	"Let us sing together with that."
1.318.14	They sing together in the Ajya verses, but not in the Pavamāna verses.
1.318.15	Some say, "We sing together in the ajya verses."
1.318.16	The Jagati metre in the Hotr's Ajya.
1.318.17	The Hotṛ is indeed the Gāyatrī.
1.319.1	This is the verse: "O Agni, come to us, O Vītayas!"
1.319.2	The Gāyatrī of the Maitrāvaruṇa.
1.319.3	The Maitrāvaruṇa is indeed the Gâyatrī.
1.319.4	The verse is: "O Mitra-Varuna, come to us."
1.319.5	The Tristubh of the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin.
1.319.6	The Brāhmaṇâcchaṃsin is indeed the Tristubh.
1.319.7	The verse: "Come to us, for you are the most beautiful."
1.319.8	The Anushtubh is the chant of the Acchāvāka.
1.319.9	For the Acchāvaaka is Anushtubh.
1.319.10	This is the chant: "O Indra and Agni, come to the pressed (Soma)."
1.319.11	Here indeed, they are sung in the proper form.
1.319.12	But he who sings them at the morning pressing, and also at the midday and third pressing, for him they are sung in their proper place.
1.319.13	This is the reason why he sings them at the morning pressing.
1.319.14	And he who sings them at the Morning-pressing, and also at the Midday-pressing, and at the Third pressing, he indeed establishes them in their places.
1.319.15	These are the verses of the hymn.
1.319.16	Here they are sung together.
1.320.1	Thus indeed did Satyayajna, the son of Adhida, say.
1.320.2	He who knows this, and sings the Dhur without omitting it, becomes half of his own people.
1.320.3	Therefore, if one sings the other Dhur, then the Ajya Dhur and the Pavamana Dhur should be sung.
1.320.4	Śāṭyāyani said, "Those who sing are pulling the yoke."
1.320.5	If he sings in the Tristubh metre, then the juice of the Tristubh is placed in the morning Savana.
1.320.6	If he sings the Rāthantara colour, then the juice in the Rāthantaras is placed in the early morning Savana.
1.320.7-9	If he sings the Jagati, he places the juice of the Jagati in the morning pressing. If he sings the Anushtubh, he places speech, which is the Anushtubha, in the morning pressing.
1.320.10	If one were to pour the Agniya oblation into the empty Savana, the two Savanas would be exhausted.
1.320.11	If one were to divide the same sacrificial rite into two, the two tastes would be exhausted. It is indeed so.
1.320.12	It is indeed so. It is indeed the best.
1.320.13	There is no way to make it better.
1.320.14	Therefore one should sing only 'Oṃ' or 'Oṃ'.
1.320.15	Moreover, there are two kinds of speech: mind and speech.
1.320.16	For speech is born from the mind.
1.320.17	Speech becomes the eye of the mind.
1.320.18	The mind carries speech forward.
1.320.19	Speech again carries the mind forward.
1.320.20	That sound which arises from the mind and speech,
1.321.1	That is Indra.
1.321.2	Indra is all the gods.
1.321.3	He indeed leads to the world of the gods, he who knowing thus sings.
1.321.4	Then indeed they lead to the world of Gandharvas, or to the world of Pitrs.
1.321.5	Then indeed all the burdens are included in these two burdens.
1.321.6	Prajapati created the sacrifice.
1.321.7	He gave it to the gods.
1.321.8	He offered the morning pressing with the Gāyatrī metre.
1.321.9	The midday and the third pressing were offered with the Sāman chants.
1.321.10	The midday pressing was offered with the Āmahi-yava-pratipada metre.
1.321.11	The third pressing was offered with Samhita-pratipada.
1.321.12	They performed the sacrifice with these.
1.321.13	Whatever was the head of the Gāyatrīs, that became the Saman.
1.321.14	The gods approached Prajapati and said, "There is only one Sama, namely the Gayatri."
1.321.15	"What was our head in the Gayatri became the Sama."
1.321.16	"Please arrange this sacrifice so that we may all become complete with all parts and immortal."
1.321.17	He extracted six Gāyatrī verses from the morning pressing itself.
1.321.18	He brought three to the midday pressing.
1.321.19	Three to the third pressing.
1.321.20	They asked him, "From where did you bring this? What will happen here?"
1.321.21	He said, "I will pour in the metres here. These will be known by the metres."
1.321.22	He said, "I shall offer these (verses) in the form of the metres. They will be known by the metres." Therefore, they are known by the metres, though they are Gāyatrī verses.
1.321.23	They worshipped them with the same song.
1.321.24	All of them became endowed with limbs, with bodies, and immortal.
1.321.25	He who knows this becomes endowed with limbs, bodies, and immortal.
1.321.26	Therefore, he who knows this becomes better. So said Shatayani.
1.322.1	Now this is the Prajapati-like offering which is performed at the beginning of the Soma-pressing.
1.322.2	This is self-praising, since it is Prajapati.
1.322.3	In that, when it is praised, this greater praise is done when one takes up this 'Om'.
1.322.4	This is the syllable of the sun.
1.322.5	This is the syllable of all the three Vedas.
1.322.6	When he says 'Om', he places the sun in front of him.
1.322.7	Just as one would mix honey with rice, so he places the essence of the Sama Veda with this syllable.
1.322.8	It nourishes.
1.322.9	By this nectar-like hymn, it is praised.
1.322.10	The Kurus say that the Sama is obstructed and then it subsides.
1.322.11	What he recites after the obstruction, that he raises up.
1.322.12	Indeed, this Sama is sung as Sama.
1.322.13	That is well sung, where one sings Sama.
1.322.14-19	"This is the Sama Veda, I am singing the Sama Veda." He should know that he is going to attain supremacy over his kinsmen. He recites, "Purifying, O Soma, you are flowing." There are eight syllables. "You are flowing in the womb of the giver of jewels, in the truth." There are eight. They make sixteen. "You have settled down." There are four.
1.322.20	Then those sixteen are the sixteen-limbed animal.
1.322.21	And those four are the four teats of this animal.
1.322.22	Just as one would milk a milch animal, so does one milk with this song whatever desire one desires.
1.322.23	This is the animal-like (song), says Suchitta Sailna.
1.323.6	Those four are the desires of the Sama Veda, so says Janashruti.
1.323.7	Now, Vaitahasy says, there are only three desires of the Samaveda.
1.323.8	Whatever one does with speech, that is progeny.
1.323.9	Speech is born from the mind.
1.323.10	One should know that if one does something with speech, that becomes one's progeny. One will become endowed with progeny through this.
1.323.11	When one sings a verse, those are the cattle.
1.323.12	The animals are the Rk.
1.323.13	One should know that when one sings the Rk, one becomes endowed with animals.
1.323.14	When one reaches the end of the tone, that is Brahmic splendor.
1.323.15	For the tone is Brahmic splendor.
1.323.16	He who knows this, he knows the Brahman.
1.323.17	All these desires are fulfilled for him who knows this.
1.323.18	This is the truth, the imperishable, namely, 'Om'.
1.323.19	Indeed, these are the thunderbolt-like verses of the Yaudhajayi Saman.
1.323.20	The gods, with this truth, with the words "Om," and with the concluding verses of Yaudhajayi, slew the Asuras, the evil ones, their enemies.
1.323.21	In the same way, one who knows this, with this truth and with the words "Oṃ," and with the closing verses of Yau dhajayi, slays the one he hates, the evil one, his enemy.
1.323.22	That is the three-fold treasure.
1.323.23	There are three worlds.
1.323.24	These are the treasures, these are the vajras.
1.323.25	With these worlds and these vajras, he removes all evil from them.
1.323.26	And then, having removed all evil from these worlds with these vajras, one ascends to heaven with the word "Om".
1.324.1	Now this is the three-beat Uṣan metre.
1.324.2	When the gods and the Asuras were engaged in battle, she said to them, "I am the Tristubh three times."
1.324.3	Because she said, "I am Tristubh three timess," therefore it is Tristubh.
1.324.4	Having praised with this (verse) three times, the gods killed the Asuras, the sinful enemies.
1.324.5	Thus knowing, he recites this three times and destroys the hated evil enemy.
1.324.6	It grows three times.
1.324.7	The sun is indeed triṣṭubh, the white and black man.
1.324.8	This eye is triṣṭubha, the white and the black man.
1.324.9	Having made it complete with the best deity, he sings.
1.324.10	He who, knowing this, sings the Usanasam attains the highest position among his own people.
1.325.1	Now, the Nirbadha and Apasthambha (verses).
1.325.2	When a Sama is being performed, one should mentally strike in this direction the one whom one hates.
1.325.3	He is defeated right there.
1.325.4	When a Sama has been stopped, one should mentally support in this very direction the one whom he hates.
1.325.5	He too is defeated right there.
1.325.6	Then there are three heavenly worlds and three hellish worlds.
1.325.7	When the Purāṇas are being recited, that is a hellish world.
1.325.8	Having brought down the enemy who hates him, one should place oneself in the heavenly world.
1.325.9	When the city is attacked, that is a helish world.
1.325.10	Having brought down the enemy, the adversary, one should place oneself in the world of heaven, which is the place of destruction.
1.325.11	When one is destroyed, one goes to hell after death.
1.325.12	Having brought down the enemy who is the adversary, one places oneself in the world which is the place where one dies.
1.325.13	Śāṭyāyani said, "This is the hymn of the removal of sin, which is above the invocation."
1.325.14	This is the heaven world.
1.325.15	Who would not share it with his enemy?
1.325.16	The one who is mentioned before the invocation alone is the hell.
1.325.17	Having brought down the enemy, one should place oneself in the entire hymn.
1.326.3-7	The Rk is the source of the Saman, which is sung above the Pratihara. The Pratihara is the source of Rk and Saman. The Rk is the origin of the Saman which is sung above Pratihara. The Nidhana is the source of Saman. What is sung above Nidhana is the origin of Rk and the Saman.
1.326.8	He who performs the priestly duties with these two verses and Sāman, which are like the abode, becomes one who has an abode.
1.326.9	Now this is indeed the pair, namely, the verse and the Sāman.
1.326.10	Of these two, that which is true is in the progeny. He conquers that world which is to be conquered by truth.
1.326.11	Speech is the truth of the verse.
1.326.12	The mind is the truth of Sāman.
1.326.13-19	These are indeed the truth of the Rk and the Sama. Truth is in the offspring. He conquers that world which is to be conquered by truth. The Sama should be sung with truth. The Rk with truth. Indeed, the Rk and Sama are the lords of the heavenly world. They indeed lead one to the heavenly world. He who sings them thus is the lord of the heavenly world.
1.326.20	Therefore, it is to be sung in this way.
1.327.1	While being praised with the Rathantara, he touches the earth, saying, "Salutations to the earth, my mother. O Rathantara, do not harm me."
1.327.2	Then he recites the hymn of Agni's greatness: "Whatever greatness is yours in Agni, whatever greatness is yours in the waters, whatever greatness is in your chariot, whatever greatness is of yours in thunder, whatever greatness is your in the wind, by that greatness may I prosper. O Rathantara, may I prosper with wealth."
1.327.3	Then he recites the Vamadevya hymn as a blessing in front: "You are Prajapati, O Vamadevya, the refuge of Brahman. May you protect me."
1.327.4	Then he pronounces the immortal formulas: "Bhūr Bhuvah Svah, who will chant this? He will chant this."
1.327.5	Prajapati is indeed "Ka."
1.327.6	He chooses him alone for the priestly duties at the beginning.
1.327.7	Whatever he chants, it becomes done by speech.
1.327.8	He becomes debt-free in his own self.
1.327.9	Then he recites:
1.327.10	Breath is indeed peace.
1.327.11	Agni is indeed the Brihat and Rathantara.
1.327.12	He pacifies them with breath.
1.327.13	And those who sing the Brihat and the Rathantara in an unpacified manner, those young Brahmins perish themselves.
1.328.1	Just as one would take a hot iron with tongs, so he takes it with the Brihat and Rathantara.
1.328.2	They do not harm him.
1.328.3	He who, knowing this, sings the Brihat and the Rathantara, attains the whole span of life.
1.328.4	This (earth) is the Rathantara.
1.328.5	Its calf is that which shines.
1.328.6	When he sings, "Bha! Bha!" he places the sun in his mouth.
1.328.7	Just as a calf would suck its mother, a cow, when she is released, so one who desires to obtain a particular object should sing this song, the Rathantara, in order to obtain it.
1.328.8	The Rathantara is indeed prosperity.
1.328.9	These are its praises, which are on this earth.
1.329.2	From this place of rest they fall away, if they do not praise the imperishable ones.
1.329.3	But he who praises the imperishable ones, he stands firm in his own place of rest.
1.329.4	Therefore one should praise the imperishable.
1.329.5	The singers of the gods, the Kurus and Pancalas, fall away from their place of rest, so says Satyayani.
1.329.6	Mind is the former, and speech is the latter.
1.329.7	Mind is the Brihat, and speech is Rathantara.
1.329.8	When the Brihat and Rathantara came to a race, the Brihat won.
1.329.9	The Rathantara thought it was losing.
1.329.10	When one sings the Rathantara quickly, one makes mind and speech equal.
1.329.11	This Rathantara is seen by him who says, "Let him who has made me equal to this be destroyed. Let him quickly abandon evil."
1.329.12	He who, knowing this, quickly sings the Rathantara, quickly abandons evil.
1.330.1	One should quickly sing it without blowing out the full mouth.
1.330.2	This is the prosperity of the Rathantara.
1.330.3	This is the prosperity that he bestows on himself.
1.330.4	And this Agni is the Rathantara.
1.330.5	Therefore one should quickly set out.
1.330.6	Where Agni, when he is being worshipped, burns, there the plants grow far away.
1.330.7	Where he goes when he is being fanned, there the plants quickly grow.
1.330.8	"Quickly with offspring and cattle, for offspring" - thus one should say in the Pratihara (Sāman).
1.330.9	The Ida is indeed cattle.
1.330.10	The Rathantara is the abode.
1.330.11	He indeed establishes those cattle in the abode.
1.330.12	There they stop with the same form, saying "Bha, Bha".
1.330.13	The sun indeed is Bha.
1.330.14	Śāṭyāyani said, "This is a union of two things that do not reproduce, because they are of one form."
1.330.15	It is the male.
1.330.16	This is the female.
1.330.17	It is the man.
1.330.18	This is a woman.
1.330.19	When it rains, then this (earth) is born.
1.330.20	When a man deposits semen in a woman, then she is born.
1.330.21	Therefore, one should recite the verse "abhabhabhabhabhabha" as a couple for procreation.
1.330.22	As long as one recites, one should have one's hands on the ground to prevent the chariot of the gods from moving away.
1.331.1	One recites sixteen syllables.
1.331.2	The human being has sixteen parts.
1.331.3	One sprinkles the sacrificer in this divine womb with the parts.
1.331.4-10	He is born to this divine lineage, above the gods. The fourteen and the fourteen plus one. Then the ten that are there, that is Viraj. Food is Viraj. Now the four that are there, those are the four-footed animals. He obtains the four-footed cattle. He recites the sixteen-syllabled Stobha.
1.331.11	Then the fifteen which are the five, that is the fifteenfold thunderbolt.
1.331.12	Then the sixteenth syllable is Indra.
1.331.13	Indra is the rising of the thunderbolt, the sixteenth.
1.331.14	That Indra is the sacrificer.
1.331.15	The Udgātṛ, with the sacrificer's fifteenfold thunderbolt, covers the hated evil foe.
1.331.16	The fourteen and the fourteen-and-a-half (sāmans) are (respectively) the fourteenth and the fifteenth.
1.331.17	That is the thunderbolt, the beginning of which is not to be found.
1.331.18	The Udgātṛ recites it for the purpose of destroying the enemy of the sacrificer. He destroys the enemy for the purpose of the enemy.
1.331.19	For him there is no enemy at all, who knows thus.
1.331.20	He recites the sixteen syllables.
1.331.21	The fourteen verses of the Caturdaśa and Caturdaśottara are the same.
1.331.22	These make forty-four syllables.
1.331.23	The Tristubh has forty-four syllables
1.331.24	Indra is the Tristubh.
1.331.25	He, that Indra, was expelled from the middle of the metres, many metres before him and many above him.
1.332.1	All the Stomas, all the animals, all the gods, all the worlds, all the desires are the Chandas.
1.332.2	He obtains all the Stomas, animals, gods, worlds, and desires.
1.332.3	This is Agni, the Rathantara.
1.332.4	Agni is death.
1.332.5	He who stumbles over the syllables other than the Aksaras, he alone is the Udgata, who places the sacrificer in the mouth of Death.
1.332.6	But he who stumbles over Aksaras, stumbling is food; by stumbling he closes the mouth of Death and crosses over that death.
1.332.7	And the Rathantara is indeed the ocean.
1.332.8	Now he who worships outside the syllables enters this ocean.
1.332.9	Now he who worships in the syllables crosses this ocean like one would cross from one island to another by boat or raft.
1.332.10	"He sees heaven." He says this.
1.332.11	When one goes to heaven, then one becomes immortal.
1.332.12	He said to all the gods and all the beings, "This Brahman has gone to heaven and become immortal."
1.332.13	All the gods and all beings know him.
1.333.1	Now this is the Vamadevya.
1.333.2	It is to be sung from the Pratihara onwards.
1.333.3	For Vamadevya is indeed the vital breath.
1.333.4	"Let us not cut off our life-breath."
1.333.5	One should not sing the path of another.
1.333.6	One who sings the path of another, when one is the lord and the supporter of one's own.
1.333.7	One's own path alone should be sung.
1.333.8	Brahmadatta, the son of Chaikitaneya, said: "This is like a hidden treasure, the path of Vamadeva, like a treasure that has been removed.
1.333.9	For these are created from it.
1.333.10	Just as a worn-out leather bag or a horse with a cut rein.
1.333.11	For each back carries its own load.
1.333.12	One should sing the form of the back in that, or one should sing the Vyahrtis, namely, "Cow, horse, calf, sheep, barley, and wheat."
1.333.13	The cow itself is the Rathantara.
1.333.14	The horse is the great one.
1.333.15	The goat is the variegated one.
1.333.16	The sheep is the variegated one
1.333.17	The barley is the Sakvaris.
1.333.18	The wheat is the Revatis.
1.333.19	Those that are created from this juice, he places them in this (earth).
1.333.20	He nourishes it.
1.333.21	By this nourishing and juicy one, he is praised.
1.333.22	If he desires rain, he should recite the Vyāhṛtis beginning with "Water is Vāyu" and then praise with the Vāmadevya hymn.
1.333.23	Then indeed it rains for him.
1.333.24	Vāmadevya is indeed cattle.
1.333.25	He who, knowing this, praises with the Vāamadevya hymn becomes endowed with cattle.
1.333.26	That indeed is well sung in the Brahma Sāman, when he sings it after being composed by the Brahma Loka.
1.333.27	Seven times the Brahma-saman grows.
1.333.28	The seventh is the world of Brahma.
1.333.29	Vasor and Mandano, these four (worlds) are ascended.
1.333.30	Andhasa and Bhi and Vatsan, these three (worlds).
1.333.31	These seven are completed.
1.334.1	The world named Upodaka, in which this Agni (is located).
1.334.2	Rtadhama, in which Vayu (is located).
1.334.3	The sun is in the one called Aparajita.
1.334.4	Varuna is in the one named Adhidyu.
1.334.5	Death is in the one known as Pradyu.
1.334.6	Hunger is in the one where Rochaya is.
1.334.7	The seventh heaven, the world of Brahma, is where this Brahma is.
1.334.8	One should place oneself in the world of Brahma by means of the seventh heaven, the heaven of Vistanpa.
1.334.9	And also the sacrificer.
1.334.10	Then he sends it to him.
1.334.11	Whatever he touches, that he makes prosperous with a dear abode.
1.334.12	When he takes it up with a good mind, he makes it ascend to the world of Brahman with a dear abode, and makes it prosperous.
1.334.13	Then indeed he makes it prosperous with a dear dwelling.
1.334.14	He brings him to this world.
1.334.15	By that he attains the whole span of life.
1.335.1	Now this is the time for the Kalēya.
1.335.2	One should sing as if spreading, as if arranging, as if binding.
1.335.3	Just as one would walk on a path covered with barley or wheat, so did the Brahmanas of the Kurus in ancient times discuss this Kalēya.
1.335.4	It seems to be drawing the song.
1.335.5	Some perform the upward Ida of the Rathantara Sāman with the words, "Oyiḍa of the Nākarin."
1.335.6	Śāṭyāyanī said, "This Ida seems to be agitated and fallen.
1.335.7	One who is going to perform the Iḍā at the end should recite the Dhura verse for the second Stotriya of the Brhat Sāman.
1.335.8	They do not go beyond the form of the Brhat.
1.335.9	Some indeed perform the Iḍa at the end of the Rathantara and Brhat Sāmans, saying, "This Iḍa is not burnt, it is heavenly."
1.335.10	He said, "Agni is the Rathantara.
1.335.11	Vayu is the Vamadevya.
1.335.12	Indra is the Naudasa.
1.335.13	The Visve Devas are the Kaleya.
1.335.14	Now this is indeed heaven, and the Visve Devas.
1.335.15	They indeed stand in heaven among the Visve Deva.
1.335.16	He who would recite them in this manner, they would be so.
1.335.17	Therefore, this is the constant and final (rite) for the attainment of all life and the non-destruction of this world.
1.336.1	Now this Brahma is performed at the mouth of the Soma-pressing.
1.336.2	This is self-praised, namely, Brahma.
1.336.3	In that it is praised, this praise is greater when he takes up this 'Om'.
1.336.4	This is the syllable of the sun.
1.336.5	This is the pressed syllable of the three Vedas.
1.336.6	When he takes up 'Om', he places this sun in front of him.
1.336.7	Just as one would mix rice with honey, so does he mix the Saman with the essence through this syllable.
1.336.8	It nourishes it.
1.336.9	Through this nourishing and tasty (syllable) it is praised.
1.336.10	The Kurus say that the Sama falls down when it is being stopped.
1.336.11	When one takes up (the Sama) after the stoppage, it is raised.
1.336.12	The Sama is indeed sung all around.
1.336.13	That is well sung.
1.336.14	If one sings the Sama, one should know that one is singing the Sama all around. One should know that one will go to the highest state by this.
1.337.1	Then these two, the Uṣṇīka and Kakubha, are to be sung from the end of the Pratihara.
1.337.2	This metre is indeed like a heap of straw.
1.337.3	The Uṣṇīka and Kakubha are the desires of men.
1.337.4	Then Śamāstomi Bālāki, while making his student Jānasruti's son sing at his own sacrifice, made him recite the Sāman.
1.337.5	"So it is that this Jānasruti will become a Sama-singer, as if his blood will flow now."
1.337.6	Then the students of Ajīnavāsin, while fighting, entered the assembly.
1.337.7	Then his staff fell and caused blood to flow.
1.337.8	He said, "How should one sing?"
1.337.9	He said to him, "One should not sing 'blood' at all.
1.337.10	One should sing 'Ho' only.
1.337.11	One should not sing the entire third pressing in a hidden manner.
1.337.12	He who would say to him, "You are covering yourself," he would be right.
1.337.13	He should illuminate the Dṛṃhī.
1.337.14	They praise the Dṛṃhi.
1.337.15	And this is the Śyāvāśva.
1.337.16	They sing, "Come here, come here."
1.337.17	This is speech.
1.337.18	Speech is the Anushtubh.
1.337.19	"This is to be said by speech. We shall stand by speech."
1.337.20	Thus he sang, and Gaduna, the son of Chekitana, the son of Brahmadatt, the son of Arshaka, repeated it.
1.337.21	"Thus indeed did Dalbhya make Shava-ashva go, so that he would ascend to heaven and be free from sin."
1.337.22	Then the other one, having understood, said, "So it is. He will sing to Vamadeva in such a way that he will wander like a barren animal."
1.337.23	Then there was Brahmadattā, the daughter of Chekitāna, and Brahmadattā was the daughter of Prāse-najit.
1.338.1	King Kauśalya had her as his queen.
1.338.2	Her son spoke to her, "You are Prachya."
1.338.3	She replied, "This is a mistake.
1.338.4	It is proper that I should go again."
1.338.5	He went.
1.338.6	Then his kinsmen, the Jaimāvas, brought him from Vāluṇā.
1.338.7	He came to their assembly.
1.338.8	He rose up from the grass.
1.338.9	He used to fly before.
1.338.10	He harassed him by giving him much.
1.338.11	They met.
1.338.12	He said, "If this had happened,
1.338.13	Come, let us recite this together."
1.338.14	He said, "Gaduna, Shavasva, the son of Archanas, having left the deceased Parasharins, went to heaven.
1.338.15	He was called by Shavasva himself, saying, 'Come, come!'
1.338.16	He who is born in the same family is indeed inferior.
1.338.17-21	When he sings, "O Ho, come hither!" he makes him ascend with his own sin. To him he said, "One should sing only, 'O Ho, come!' O Ho is indeed Indra. He who shines yonder is indeed Indra. He is the same as the one to whom all the gods are obedient.
1.338.22	All those who know this sing the Śyāvāśva hymn.
1.339.1	This is the Āndhīgaṅga hymn, with the middle verse as the concluding verse, for stability.
1.339.2	Whatever is defective, ill-sung, ill-recited, or incomplete in this sacrifice, that is made up by this (hymn).
1.339.3	This (hymn) has five verses, which grow five times.
1.339.4	The Paṅkti metre has five feet.
1.339.5	The Paṅktis are the animals.
1.339.6	The animals are the Jagatī.
1.339.7	He distributes these animals among the animals.
1.339.8	This is the animal-like (verse), so says Sucitta Sailna.
1.339.9	He becomes possessed of animals, his lineage is not cut off, he who knowing thus sings the Kavya.
1.339.10	This is what is called the Tanti (verse).
1.339.11	Now, the pervasion of the world of heaven.
1.339.12	This is indeed the Gāyatrī.
1.339.13	The Tristubh is the atmosphere.
1.339.14	The Jagatī is the sky.
1.339.15	By means of the third growth, one ascends to the world of heaven
1.339.16	That is the one leading to cattle and heaven, so it is said.
1.339.17	One attains both these desires.
1.340.1	He who knows the essence of the sacrifice, milks the offered sacrifice.
1.340.2	The Yajñāyajñiya is indeed the beginning of the sacrifice.
1.340.3	Its two breasts are the Gāyatrī, the Rathantara, the Brhat and the Vāmadevya.
1.340.4	One should recite it like the Gāyatrīs.
1.340.5	One should chant the stobhas like the Rathantara.
1.340.6	One should ascend the rohas like the Brhat.
1.340.7	The Vāmadevyā is the hinkāra.
1.340.8	The Yajñāyājñiya is itself.
1.340.9	This indeed is the sacrifice that the sacrificer milks.
1.340.10	He becomes better by milking it.
1.340.11	It grows ten times.
1.340.12	Six times for the former two.
1.340.13	Four times for the last one.
1.340.14	These ten growths are accomplished.
1.340.15	The Viraj has ten syllables.
1.340.16	Food is Viraj.
1.340.17	This very one who shines is Viraj.
1.340.18	In this very world, they finally attain heaven.
1.340.19	One should sing the Utkhas as if they were mixed with Channas.
1.340.20	For the Utkhas are of the day.
1.340.21	One should then sing the night as if it were revealed.
1.340.22	For the night is as if hidden.
1.340.23	They say, "O Udgatar, you have made the day into night and the night into day."
1.340.24	He should say, "Both." "I spent the day in the day, and the night in the night."
1.340.25	The day is indeed manifest.
1.340.26	In that he sings what is hidden in it, he establishes it as a pair, as procreation.
1.340.27	The night is indeed hidden.
1.340.28	In that one sings it when it is manifest, it is like placing light in darkness.
1.340.29	Therefore one should sing the day in the form of night and the night in the form of day.
1.341.1	That is the very well-sung.
1.341.2	Then indeed, he sings the day and the night in each other, establishing them in each other.
1.341.3	What is the day, that is hidden, he sings. Therefore this sun does not burn everything.
1.341.4	Now, when he sings that night which is hidden, it is known. Therefore, whatever is known at night.
1.341.5	If he were to sing that night which is concealed, it would be darkness indeed.
1.341.6	Now, the Agniṣṭoma Sāmans of the kings.
1.341.7	The twelve-fold Sāmans of princes.
1.341.8	The Sāmans of Chandaśa of the commoners.
1.341.9	Therefore these three Sāmans should be performed in the year.
1.341.10	Whatever is like a Kshatra, like a Vid, like a prince, that is prosperous.
1.341.11	As it would be like a Kshattra, like a Vid and like a prince, so it is.
1.341.12	Now, since these Sāmans are performed in the year, then the singing of the Agniṣṭoma Sāmans.
1.341.13	Just as the king's personal belongings are a blanket, a deer-skin, a gem, gold, an elephant, a coin, a horse, a chariot, a horse-drawn chariot, a golden vessel, and a pot, so these are the personal belongings of these Sāmans.
1.341.14	Therefore, having made the Agniṣṭoma Sāman the principal one, one should sing the others as they are sung.
1.342.1	If the two Soma-pressings were to be performed, one should perform the Prātaranuvāka at the Mahāratra.
1.342.2	One who is first, first takes up speech, first takes up the deities, first takes up metres.
1.342.3	All the deities are metres.
1.342.4	All deities of them are taken up.
1.342.5	One who wishes to take up the Vasatīvarī waters should be first.
1.342.6	The Vasatīvarīs are all deities.
1.342.7	All the deities of these (sacrifices) are worshipped.
1.342.8	One should offer at Susamiddha.
1.342.9	Agni is all the deities.
1.342.10	All the deities see and worship them. For the sake of supremacy over the metres.
1.342.11	One should make offerings at the Agnidhra.
1.342.12	One should perform the morning Savana offering with the formula, "For lying down, for sitting down, for the Gāyatrī metre, for supremacy, svāhā."
1.342.13-16	At the midday pressing, he should offer with the formula, "For lying down and sitting down, for the Tristubh metre, for supremacy, svāhā." At the third pressing, he should make the offering with the formula, “For lying down and for sitting down, for Jagati metre, for supremacy svāhā." The gods conquered the Asuras with the metres. Those who press together are indeed like enemies.
1.342.17	They conquer them by means of the metres.
1.342.18	One should offer oblations with the Rg verses of Prajapati.
1.342.19	Prajapati is all the deities.
1.342.20	All the deities of them are obtained.
1.343.1	If they desire, "May the Adhvaryu of them die," they should tell the Adhvaryus at the morning pressing, "Offer oblations with the verses of Prajapatı."
1.343.2	If they wish, "May the Hotṛ of these die," they should say to the Hotṛ at the midday pressing, "Offer oblations with the Rg verses of Prajapati."
1.343.3	If they wish, "The Udgātṛ of these may die," they should tell the Udgātṛ at the third pressing, "Offer the oblations with the verses of Prajapāti."
1.343.4	Thus the officiating priests are arranged.
1.343.5	The Adhvaryu is the first to be yoked.
1.343.6	His place is the morning pressing.
1.343.7	Then the Hotri.
1.343.8	His place the midday pressing.
1.343.9	Then Udgata.
1.343.10	His place, the third pressing.
1.343.11	They yoke them in their own places.
1.343.12	If they wish that the sacrificer should die, they should say to the sacrificer, "Offer with the verses of Prajapati."
1.343.13	If they wish that all should die, they all should offer at all the Savanas.
1.343.14	Both the Brihat and Rathantara are performed.
1.343.15	These are Indra's two horses, namely the Brihat and the Rathantara.
1.343.16	The sacrifice is the divine chariot.
1.343.17	With Indra's own chariot, with the sacrifice, he conquers the race.
1.343.18	This is the Rathantara.
1.343.19	That is the Brihat.
1.343.20	From this, from that, from today, from tomorrow, from the pair, they enter between.
1.344.1	The ghee offering is dedicated to Agni: "May your blessings come to us."
1.344.2	It is the form of the gods, for supremacy. The form.
1.344.3	They become (the gods) themselves.
1.344.4	The hymns Abhi, Abhi, Abhi, and Abhi are the hymns that are sung. They are for supremacy.
1.344.5	They become (the gods themselves).
1.344.6	The hymns Vihavyam, Sajaniyam, Agastya, and Kayashubhiyam are the hymns that belong to the gods.
1.344.7	Then, by means of the oblation, they invite Indra, the deity.
1.344.8	They bind him with the same kind.
1.344.9	Agastya was followed by the demons.
1.344.10	He desired, "May I kill the demons."
1.344.11	He saw this weapon called Káyasúbhi.
1.344.12	With it he killed the demons.
1.344.13	They (the gods) protect those who offer the Soma-pressings, as if they were their own.
1.344.14	The weapon which is made of Kyaśubhi wood is for the removal of the Rākṣasas.
1.344.15	If the others were to perform the Agniṣṭoma, then they should perform the Ukthya for themselves.
1.344.16	If the other were to perform the Ukth ya, then they should take the Sodashin for themselves.
1.344.17	If the others were to perform the Sodashin, then one should perform the Atirātra.
1.344.18	If the others were to perforin the Atirātr, then one should perforin the Dvirātra.
1.344.19	if the others were to perfoim the Dvirātr, then oue should perform the Trirātra.
1.344.20	May the praises be greater, may the hymns be greater, may more deities be invoked for the sake of supremacy.
1.344.21	They indeed become superior to them.
1.344.22	Just as when two armies are about to fight, the soldiers come in greater numbers, so is it.
1.344.23	They say, "One should first mentally conceive this sacrifice."
1.344.24	He should conquer him alone.
1.344.25	He who of two fleeing together reaches the wood first, he alone wins.
1.344.26	He alone should be desirous of the position.
1.345.1	If one among the initiated dies, they should cremate him, put the bones in a bag, divide the Soma and consecrate and sacrifice with the one who is the most deserving among them.
1.345.2	They undertake the consecration for the same sacrifice, for the same good deed.
1.345.3	They appease him with that alone.
1.345.4	They should do something else.
1.345.5	Having offered Soma and taken up the Grahas, if they were to place the Dakṣiṇās, the Sṛktis, in a different place and praise the Marjālīya,
1.345.6	they praise with the Arbudas.
1.345.7	The serpent is the Arvuda.
1.345.8	They remove the skin of the dead with these (verses).
1.345.9	Those who do for the dead are as if dying.
1.345.10	They remove with these (verses) the skin of the one who is dead.
1.345.11	They praise in three (verses).
1.345.12	The world of the fathers is the third from here.
1.345.13	They send him to the world of the fathers.
1.345.14	They praise the verses in the reverse order.
1.345.15	They thus send him to the other world.
1.345.16	The Yama-sāman is sung.
1.345.17	They thus send him to Yama's world.
1.345.18	The Aprastuta and Apraitirita Sāmans are sung.
1.345.19	The sacrificer is held by the Prāstara and Pratihāra.
1.345.20	Therefore, when the Aprastuta and the Apraitirita are sung, they establish him in the other world.
1.345.21	The Rishis praise him, reciting the verses, touching the right thighs.
1.345.22	They go around three times, touching the right thigh.
1.345.23	They thus throw him into that world.
1.345.24	The wind blows over him in that world.
1.345.25	They say, "Those who perform the rites for the dead go away from the path."
1.346.1	They take up the cups beginning with Indra-Vayu.
1.346.2	They return to the path.
1.346.3	The entire praise is uneven.
1.346.4	For this world is uneven.
1.346.5	By this they attain that world.
1.346.6-11	They say, the Pavamāna verses should be in the Trivṛt metre. The subsequent Stotras should be in the Saptadaśa metre. The Trivṛt is the vital airs. Those who perform for the dead are deprived of the vital airs. Therefore, if the Pavamāna hymns are in the Trivrt metre, they are indeed endowed with the vital airs. The subsequent Stotras are in the Saptadaša metre.
1.346.12	Prajapati is the seventeenth.
1.346.13	Prajapati is the guide to the heavenly world.
1.346.14	He who is the guide to heaven, may he lead me to heaven.
1.346.15	The other Pavamana verses should be seventeen in number.
1.346.16	The northern Stotras should be three-fold.
1.346.17	They reach the mouth of the one who is the guide.
1.346.18-22	Thus one should recite the first verse, for it is thus that one goes beyond. That is how it is. The three verses beginning with 'Trivrit' are the northern ones. The three are the vital airs. They go beyond the vital airs. They say that those who perform for the dead are indeed successful in the vital airs.
1.347.1	They take up the Maitrāvaruṇa and other Grahas.
1.347.2	Praṇā and Apānā are Mitra and Varuna.
1.347.3	They prosper through Praṇā and Apāna.
1.347.4	They say, "One should not offer the Yajya before a year."
1.347.5	If one were to offer the Yajyas before a year, one would incur harsh speech and injury.
1.347.6	The oblations are to be offered in the latter half of the year.
1.347.7	"They say, "We shall not be affected by the harsh speech."
1.347.8	Some say that they should offer the oblations in the latter half.
1.347.9	For their union and separation are equal.
1.347.10	Those who are liberated from this world, they are liberated from that world.
1.348.1	If the Sāman priests were to rise from the Sāman sacrifice, they should offer a sacrifice with the Viśvajit Atiratra, with all the Prstha and all the Veda.
1.348.2	The Prstha are the seasons.
1.348.3	The seasons are the year.
1.348.4	By that, they attain the year.
1.348.5	And the Dakṣiṇās that are given, they use them for the Atigrahya.
1.348.6	Now they say, they should offer with the same Vaisvānara Prāyaniya Atiratra.
1.348.7	When the day and night are changing, they attain the year.
1.348.8	By that they attain the year for them.
1.348.9	And whatever Dakṣiṇās they give, they use them for excess.
1.348.10	If there is a break in the chanting of the Hotr in one section, they should chant fifteen verses for the Hotr and five each for the others.
1.348.11	If there is a break between the chanting of the Hotṛ and Maitrāvaruṇa in two sections, they should chant for the Hotṛ and the Maitrāvaruṇa first and for the Brahman and the Acchāvāka later.
1.348.12	If all the verses are recited in all the recitations, then the Hotr should recite six verses, and the others should recite three verses each.
1.348.13	All of them should do something different from this.
1.348.14	Having approached the eleven verses of the Ekarchas, the twelfth verse is the entire Trishtup.
1.348.15	Thus did Maungi Sahashravasa do.
1.349.1	Then indeed the Kapivana Bauvaayana said to him, "He has gone away like a cowherd with his cows.
1.349.2	His subjects will be intoxicated.
1.349.3	But she will be endowed with brahminical splendour."
1.349.4	He said, "He who will address me." Having approached these twelve Ekacaras, he praised the Rāthantara Sāman in the third verse, "O Agni, O Vivasvat, O Uṣas."
1.349.5	By saying "Agni," he avoided the form of Agni.
1.349.6	By saying "Uṣas," he avoided the Uṣas.
1.349.7	By saying, "Together with the Asvins," he avoided the Asvins.
1.349.8	His progeny would not have been intoxicated.
1.349.9	It would have been endowed with brahminical splendour.
1.349.10	He said to him, "Even when you are bathing, they should call you like this."
1.349.11	He said, "That is not said."
1.349.12	Some of them even hid themselves when the sun had risen.
1.349.13	They, having met together during the next night, praised her, saying, "This indeed is the one who has gone away from us."
1.349.14	They were pleased.
1.349.15	Those who know this and act accordingly, they indeed succeed.
1.350.1	If Soma were to be left over after the morning pressing, they should chant the verse "The cow gives milk to the Maruts" before the Pavamāna of the midday pressing.
1.350.2-8	They praise in the Gāyatrī verses. For the Soma indeed exceeds the Gāyatrīs. They praise in the Marutvatī verses. For indeed the Soma exceeds the Marutvatīs. They prasie in the Dhayyadvatī verses. The cows indeed suck the Maruts. The praise is as long as the stotra of the Yāvadājyas.
1.350.9	What is in excess of that, they imagine.
1.350.10	If the Soma were to be in excess of the midday pressing, they would chant the verse "You are a great one for the sun" before the Pavamāna hymn of the Ārbhava pressing.
1.350.11	They chant in the Brihatī verses.
1.350.12	Because the Soma is in excess of the pressing belonging to the Brihatī.
1.350.13	They chant the Sauri verses.
1.350.14	The Soma-pressing exceeds the Sūrya-pressing.
1.350.15	The Stotra is as long as the Prstha-s.
1.350.16	They make up for whatever is exceeded.
1.350.17	If the Soma exceeds the third pressing, they should perform the Ukthya.
1.350.18	If the Ukthya exceeds, they should take up the Sodashin.
1.350.19	If the Sodashin is exceeded, they should perform the Atiratra.
1.350.20	Indeed, the night is not exceeded by one's own desire.
1.350.21	One desiring cattle should exceed cattle.
1.350.22	One desiring animals should exceed animals of a Vaishya.
1.350.23	They praise in the Tristubh metre, with the Brihat melody.
1.350.24	The Tristubh is indeed the Kshatriya.
1.350.25	The Kshatriya indeed is the giver of animals.
1.350.26	He who is the giver of animals, may he give us animals.
1.351.1	They know the excess.
1.351.2	Then he should say, "Let there be the Anuvṣṭakāra."
1.351.3	Having offered them all together and having sprinkled, one should offer at the Anuvṣṣṭakāra.
1.351.4	If there is indeed more than that, one should stand with the pot itself.
1.351.5	If the king were to rain down, if the moon were to descend, then of that Indra, the lord of Indra, the sweet-speaking, the discerning, the invited, I eat the invited portion, may the tongue, rejoicing, be satisfied with Soma.
1.351.6	They say: "All the nectar, all the food and drink, comes to this world in the form of water.
1.351.7	He should think that the entire Veda is indeed the food of immortality, and that it has come to this world.
1.351.8	That itself is the atonement there.
1.351.9	If they were to cover the vessel, he should sit with the upper part of the garment covering it.
1.351.10	The king indeed becomes united with the verse.
1.351.11	The Adhvaryu should scatter it and take it away.
1.351.12	If it is to be wiped, then the one who is now on the sacrificial post should be removed from the sacrificial post and given to him.
1.351.13	Having wiped him, they should make the other goblets in the same way.
1.351.14	That itself is the atonement there.
1.352.1	If the pot is broken at the morning pressing, they should recite the Brihatī verses addressed to Viṣṇu, "May Viṣṇu fill all of them."
1.352.2	If the pot is broken during the midday pressing, they should chant the Anushtubh verses addressed to Viśvadevī, "Flow, O bestower of strength."
1.352.3	If the pot breaks at the third pressing, they should perform the Ukthya and then perform the Brahma-sāman in the verses "O Indra, O Vishnu, you who are the most powerful..."
1.352.4	The pot breaking is a hole in the sacrifice.
1.352.5	They make it whole again with the sacrifice of Vishnu.
1.352.6	For that is his true form.
1.352.7	The Sāman ends with the Vasat-call.
1.352.8	Both these two are Agni, namely this (earth) and the Vasat-call.
1.352.9	When it is kindled with the Saman, the offering is made.
1.352.10	The Brahma-sāman is the Śrāyanta.
1.352.11	They indeed make it flourish.
1.352.12	They recite the Yajñāyajñiya in the Anushtubh verses.
1.352.13	The Yajñāyājñiya is speech.
1.352.14	The Anushtubh is speech.
1.352.15	By means of speech they indeed make it flourish.
1.352.16	The Vāravantīya is the Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
1.352.17	The Vāravantîya is the power of Indra.
1.352.18	They thus strengthen it with power and vigour.
1.352.19	If one desires to obtain what has been spilled,
1.352.20	or if one desires what is present,
1.352.21	he should say, "Bring another pot."
1.352.22	Having spread the strainer with the mouth facing north, he should then bring the king.
1.352.23	If the Graha of Aggrayaṇa were to spill, one should pour from the same vessel.
1.352.24	If the vessel of the Ekadhana were to spill, then one should pour from it.
1.352.25	One should pour from one or two vessels, as much as one thinks is sufficient.
1.352.26	That itself is the atonement.
1.353.1	If the Dhruva were to spill, having written it down, one should fill it up with what remains pure.
1.353.2	If the Graha of the Aggrayaṇa spills, one should fill up from the others.
1.353.3	The Āgrayaṇa cup is the Self.
1.353.4	The other cups are the vital airs.
1.353.5	The Self arises from the vital airs, or the vital airs from the Self.
1.353.6	This (cup) encompasses all the Soma-pressings for the non-injury of the sacrifice.
1.353.7	If the clarified butter were to flow over, one should fill it up again and take it.
1.353.8	If the dog should lick the oblation, or if it should be spoiled, one should take it to the north of the altar, sprinkle it, and take another ladle.
1.353.9	If they were to pour the Nārāśaṃsa-offering into a filled vessel, it would not be offered for eating, nor eaten for offering.
1.353.10	One should take it between the enclosing sticks and the ashes.
1.353.11	Some offer the Soma with the formula, "Indra and Agni drink the Soma, offered and unoffered, drunk and undrunk, the pressed Soma, svāhā."
1.353.12	Sāṭyāyanī said that one should offer silently.
1.353.13	Having cleansed the goblet, one should desire the cup with which the Adhvaryu would proceed.
1.353.14	They place the cup of Soma near the person whose life they wish to prolong.
1.353.15	Soma is the life.
1.353.16	They prolong his life by means of Soma.
1.353.17	If they were to carry it around, one should say, "Place it back." Then they should carry it around again.
1.353.18	If they sing, they should cut off the singing.
1.353.19	If they were to eat it, he should desire to be invited.
1.353.20	If he were to go outside the altar and set, or if they were to announce it to the householder, he should desire an invitation.
1.353.21	Prajapati is the householder.
1.353.22	He invites him with Prajapati.
1.353.23	If the stone were to break, they should chant with the Brahma-saman of Dyutana Maruta.
1.354.4	If they steal what has been bought, they should be made to pay the price of whatever they have stolen.
1.354.5	He is bought by the same price as was paid for him before.
1.354.6	But to the seller of Soma, one should give something, saying, "Do not let our Soma-pressing be spoiled."
1.354.7	If they do not find it, they should sprinkle the wool of the babhru and phalguna sheep.
1.354.8	Indra killed Vritra with the thunderbolt.
1.354.9	From that, Soma flowed out, and those became the wool of the black and red sheep.
1.354.10	And those are the red wool that came out from the womb.
1.354.11-16	Therefore, the barley grains are more fit for being offered. They say that it is not fit for being offered because it is not offered. It was in the Asuras that this (grain) was first. The gods made it their own by offering. Therefore, it is only fit for being offered.
1.354.17	Indra, thinking that he had killed Vritra with the thunderbolt, entered the Utikas.
1.354.18	They found him there.
1.354.19	The prosperity of him whose king is taken away is destroyed.
1.354.20	They find prosperity for him.
1.354.21	Where the head of the sacrifice was cut off, its juice flowed and became the Utikas.
1.354.22	They directly consecrate that sacrifice with the Utikas.
1.354.23	If they do not find it,
1.355.1	they should consecrate with white grass.
1.355.2	When King Soma came to this world, he stayed in the Shadas.
1.355.3	That is his own place.
1.355.4	They consecrate him with that.
1.355.5	If they do not find it, they should sprinkle the leaves.
1.355.6	When Suparna brought down Soma, the king, his leaves fell down and became the leaves.
1.355.7	That is his own leaf.
1.355.8	They sprinkle it.
1.355.9	If they do not find that, they should sprinkle whatever herbs.
1.355.10	Soma, the king, was brought by Suparna. When he broke it, the drops that fell down became these very plants.
1.355.11	All plants are indeed Soma-related.
1.355.12	That is his own part.
1.355.13	They indeed consecrate him with that.
1.355.14	One should offer cooked rice at the morning pressing, curds at the midday pressing, and milk at the third pressing.
1.355.15	They actually consume that Soma, namely, the milk.
1.355.16	For that is the juice of plants.
1.355.17	One should give five Dakṣiṇās.
1.355.18	The sacrifice is fivefold.
1.355.19	They find support in the extent of the sacrifice.
1.355.20	One should re-initiate after rising from the Avabhṛtha.
1.355.21	One should then give what one would have given.
1.355.22	That is the atonement.
1.356.1	What is sung before is sung.
1.356.2	What is oversung or badly sung is sung.
1.356.3	That which is sung now is sung.
1.356.4	If they sing less in the later Stotra, they should sing more in the verses.
1.356.5	They add only what is deficient, for the sake of duality and procreation.
1.356.6	If they were to sing more than the prescribed number of verses in the Stotra, they should sing less or in verses with fewer syllables.
1.356.7	They thus make the deficient equal to the excess or the excess equal to the deficient for the sake of union and procreation.
1.356.8	He who knows this is born through union.
1.356.9	If they were to sing less, they should perform the Agniṣṭoma Sāman with three verses.
1.356.10	Two (sāmans) cover the two gaps of the sacrifice.
1.356.11	One becomes the own abode.
1.356.12	If they were to sing in excess, they should sing the Agniṣṭoma-sāman in the Svarā.
1.356.13	The Svarā is deficient.
1.356.14	They remove excess by singing in excess.
1.356.15	If it is sung with one (sāman), it is the Viraṭ (sāman) with hair.
1.356.16	If with two, they are the breasts.
1.356.17	If with three, it is the milking.
1.356.18	The milker is indeed the third.
1.356.19	The four udders are yours.
1.356.20	The milking with five is yours.
1.356.21	The milker is indeed fifth.
1.356.22	The sixth or seventh is the Atiṣṭhuta.
1.357.1	Then Prajapati generated offspring.
1.357.2	He performed austerities.
1.357.3	He thought, "Let me generate a foundation.
1.357.4	Then those creatures which he will create will have this as their support, and will not wander without support.
1.357.5	He created this world, the world of the atmosphere, and the world of the sky.
1.357.6	Having created these three worlds, he became tired.
1.357.7	He heated them.
1.357.8	From those heated ones, three bright ones emerged: Agni from the earth, Vayu from the atmosphere, and Aditya from the sky.
1.357.9	He again heated those bright ones.
1.357.10	From those heated ones, only three bright ones emerged again: the Rig Veda from Agni, the Yajur Veda from Vayu, and the Sama Veda from Aditya.
1.357.11	He again heated these bright (particles).
1.357.12	From those heated (particles) three bright (particles) came out, namely, Bhuḥ from the Ṛgveda, Bhuvaḥ from the Yajurveda and Svaḥ from the Sāmaveda.
1.357.13	That is the bright (particle) of the three Vedas.
1.357.14	This much is all.
1.357.15	The world of those who know the three Vedas is his world. He who knows this.
1.358.1	Indeed, that Prajapati, having created the sacrifice, ascended upwards.
1.358.2	He said to the gods, "With this three-fold Veda, you should perform the sacrifice."
1.358.3	The gods, performing the sacrifice with this three-fold Vedic knowledge, destroyed sin and attained heaven.
1.358.4	They said, "If we, performing sacrifices with this triad of Vedas, have indeed removed sin and have indeed known the heavenly world,
1.358.5	then how can this sacrifice of ours today be interrupted? With what can we heal it?"
1.358.6	Prajapati said to them, "Whatever lustre, strength and vigour there was in this triad of the Veda, I have taken it away."
1.358.7	He gave them these Vyahrtis, saying, "With these you shall heal him."
1.358.8	If a sacrifice is deficient in the Rik, one should offer on the Garhapatya with the formula, "Bhurbhuvah, svah."
1.358.9-13	That is the atonement there. If it is from the Yajur Veda, then one should offer it in the Agnihotra fire with the mantra "Bhuvah svāhā." That is the atonement there.
1.358.14-17	If, in the case of the animal sacrifice at the Iṣṭi or in the Darsha-Pūrṇamāsa, one says "Bhuvaḥ svāhā" in the Anvāhāryapacana, then one should offer it in the Āhavaniya with "Bhuva, Bhuvaḥ, Svāhā". That itself is the atonement there. If, from something that is not remembered, one says "Where did this come from?" and offers it in the Āhavanīya with "Bhur, Bhuvaḥ Svāhā", then that itself is the atonement for all of it.
1.358.18	Just as a physician would heal a wound by stitching together the torn edges of the wound, so does one who knows this heal all that.
1.358.19	But if one who does not know this performs an expiation, it is like healing a wound by stitching the torn edges of a wound or applying a remedy to a wound.
1.358.20	Therefore one should perform an expiation only if one knows this.
1.358.21	They say, "The office of the Hotṛ is performed by the Rk, that of the Adhvaryu by the Yajus, and that of the Udgātṛ by the Sāman. But by what is the office of the Brahman performed?"
1.358.22	He should say, "By this threefold knowledge."
1.358.23	Therefore one should appoint as Brahman one whom he considers the most learned.
1.358.24	He indeed is Brahman who knows this.
1.359.1	They say that men perform the rites of the former half of the month, and the gods perform the rites of its latter half. But those who perform the Sattra perform the rites of both the former and the latter half of the month. He who performs the rites with only one man is indeed praised.
1.359.2	But what if they are performed by both gods and men?
1.359.3	How is it that they perform the rites together?
1.359.4	He would say, "The men of the eastern quarter increase this world, they nourish this, they generate this."
1.359.5	The sacrificer should know in the eastern quarter, "I increase this world, I nourish this, I generate this."
1.359.6	"I am the follower of the gods."
1.359.7	He who follows the path of the good does not perish.
1.359.8	The gods in the dark fortnight increase this world, they nourish it, they generate it.
1.359.9	The sacrificer should know in the dark fortnight, "I am increasing this world, I am nourishing it, I am generating it."
1.359.10	"I am the follower of men."
1.359.11	He who follows the path of the good does not perish.
1.360.1	Then indeed Bhallābeya said: "The gods, in the dark fortnight, increase this world, they nourish it, they generate it.
1.360.2	Therefore, first the creatures, the cattle, the plants, and the trees wither, and then the better and better ones are produced."
1.360.3	The knower of this said this.
1.360.4	They say that if many sacrificers assemble in a common hall for a Soma-sacrifice, if they think that they are performing a sacrifice with different deities, then they should perform the Soma-sacrifice.
1.360.5	If they think, "We shall perform the sacrifice for the householder," then they are excluded from the sacrifice.
1.360.6	How is it that they do not perform the sacrifice and how is it that they are not excluded?
1.360.7	He should say:
1.361.1	"The breath is indeed the king Soma.
1.361.2	Now, when they pour the Soma-juice with the stones in the Havirdhana (shed), and take up the Soma-juice in different vessels, and offer it in different ways, then they have different offerings.
1.361.3	And because this one deity, though one, is established in different creatures, therefore it is called 'not-mixed'.
1.361.4	He who knows the Sansa (the Sansa-rite) indeed conquers the one who performs the Sansa-rite.
1.361.5	This very one who blows here, he is the Sansa in the Sansa.
1.361.6	For all the gods follow him.
1.361.7	Therefore, in whatever direction he blows, in that direction the plants and trees grow.
1.361.8	He is indeed the waters.
1.361.9	When it rains, then it stands still.
1.361.10	That is the space between them.
1.361.11	That is that river which breaks through the mountains and becomes unfordable.
1.361.12	Therefore, one who knows this should perform the consecration even in a space.
1.361.13	He indeed overcomes those who are performing the consecration.
1.361.14	He should approach that deity with the words, "You are auspicious. I approach you. Obeisance to you. Do not harm me. May he who hates me meet with calamity."
1.361.15	He who hates one who knows this meets with calamity.
1.362.1	They say, "How many times does one enter when sprinkled?"
1.362.2	One should say, "Four times."
1.362.3	When one is sprinkled, he enters four ways: Indra by strength, the Maruts by breath, Brihaspati by brilliance, Agni by all the rest.
1.362.4	Then the Soma-juice remains.
1.362.5	This is its atonement.
1.362.6	Having kindled the fire at night on the new-moon day, having spread it and sprinkled it, one should offer these two oblations.
1.362.7	"I am scattered by desire, I am scattered by desire. To desire, svāhā."
1.362.8	"I am afflicted by desire, I have been afflicted by desire. To the one who is afflicted by desire, svāha."
1.362.9	Having made the gesture of salutation, one should stand three times.
1.362.10	May the Maruts sprinkle me, may Indra, may Brihaspati, may Agni sprinkle me with life and strength. May he make my life long.
1.362.11	When he says, "May the Maruts sprinkle," they indeed give him back his life. He who knows this.
1.362.12-14	When he says, "Indra is united," Indra himself gives him strength again. He who knows this, to him. When he says, "Brihaspati is united," Brihaspati himself gives him brahmic glory. He who knows thus, to him. When he says, “Agni is united,” Agni himself unites him with all the other (gods). With which one is scattered, one perishes.
1.362.15	He recites it three times.
1.362.16	These are the three worlds.
1.362.17	He attains these three worlds, and having attained the entire life, he goes to the world of heaven after destroying sin.
1.363.1	Now, indeed, the Nimisha-sattriṇas, the householders with pillars, performed a sacrifice.
1.363.2	Then Mahendra, wishing to diminish them, broke the sacrificial cake in the form of a monkey.
1.363.3	Then indeed, Shitibahu, having been appointed as the Adhvaryu, was the Udgātṛ.
1.363.4	He indeed made that bright essence, the firm knowledge of the three Vedas, and the atonement for all, with these Vyāhṛtis: "Bhūr Bhuvah Svaḥ".
1.363.5	These are the Vyāhrtis, the expiations for all sins.
1.363.6	Just as the ocean is endless, boundless, inexhaustible, so also these Vyāhrtis are inexhaustible.
1.364.1	They are inexhaustible, endless, boundless.
1.364.2	What is called Bhuḥ, that is this world.
1.364.3	What is Bhuvaḥ, that is the sky.
1.364.4	The world of heaven is what is meant by 'heaven'.
1.364.5	These are the Vyāhṛtis, these are the deities.
1.364.6	These are the deities, these are the Vyāhritis. Thus did Shiti-bāhu, the knower of this, the performer of good deeds, the Nimisha-born, the son of Markaṭa, eat the cake.
1.364.7	He said, 'Having taken four spoonfuls of clarified butter, I shall offer it either to Va or to Ju.'
1.364.8	He said, "If you know thus and thus, then you should tell me. The monkey will break the cake. What is the atonement for that?"
1.364.9	He said, "I will be more powerful if I tell you. I am offering the atonement for what is not known. Do you bring it or not?"
1.364.10	He said (to the monkey), "Bring it." He said, "Do not do it."
1.364.11	He indeed obtained it.
1.364.12	He whose learned Brahman is thus, the sacrifice becomes sloping towards the south and towards the east.
1.364.13	The sacrifice becomes sloping towards south and towards the East, and is completed, for him whose learned Brahman is so, and for him who knows it thus, and for him also who knows it thus.
2.1.1	This is the speech, namely, the Prstha (hymns).
2.1.2	They join this speech.
2.1.3	They dwell in that.
2.1.4	Having reached the first day, it becomes Rathantara.
2.1.5	This very earth.
2.1.6	Speech is Rathantara.
2.1.7	She speaks this.
2.1.8	Having reached second day, it becomes Brihatī. She speaks this best speech, it is said.
2.1.9	It is heard from afar.
2.1.10	Having reached the third day, she becomes Vairapa (one who is deformed), as when one says, "Speak sideways, come, bring, bring up, lie down, drink."
2.1.11	Having reached the fourth day, she becomes Virada (one who is expanded).
2.1.12	Sitting silently.
2.1.13	This is the Vairajya of speech, that which is silent. Those who are the best of men seek to know that which is silent, even while sitting.
2.1.14	It becomes Shakarī on reaching the fifth day, by which one is able to give.
2.1.15	It becomes Revatī on reaching the sixth day, by which food is given.
2.1.16	It should not be taken every month.
2.1.17	This is the origin of the Lelebi. They say that this is the speech of the Lelebis.
2.1.18	He spoke this, the previous day, the previous evening.
2.1.19	He speaks the same speech, he does not go around it.
2.1.20	Thus, when they perform the Prsthastomas in each month.
2.2.1	Then, having remained silent, he should speak whatever is good and meritorious.
2.2.2	She spoke what was spoken, saying, "The speaker has spoken."
2.2.3	Thus, the rites of the upper half of the year are performed.
2.2.4	He cries out with Rathantara, he sprinkles the semen with Brihat, he places the embryos with Vaivāhika, he generates with Vairāja, he nourishes with Śakvarī, he gives the food with Revati.
2.2.5	Where will he be born in each month?
2.2.6	The embryo which is aborted in a month, they say, is a miscarriage.
2.2.7	Just as the embryos of a pregnant woman would fall, or as the plants of the spring season would wither, so would it be if the Prsthas were performed every month.
2.3.1	Now, if one were to conceive a child after a year, and if the plants were ripe at the time of conception, they would have gathered them and would have had their desires fulfilled. Thus, when they perform the Prishtha rites after a year.
2.3.2	Now, Chitra Gangayani said, "This is a very productive cow, which gives milk in many ways, because of the Prishtha (rites)."
2.3.3	Who will be the sustainer of the pulsations?
2.3.4	These are not to be milked when not stretched out, nor are they to be milked above when stretched out. The ten nights are milked by the Gāyatrī.
2.3.5	Just as a cowherd would milk the cows with the ropes attached to them, so he milks these (cows) from above, after having been milked for ten nights in the Gayatri metre.
2.3.6	Just as one would milk after having approached, so it is the Gayatri-faced Tri-day; just as one would milk having taken away, so it is Gayatri-middle; just as one should milk having taken away and then milk, so it is that which is Gayatri-final.
2.3.7	Therefore, it is said to be above.
2.3.8	Now Shaatyaayana said, "This moon indeed is the year, this is indeed Prajapati, this is the month."
2.3.9	This is indeed as much as the month is.
2.3.10	Having attained this, he again moves.
2.3.11	He goes upwards for fifteen nights and downwards for fifteen.
2.3.12-16	Those that are filled go upward, and those that are drained go downward. He who is filled goes to this world. He touches food with this world. What he eats there, that is called "sweet." He who is drained comes to this world. He enters these plants.
2.3.17	Having entered these plants, he places himself in the waters and plants, and being filled, he goes to this world.
2.4.1	Thus, returning again, he attains the year.
2.4.2	He who knowing thus, performs the Prsthas in each month, attains in one year what others attain in twelve years.
2.4.3	They perform these four Abhiplvas.
2.4.4	They have twenty-four nights.
2.4.5	The year has twenty-four half-months.
2.4.6	Thus, in the course of a year, they obtain the seasons.
2.4.7	They perform the Pañcamasamāmnāya.
2.4.8	Thus, in the course, of a year, the Pañcahas are performed in each month.
2.4.9	Then indeed Mahitthi, the son of Saimishi, said: "He who is called Apishtha, Adhuvaka, Ushnisha, and who is the one who encircles each family with his family, he indeed is Apishtha, the one who is without the back, the Ushnisha, who is the one without the back, who is the six-day (rite) without the back.
2.4.10	What is that? They should make the Stotras of the six-day rite without the back.
2.4.11	Having approached the five channels, he approaches the backs from above.
2.5.1	The sun was here at the beginning, where this sacrificial ground is.
2.5.2	He shone upon all this.
2.5.3	The gods were afraid of his burning.
2.5.4	They said, "This one will burn everything.
2.5.5	"We have brought these (objects) upwards."
2.5.6	They brought him up in six months.
2.5.7	They placed him on the equinoctial day of the twenty-first (lunar day).
2.5.8	He shines on the equinoctical day of the twentyfirst.
2.5.9	This is the equinoctiality of both those who are above and those who are below.
2.5.10	Now, because it is the equinox of both, therefore it is called Visuvat.
2.5.11	Just as the spokes of a chariot-wheel are all equal, so are all the worlds here equal.
2.5.12	Some people perform the six-day ritual beyond the equinox.
2.5.13	Just as they perform the ritual before the equinox, so do they perform it beyond.
2.5.14	The heavenly world is indeed far away.
2.5.15	We ascend to that far away heavenly world.
2.5.16	One who goes down is one who goes down to the lower world.
2.5.17	Those who say that it is not so, and those who go down to the lower worlds, they attain those worlds which are below the sun.
2.5.18	Even though they perform for many years, they attain only those (worlds).
2.5.19	But those who perform the six days of the year, both the distant and the near ones, they attain both these worlds, the distant and the nearby ones.
2.6.1	He heated this world from near.
2.6.2	They drove Vayu away from the west.
2.6.3	He appeased him with that.
2.6.4	He indeed bears water.
2.6.5	They appeased him with water.
2.6.6	He shone forth to that yonder world.
2.6.7	And they placed the moon beyond.
2.6.8	He appeased him with it.
2.6.9	Prajapati is the moon.
2.6.10	He appea sed him with Prajapati.
2.6.11	He indeed blows through the three worlds.
2.6.12	The sun moves through three worlds, the stars through three worlds. Therefore they are the smallest, because they are the last. These indeed are the twelve worlds of the gods.
2.6.13	Then as the days, so are the other worlds.
2.6.14	He, knowing this world as his abode, penetrated it with three (worlds).
2.6.15	With the Svarasāmans they placed it below.
2.6.16	He saw that supreme world.
2.6.17	He struck it with three (arrows).
2.6.18	With the Svarasāmas they placed it beyond.
2.6.19	He touched it here.
2.6.20	What he touched, that is the Svaras'svaratva.
2.6.21	There are seventeen Svarasāmans.
2.6.22-26	Food is the seventeenth. They placed him in food and drink. Prajapati is the seventeenth. They placed him in food through Prajapati. He shines here, having been placed in food and drink.
2.6.27	They are the fifty-one Svarasāmans, which are the thirty-one Virajas. There are twenty-five on this side and twenty-five on the other side.
2.6.28	And that which is the fifty-first, in it he is placed in the middle, and shines.
2.6.29	There is no sorrow, no cold, no hunger, no thirst, and there is no return for him.
2.6.30	He who knows this does not hunger, does not thirst, and has no return.
2.7.1	Just as a pot of ghee or honey is carried, suspended from a net, so is he held by these Virāts.
2.7.2	He is held by them from the east and the west.
2.7.3	Some of them perform the Agniṣṭoma rites with the same Svara-sāman, saying, "We are performing the Stotra-Bṛhatī."
2.7.4	Those who have three Agniṣṭomas have thirty-six Stotras.
2.7.5	Twelve for one, twelve for another, and twelve for another, making thirty-six.
2.7.6	The Bṛhatī has thirty-six syllables.
2.7.7	Brihatī is the heavenly world.
2.7.8	It touches this one.
2.7.9	They go to this heavenly world of Brihatī.
2.7.10	They indeed go there, but as if without food.
2.7.11	And why they are Utkhas.
2.7.12	Utkhas are cattle.
2.7.13	Cattle are food.
2.7.14	Just as one would approach a person who is pleased with food, so they approach him with the Udgitha and the Svarasāmans.
2.7.15	And indeed these two are the true deities, namely the Viśvajit and the Abhijit.
2.7.16	The Svarasāmans are indeed food.
2.7.17	Just as one puts food in a pot and then takes it out for the good, so he offers this food to him through the Vīśvajit and Abhijit.
2.7.18	And this is indeed a peace offering.
2.7.19	The Agniṣṭoma Sāman should be sung, the Āgnimārut hymn should be recited, and the Viśvajit should be performed.
2.7.20	Who, having accepted these three fires, would beautify them? He would lie down burnt.
2.7.21	That the Ukthas are in between (the two sets of three fires)
2.7.22	The Ukthas are cattle.
2.7.23	Cattle are food.
2.7.24	They pacified him with food.
2.7.25	Having pacified him with the Arni-medha, they take him up at the end.
2.8.1	Those two are the Visvajit and Abhijit.
2.8.2	The eight verses of the Viraj are completed in thirty-one verses, and another eight.
2.8.3	This world is Abhijit, that one is Visvajit.
2.8.4	The animals are the Svarasama hymns.
2.8.5	When they have sung the Abhijit and then sing the Svarasama, they establish the animals in this world.
2.8.6	Now, when they praise the Svarasāmans after the Viśvajit, then from that bestowal of gifts the cattle live.
2.8.7	Now, of this Vaisuvarta day, there are ten stotras of twenty-five verses and two stotriya verses.
2.8.8	Then those ten stotras of twentv-five verses are the Mahāvrata.
2.8.9	On this day of the equinoctial sun, he performs the Mahāvrata sacrifice.
2.8.10	Now those two Stotriya verses are indeed the sun himself, established on this day.
2.8.11	Now indeed, formerly they used to perform the Mahāvrta sacrifice three times, on the Ārambhaṇīya day, on the equinoctiai day, and on the Mahāvrati day.
2.8.12	Now, of that Ārambhaṇīya (the first) day, there are fourteen Pañcaviṃśa stotras and ten Stotriyas.
2.8.13	Then the fourteen Pañcavimśa stotras are the Mahāvrata.
2.8.14	On that Ārambhaniya day, it is connected with the Mahāvrta.
2.8.15	Then the ten Stotriyas are the ten-syllabled Viraj.
2.8.16	Food is Viraj.
2.8.17	By that very same day one goes to the equinoctial day.
2.8.18	And those two Stotriya verses which exceed the equinoctials, that is indeed food and drink.
2.8.19	For there are two forms of food, what one eats and what one drinks.
2.8.20	Just as one eats and drinks, so do they move on to the Great Vrata day.
2.8.21	They go to that heavenly world.
2.8.22	This is the Great Vrata Day.
2.8.23	This indeed is the heavenly world, the Great Vrata.
2.8.24	He who knows this, his Great Vrata becomes threefold, he goes to the heavenly world.
2.9.1	They say, "They impel him with the bright ones." This is to be done as the first part of this day.
2.9.2	"With the rays, with the hymns," (it is said) for the head. "He is the highest in the worlds," (it is) for the self.
2.9.3	Thus they move with this day.
2.9.4	Then indeed Prajapati
2.9.5	Then indeed he is of all the deities.
2.9.6	That is the day of the fathers, the most fruitful.
2.9.7	Just as a son, having come to his father, would call out to him, so is it.
2.9.8	He indeed becomes of both forms.
2.9.9	"Tam" is indeed the form of the male, "Agruva" is of the female.
2.9.10	Having become both, indeed, Prajapati generated.
2.9.11	They say that the first day of the month is when the sun rises.
2.9.12	But when the conjunction (of the moon) has come, one should do it as 'Flow, O speech, the foremost' (RV 10.190.1).
2.9.13	Mind indeed is Prajapati.
2.9.14	Mind indeed is the foremost of speech.
2.9.15	It seizes him with his own form.
2.9.16	It becomes a pair.
2.9.17	'Flow' is the form of the male, 'speech' is the form for the female.
2.9.18	This pair is generated.
2.9.19	He who knows this is born from the pair.
2.9.20	Therefore, this alone should be done.
2.9.21	"Obeisance to him, sung by men." This is the second verse.
2.9.22	They do not go beyond this day.
2.9.23	"The shining one with lightning." This is the third verse, the actual form of this day.
2.9.24	"They urge him forward, the strong one." The fourth verse is the first day of the month. "Let us not interrupt it."
2.10.1	"The Soma, the old one, and the conqueror." It consists of ten verses.
2.10.2	The sages, desiring prosperity, saw the rising of the agreeable speech.
2.10.3	"May you be favourable to us, may you be favourable to." They praised with this.
2.10.4	Then all of them succeeded.
2.10.5	All succeed who, knowing this, praise with this hymn.
2.10.6	In this (hymn) Shakti said: "O Soma Pavamāna, you are the one who conquers Viraj, the sung, and the eternal. You are the one who is praised, the one who is honored, the one who has great fame. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Hum. Earth."
2.10.7	They say that this is a mere contrivance, like a picture.
2.10.8	It tempts one to greed.
2.10.9	"Oṃ" is the only syllable that is to be sung.
2.10.10	This is indeed all that is imperishable.
2.10.11	Just as palāśa seeds are pierced by a needle, in the same way, these worlds are pierced by this imperishable (syllable).
2.10.12	He flows forth tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold.
2.10.13	Therefore this alone is the imperishable hymn to be sung. Thus there is a repetition.
2.10.14	The repetition is desire. It is not obtained. It is not true.
2.10.15	These become twenty-five hymns.
2.10.16	Prajapati is twenty-five.
2.10.17	The Prajapati-rite is the great vow, and it is performed with its characteristics.
2.11.1	Now, however, it is said that all this should be done in twenty-four days.
2.11.2	They should perform only one Stotra of twenty-five verses.
2.11.3	When they perform everything in twenty-five verses, it is an ascent of one Stotra.
2.11.4	Thus this hymn is not to be recited.
2.11.5	Now Shatayani said, "This is like a sacrifice. If one cuts off the Stotriya hymn of one, or of two, or of three,
2.11.6	one finds the expiation for that, or not. But if one cuts off the hymn of eleven, what is the expiation for it?
2.11.7	What is the expiation?"
2.11.8-13	This day is dedicated to one deity, namely Prajapati. It is by this day that one approaches Prajapati. Therefore this day should be performed entirely as the twenty-five. It has three hundred and sixty Stotriya verses. The three hundred are Viraj. The sixty are Udgas.
2.11.14	Now those two are the two udders of this day for milking.
2.12.1	"He brings the ghee, saying, "May we be well-rested." The ghee is for the Apirya.
2.12.2	Wherever there is ghee for the Apiryas, that is indeed Prajapati.
2.12.3	They please him with that.
2.12.4	" "May we be able to do the lord of the earth." This is for the Maitravaruna.
2.12.5	It is as it is."
2.12.6	The Prajapati-rite is not mentioned.
2.12.7	The Prajapati-day is performed with all the characteristics.
2.12.8	"The Indra-rite is performed with the verse, "I am Indra, O Ojas."
2.12.9	This is the form of the gem.
2.12.10	Therefore they wear a gem, a garland, and a crest in front.
2.12.11	"This is the form, "This is the best in the worlds."
2.12.12	Therefore they stand back from it.
2.12.13	"The great praises are the mountain," for that is the form of elephants.
2.12.14	Therefore they mount it as if from the side.
2.12.15	Those are the great forms that are accomplished.
2.12.16	Prajapati is the great form.
2.12.17	The great vow is Prajapatya, and that is done with its characteristics.
2.12.18	These forms of his are indeed bought, but they stand for him who knows thus.
2.12.19	"This is your mind, O Indra and Agni." It is addressed to Indra and Agni.
2.12.20	"O Indra and Agni, the praiseworthy, from the cloud, like rain from the cloud."
2.12.21	They say that "from the cloud" means "from the womb."
2.12.22	It is from this day that one is born.
2.12.23	Just as these eggs are broken, so they are broken from this day.
2.12.24	Listen to the call of the singer, O Indra and Agni, accept the words of praise.
2.12.25	Be the rulers of the expanding thoughts.
2.12.26	O Indra and Agni, do not lead us to sin or censure.
2.12.27	Do not lead us to ruin.
2.12.28	This is indeed a sacrifice against sin.
2.13.1	The verses of the Madhyandina Pavamana are in the Gayatra metre, and are addressed to Prajapati.
2.13.2	In the Prajapati-day, everything is done with the same characteristics.
2.13.3	In these verses, the Gayatra metre is as described in the Brahmana.
2.13.4	Now the Prajapati Sama is sung in the Amahaiyava Prajapati day.
2.13.5	They make it equal to the day in form.
2.13.6	By means of that prosperity, he becomes prosperous among his own people.
2.13.7	Then the milking and the milker, the milkers of this day.
2.13.8	Then the Hariśrī Nidhana.
2.13.9	Hariśrī is the Nidhana.
2.13.10	By means of this, Indra attained the prosperity of all the gods.
2.13.11	By means means of this, they attain prosperity.
2.13.12	Those ten Stotriyas are completed in the Gāyatrī.
2.13.13	The Viraj has ten syllables.
2.13.14	Food is the Viraj.
2.13.15	The Gayatri is the face of the metres.
2.13.16	They place food for themselves from the face itself.
2.13.17	"The Soma, purifying, is held," the Brihatis have both forms.
2.13.18	This indeed is both the Sāman and the Udyaya.
2.13.19	Therefore they perform this (Sāman) of the Brhat, of the Rathantara.
2.13.20	With the questioner, with the seat, with the ancient, with the firm one.
2.13.21	Drink the Soma, O Indra, thou art placed in the womb of the Richika.
2.13.22	Wherever this Brhat is performed, Indra would not be able to resist it, he would not be able.
2.14.1	Among them, the Raurava is known as the Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
2.14.2	"The Agniṣṭoma sāman is known, lest we should be deprived of it."
2.14.3	Then the Āraṇya flower, the Āraṇyaka is food.
2.14.4	Its flower is what is in the forest.
2.14.5	It grows in the forest, for the securing of food from the forest.
2.14.6	Then the Abhiśaṃsa, for satisfaction.
2.14.7	They indeed satisfy him with this.
2.14.8	Then the Angirasa with twenty-five syllables as the last.
2.14.9	The Angirasas, desiring prosperity, practised austerities.
2.14.10	They saw this Sama.
2.14.11	They praised with it.
2.14.12	Then all of them prospered.
2.14.13	All prosper who, knowing thus, praise with this Sama.
2.14.14	It has twenty-five syllables.
2.14.15	Prajapati is twenty-five.
2.14.16	The great vow is Prajapatya, it is done with its characteristics.
2.14.17	Then the known Brahma-sāman of Naudha.
2.14.18	The known Brahma-saman, lest we should be obstructed.
2.14.19	Then the Prisni. Prisni is food, for the attainment of food.
2.14.20	Then the Rauhinaka.
2.14.21	By this (rite) Prajapati ascended the animals of the one-hoofed kind.
2.14.22	In that he ascended the animals of his own will, therefore the Rauhinaka is called Rauhinaka.
2.14.23	He who knows this ascends the animals of his will.
2.14.24	As these wild animals are, so were these animals of the onehoofed kind at first.
2.14.25	He brought them to the village of Rohini in the form of Kitaki.
2.14.26	It is concluded with thirteen (verses). It is concluded with thirteen for the attainment of the thirteenth month.
2.14.27	It is indeed completed with eighty (verses).
2.14.28	They indeed desire him with this.
2.14.29	Then the food of Dirghasrava. Food indeed is Dirghasrava, for the attainment of food.
2.14.30	Then the Samanta and Samanta-sahasra are sung for the attainment of cattle and progeny.
2.14.31	Then the Yodhajayana, the Triṇidhāna, and the Savanas are performed for the attainment of heaven.
2.14.32	Then the Ushanas, the last Sama, is sung.
2.14.33	With the last Sama, we attain the last heaven.
2.15.1	They say that the Tavashavyas should be sung as the Prstha of this day.
2.15.2	This is his praise, not that he accomplishes two.
2.15.3	They say that it is Vamadevya alone.
2.15.4	For Vamadevya is it.
2.15.5	That indeed is the Vamadevya which is the royal (sutra).
2.15.6	He praises it with the breath.
2.15.7	He praises the Vamadevyas with a verse.
2.15.8	For this is the breath of him who is the breath. They indeed say, "Breath is not."
2.15.9	Just as one would say, "The king is the king," so one would say, "The king is the Vamadevya."
2.15.10	Prajapati is the father, Aditya is the son.
2.15.11	Prajapati the Vamadevyam, Aditya the king.
2.15.12	Therefore he shines more than these two.
2.15.13	For this is the splendor that has been split off from him.
2.15.14	That is completed with eighty.
2.15.15	In each Stotriya, two sets of eighty are completed.
2.15.16	They are completed as fifty-eight.
2.15.17	There are two sets of eighty, day and night.
2.15.18	They make him lie down with them.
2.15.19	They make it lie down with them by these.
2.15.20	Those are the concluding verses.
2.16.1	"Vāg" is the Rathantara.
2.16.2	"Iḍa" is the Vairāja.
2.16.3	That is the Śakvarī and the Revatī.
2.16.4	"Svar" is the Virāj.
2.16.5	"Brihat" is the Brihat.
2.16.6	"Bha" is the sun.
2.16.7	"Bha" is the same as the end of this (hymn).
2.16.8	He who knows this attains the same nature as this (hymn)."
2.16.9	All the verses are recited with this Sāman-ending.
2.16.10	These five verses of twenty-five syllables are obtained when the Sāman-endings are recited.
2.16.11	The Hotṛ recites them with the Sāman.
2.16.12	They say, "One should first attain with the self and then with the head."
2.16.13	The self is first and then the head.
2.16.14	Now, indeed, it is like this: If the five-fold head were to fall down, then it would be like this: If they were to descend from the five-fold self to the three-fold head.
2.16.15	One should proceed with the head itself.
2.16.16	Indeed, all the deities stand ready for the praise, thinking, "He will proceed with me, with me."
2.16.17	If he finds it with his head, then he conquers the deity that is associated with the head.
2.16.18	If he finds it with the wings, then he conqueres the deity that is associaed with the wings.
2.16.19	If he find it with the tail, then he conqures the deity that is assoicated with the tail.
2.16.20	If the deity is the same as the Self, then one attains it.
2.16.21	The other deities are hidden.
2.16.22	All the deities are indeed in the head. These are the Vasus.
2.17.1	These are the Rudras, these are the Adityas, these are the All-gods.
2.17.2	This is this world, this is the sky, this is the other world, these are the directions, this is the ear, this is Rathantara, this is Vamadevya, this is Brihat, this is Yagyaya-jya.
2.17.3	He who undertakes this with his head, undertakes without hindrance all the deities, all these worlds, and all the Sāmans.
2.17.4	If he were to attain it by any other part of the body, then he would attain only that deity which is the means of attaining it.
2.17.5	The other deities would be obstructed.
2.17.6	But when one attains it by the head, then he attains it without obstruction by all the deities.
2.17.7	Now this is dear to the gods, that he enters with his head. May all not be lost to us.
2.18.1	This is the semen that first enters, namely the Gāyatrī.
2.18.2	Then the other limbs are formed.
2.18.3	This is indeed the breath that enters, namely the Gayatri.
2.18.4	Then the others limbs are formed.
2.18.5-9	He creates these vital airs from the sky. The vital air is indeed the Gayatri. The head is the Gayatri. It is the head. The vital airs are indeed the support of the head. Therefore, one should begin with the Trivrit (Stoma), then with the Pañcadaśa (Stoma), and then with the Saptadaśa (Stomas), then with the Ekavimśa (Stotras) in the tail, and then with the Paṃcavimśa (Stotra) in the self.
2.18.10	Those who go beyond that, they go beyond fame, they go beyond prosperity, they go beyond the heavenly world.
2.18.11	And indeed for them this day is praised by those very Stoma-s of the Jyotishtoma, which are auspicious and peaceful.
2.18.12	And indeed these very Stoma- s of the Jyotis toma are the auspicious and peaceful share of these.
2.19.1	This is the entire set of Stotras.
2.19.2	In that he recites all the Stotras with this Sama-nidhana, therefore it is the entire set.
2.19.3	And in that these Stotras of the Jyotishtoma are auspicious, peaceful, and are the final portion, therefore it is all Stotras.
2.19.4	The Trinava and Trayastrimsa Stotras indeed come together with prosperity.
2.19.5	One who knows this is praised by all the verses and by all the Stotras.
2.19.6	Some, having made it the third, praise with this alone, saying, "This is indeed the Sama."
2.19.7	In the other world, their heads and other limbs are not distinguished.
2.20.1	They become like lumps, for they are not well-formed.
2.20.2	As each limb is to be praised.
2.20.3	They indeed become in the world of the Fathers, with limbs and offspring, immortal.
2.20.4	Now some indeed make the sound 'hiṅ' only once on the head, saying, "That is the supreme (part)."
2.20.5	Others three times on the other limbs.
2.20.6	Thus there are thirteen sounds 'hiṅ'.
2.20.7	Thus the thirteenth month is obtained.
2.20.8	But that is not so always.
2.20.9	They make the hissing sound three times on the head and three times on the other limbs.
2.20.10	Thus there are fifteen hissing sounds.
2.20.11	Indra is the fifteenth.
2.20.12	The great vow is Indra's. That is done with the same characteristics.
2.21.1-6	They say that the Brahma-sāman should be sung at this time. But that is only a repetition of the previous view. They say that the Rāthantara and the Śyaita should be sung. But that too is only a repetition. They say the Brihat and the Pañca-nidhana and the Vāmadevya should be sung. But that is only a self-praise.
2.21.7	The Sraayantiya is to be performed. There is nothing that is not mentioned in the Sraayantiya.
2.21.8	The Mahavaishtampana is to be performed
2.21.9	It ends with the direction.
2.21.10	The directions are the back-parts.
2.21.11	This is the eastern direction, the Rathantara; this is the Brihat; this is the Vairama; this is the Vairaja; this is the Mahaanamanii; these are the Revati.
2.21.12	From the directions they take away the food of him who knows thus.
2.21.13	From the directions they take the food of him, who does not know thus.
2.21.14	And all the Sāmans of these (Sāmans) are connected with the Brahman-Sāman.
2.21.15	Therefore this is the Sāman, therefore this day is not interrupted.
2.21.16	That is why it occurs in the Brihatī verses. It is for the sake of transcendence and non-deterioration.
2.22.1	They say that the Agniṣṭoma Sāman should be performed on this day.
2.22.2	This is its praise.
2.22.3	What is excessive, we would cut off, what is inferior, that is the later half.
2.22.4	The Ilandam is to be performed for the Pavamana of the Arbhava. What has been performed should not be obstructed.
2.22.5	The Varavantiya is to be performed.
2.22.6	This is its praise.
2.22.7	But as long as one performs the sacrifice, one desires, one wishes, "May I be better, may I be better."
2.22.8	That is to be done in the Gayatra metre of the Pavamana of the Arbhava (Sutra). What has been uttered should not be obstructed.
2.22.9	They say that whatever speech does not exceed, that is to be done as the Agniṣṭoma Sāman of this day.
2.22.10	The Yajñāyajñiya (Sutra) is what speech does not exceed.
2.22.11	Speech is the Yajñāyājñiya.
2.22.12	How can speech exceed speech?
2.22.13	Therefore, the Agniṣṭoma Sāman should be performed in this Hotr-svaram.
2.22.14	Now they make this (Sāman) of thirty-four syllables in Anushtubh metre.
2.22.15	There are thirty-three deities.
2.22.16	Prajapati is the thirty-fourth.
2.22.17	By this (Sāma) the gods prospered along with Prajapati.
2.22.18	Now, when the sacrifice of the beginning is thirty-three in number, then the deities prosper by it.
2.22.19	And by this (sacrifice) they prosper and rise up with Prajapati.
2.23.1	They say, which deity do those who are initiated sit down with, and which do they rise up with?
2.23.2	He should say, "The gods who are being initiated sit down near Agni and stand up near the sun."
2.23.3	Therefore, they say that those who are initiated should sit down, even if they are lying down or standing up.
2.23.4	For Agni is the best of the gods who are sitting.
2.23.5	For then they belong to Agni.
2.23.6	Therefore, they say that those who have risen are called "Udasthurs". Even if they were to lie down, they would still be called "Udasthur".
2.23.7	For the rising gods, the sun is the best.
2.23.8	Because the gods of that time were connected with the sun.
2.23.9	They say, "Who becomes and rises?"
2.23.10	One should say, "Beings become men and rise as gods."
2.23.11	They go to the womb of Brahman, depositing semen in it, which is the essence of the Rg and Yajus.
2.23.12	They go to Agni, offering oblations to him.
2.23.13	Therefore, at the Upasads of the consecration, they become languid.
2.23.14	Then the semen becomes like a young one.
2.23.15	Therefore, a woman becomes languid when her heart is distressed.
2.23.16	Then the semen becomes like a young one.
2.23.17	They go, listening to them, while praising and chanting them three times.
2.23.18	Therefore, the embryos are born from those who do not eat.
2.24.1	They are born as consisting of Rg, Yajus, Sama, Brahma, gold, and immortality.
2.24.2	He who knows that the Rg, Yajus, Sama, Brahma, and the golden (Sutra) are born from the Rg, his bones become Rg-like.
2.24.3	Having generated them before the year, the Udgata gives them to the Hotra.
2.24.4	The Hotra delivers them with hymns.
2.24.5	That is the reason for the hymns being called hymns.
2.24.6	He instructs them with the Sastras.
2.24.7	That is the reason why they are called weapons.
2.24.8	He raises them with praises.
2.24.9	That is the reason why praises are called praises.
2.24.10	He gives them this divine honey and food with eighty (verses).
2.24.11	He who knows this has honey and food in this world and the next.
2.24.12	With every syllable, he should know all desires.
2.24.13	Therefore, the harvest is in the year itself. It should be said in the year.
2.24.14	Therefore, a Brahmin who is killed does not become non-existent.
2.24.15	Therefore, semen that is deposited does not become non existent.
2.24.16	Therefore, one who knows this does not become non -existent.
2.24.17	The gods, by means of eighty (verses), attained these worlds and these paths.
2.24.18	That is why they are called the 'eighty'.
2.24.19-23	By means of three (verses) they attained this world, by means of three the atmosphere, by means of the three the other world, by means (of verses) of four directions, by means of four the intermediate regions, by means of one the upward (world), by means of twenty-eight (verses) they became free from sin. Nine are the vital airs. One attains the vital airs. He becomes endowed with vital airs. He attains the whole life.
2.24.24	One does not die without desire.
2.25.1	Now this is the royal couch of the Udumbara tree.
2.25.2	Its two front feet are made of Bṛhat and Rathantara, the two rear feet of Vaivāvata and Vaivāvata, the two middle feet of Śākvara and Raivata, the two upper feet of Śākvarī and Raivata. The verses are recited in the eastern direction, the Yajus in the western direction, the covering in the southern direction, the Vakkuvākya in the northern direction, the Śrī in the eastern direction and the Upabaraṇa in the western direction.
2.25.3	Prajapati and Brihaspati placed the two former feet, Soma and Varuna the two latter.
2.25.4	On her they consecrated this Aditya.
2.25.5	The Vasus for kingship, the Rudras for Vaikajya, the Adityas for Swarajya, the Visve Devas for Samrajya, the Maruts for Sarvashaya, the Sadhyas, Aptas and Paramesthyas.
2.25.6	Now, indeed, it is not by any deity that the sun has been conquered.
2.25.7	Those who were the sons of the gods, they have conquered him.
2.25.8	In him they desired to have a share, as in a king who has conquered, they desire to have a share.
2.25.9	She said, "Give me a share."
2.25.10	This eastern direction gave her a share, saying, "My rising." The day and truth.
2.25.11	The upward direction gave me the kingdom and the country, saying, "May I approach you."
2.25.12	The southern direction gave me food and a chariot, saying, "I shall approach you."
2.25.13	"The northern direction gave me form and color, saying, "Let me approach you."
2.25.14	Space gave me light and unobstructedness, saying, "We have approached you."
2.25.15	The western quarter gave me the truth and the night, saying, "I am going to set." The earth gave me the heat, saying, "After me."
2.26.1	And peace and release.
2.26.2	Then indeed they thought that the best were the ones.
2.26.3	They gave me the journey and the destination, saying, "We are going to you."
2.26.4	Indeed he comes to the waters, by the way of the waters,
2.26.5	The shadows of these stars fall on him from above.
2.26.6	He thus reaches these directions.
2.26.7	It rises in this eastern direction.
2.26.8	It rises towards this upper direction.
2.26.9	It moves thus for six months and thus for six months.
2.26.10	It moves in accordance with the seasons.
2.26.11	It sets in this western direction.
2.26.12	He shines over this earth.
2.26.13	Just as a husband follows his wife, so does he follow her.
2.26.14	He thought, "I alone am all this."
2.26.15	He took the power of the heaven, the power of the stars, the power of men, the eye of cattle, the juice of water, the sap of plants, the chariot of trees, the penis of the young, the light of Agni, the heart of the earth, the smell of gold, the thunder of speech, the meeting of the ancestors, the radiance of the moon.
2.27.4	That is their ascent.
2.27.5	Because they are performing this sacrifice, they are the ones who are in the sacrifice.
2.27.6	Therefore, one should say, "I will strive."
2.27.7	This is a verse about it:
2.27.8	The seven sages are established in the good.
2.27.9	The seven see the two who are well-established.
2.27.10	The seven waters approach this world.
2.27.11	"The two Sattras are born in a dream, where the gods are."
2.27.12	The seven sages are fixed in the well-being, the person is indeed the well-being.
2.27.13	These seven sages are fixed, they are indeed the vital airs.
2.27.14	They see the two (vital airs) well-established in many ways, for they see the two vital airs well-established in various ways.
2.27.15	The seven worlds are reached by the waters. These are the two waters, these are the two, these are the one, these are the twp, these are the lower.
2.27.16	The two who are born without sleep are the two who are in the Sattra. These are the gods. Those who know this thus, they are those deities.
2.28.1	If he stays in the Sattra or not, then it is indeed his own Sattra.
2.28.2	He who, knowing this, retires to the forest, these very deities of his become his shares in the sacrifice. He goes to the end of the year without suffering.
2.28.3	That very one is the year which shines.
2.28.4	What shines of it is the Samvatsara, and what is the dark circle in the middle is the Sarasvati. Thus much about the deity.
2.28.5	Now about the internal.
2.28.6	This very year is the person in the eye.
2.28.7	Of him, what is white is the year, what is the dark circle in the middle is the lake.
2.28.8	This is his verse:
2.28.9	The sun rises from me and sets in me.
2.28.10	All the gods are dependent on me, and nothing goes beyond me.
2.28.11	The sun rises for me alone. He who knows this, for him the sun rises.
2.28.12	He sets for me alone. For him who knows this, he sets.
2.28.13	All the gods are dependent on me. For him who thus knows, all the gods are dependent.
2.28.14	Nothing surpasses me. For him thus knowing, nothing surpasses.
2.29.1	They say, what is the year, what is the course, what is the path?
2.29.2	He should say, the year is indeed the three Vedas.
2.29.3	For all the gods are completed in it.
2.29.4	The day and night are indeed the course.
2.29.5	For they course through this.
2.29.6	The sun is indeed the path.
2.29.7	For he goes through these worlds.
2.29.8	Thus is the deity.
2.29.9	Now the inner.
2.29.10	Food alone is the year.
2.29.11	This whole (universe) indeed flows together.
2.29.12	Speech alone is the lake.
2.29.13	For by speech man moves.
2.29.14	Breath alone is the going.
2.29.15	For it goes in this whole (universe).
2.29.16	He who knows thus the deity and the Self and the Veda as the year, goes to the end of the year without distress. They say: How does the year become one-toned and Barhaspatya?
2.30.1	One should say: By days.
2.30.2	How by days?
2.30.3-5	The two Atiratras, the two Pratiprasthātras, the two Prsthya-Abhipavas, the Abhijit, the three Svarasāman, the three Pratyanga Svarasāman; the Viśvajit, the Goāyuṣī, the Dasāha, the Vaishvadev, the Sapta-triṃśa, the Sviṣṭakṛt, the Rajasuya, the Ekādaśina, the Vājapeya, the Atirātra, the Rajasu-ya, the Ekadashina, the Vajapeya, the Atiratra, the Rajasu ya, the Ekadashi, the Vaja peya, the Ati ratra, the Rajasuya, the Ekadasi, the Vaja-peya, the Ekadasin, the Vaja -peya, the Rajasu -ya, the Ekada-sin, the Vaja pey a, the Rajasu y a, the Ekada sin, the Vajapey a, the Rajasuy a, the Ekadas in, the Vaja p eya, the Rajas uya, the Ek adasi, the V a ja pe ya, the Rajasu ye, the Ekad asi, the Vaja peo ya, the Rajas uy a, the Ekad as in, the V a j a p e y a, the Raj as u ya, the Ek ad asi, the V a jas p e ya, the Raj as uy a, the Rajayu ya, the Ekadas i, the Vaja pei ya, the Rajayu ye, the Ekadasi, the Vajapei ya, the Rajayuy a, the Rajayuyu, the Ekadasu, the Vajapeu ya, the Raj
2.30.6	The thirty-sixfold, the Brihatī, the Kalpa-measured,
2.30.7	Having become the Anushtubh, with animals, with the womb,
2.30.8	They give to the gods, to the ancestors, and to men.
2.30.9	They say that it is twenty and seven hundred. These are indeed the days and nights.
2.30.10	The thirty-sixfold Brihatī is the measure of the Kalpa. Thus indeed, the thirty-sixfold and Brihatī are measured by the days.
2.30.11	Having become Anushtubh, with animals and their source, this very direction brought the cow, this the horse, this the goat, this the sheep.
2.30.12	"The gods took the tribute for the true Anushtubh in the direction of the east." Thus it was.
2.30.13	They give to the gods, to the ancestors, and to men.
2.30.14	Speech is Anushtubh.
2.30.15	All this is dependent on speech.
2.30.16	Thus indeed, the year becomes one-verse-Barhaspatya.
2.31.1	This very one is touched, which blows here.
2.31.2	By this everything is touched.
2.31.3	This is the name of the one who touches.
2.31.4	They call him the one who touches indirectly.
2.31.5	One who knows this touches all desires.
2.31.6	That which shines is the same as the Abhipava.
2.31.7	This shines over everything.
2.31.8	They say that the two are called Prishthya and Abhiplva. They perform the Abhiplva first.
2.31.9	How is it that the Prishthya is performed first?
2.31.10	He should say, "The wind blows below and the sun above."
2.31.11	And because they perform the Abhiplwa first, which is superior, for the purpose of avoiding confusion, for the purpose that there be no deviation, for the purpose (of attaining) the entire life.
2.31.12	They say, "How is it that the four stomas of the Abhijit and the six of the Prsthya are equal?"
2.31.13	He should say, "It is equal because the two deities are similar, namely, Vayu and Aditya."
2.31.14	And also because the Abhijit is Brahman and the Prsthyas are Kshatra.
2.32.1	They say, "These stomas of the Prsthya are uneven: three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, fifteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one, twenty-three, twenty-five, twenty-seven, twenty-nine, thirty-one. How does this become equal to equal?"
2.32.2	He should say, "Brahma is three."
2.32.3	The Kshatriya is fifteen.
2.32.4	Brahma is greater than the Kshatriya.
2.32.5	Therefore it becomes equal to equal.
2.32.6	The Vits are the seventeenth.
2.32.7	The Kshatriyas are superior to the Visas.
2.32.8	One attains equality with them.
2.32.9	The Sudras follow the twenty-one-fold Stoma.
2.32.10	The Vaishyas are superior to Sudras.
2.32.11	One attains equanimity with them.
2.32.12	Domestic animals follow the twenty-three-fold Stoma
2.32.13	The Sudras are superior to domestic animals.
2.32.14	For that is their self.
2.32.15	It becomes equal to that.
2.32.16	The animals of the forest are equal to the thirty-three Stoma.
2.32.17	The domestic animals are superior to the wild animals.
2.32.18	The others move in fear, for the others are the hunters.
2.32.19	It becomes the same as that.
2.32.20	They say, why is the Abhijit-Satra one-formed, and the Prishthya two-formed, when they are the same?
2.32.21	He should say, because this is Brahman, it is Brahman itself.
2.32.22	And because he who is a Kshatriya becomes a Brahmana, therefore the Abhijit-Sattra is one-formed, the Prishthyas are two-formed.
2.32.23	Now some perform the sixth day of the Abhijit as the Ukthya, saying, "Thus it is with the burden."
2.32.24	Now Shatayani said, "Those who do so confuse the Abhijit.
2.32.25	It becomes non-Brahmanical.
2.32.26	Therefore it should not be done thus."
2.32.27	Now some, from the sixth day of the Prsthya (Sacrifice), take out the two-footed (animal). Thus it is with the burden.
2.32.28	Satyayani said, "This is the heavenly world, the Prsthva six-day (Sacrifice).
2.32.29	The sacrificer is the foundation, because it is two-footed.
2.32.30	They remove it from its place.
2.32.31	If he were to say that they are going to be separated from their abode or from this world, then it would be so.
2.32.32	Therefore, one should not do it like that.
2.33.1	They say, "This is the Pravargya rite, which is described as threefold. How does this become connected with the threefold Pravargya?"
2.33.2	He would say, "In that these forty are completed by the Trivṛt, therefore it becomes Trivṛt."
2.33.3	And because the Gāyatrī has twenty-four syllables, therefore it is so.
2.33.4	They say, "How is this the equinoctial day and the Chandomi day?"
2.33.5	He would say, "The Stotriyas of this day are as many as the syllables of the seven metres, with four added."
2.33.6	This makes it a Chandomas.
2.33.7	They say, "How do the Chandomas become performed before the Visuvat, when they are performed after the Visuvat?"
2.33.8	He would say, "The twenty-fourth Stoma of the Chhandogas is to be begun at the beginning of the day. The Chhandogas are to be performed before the Visuva."
2.33.9	And also because the two days of the Prsthya are complete with the Chhandogamas, therefore it is so.
2.34.1	They say, "The six seasons are performed before the equinox, and the seventh is performed after the equinox. How is it that it is performed with the burden?"
2.34.2	He should say, "Whatever is below the equinox is this world, and whatever is above the equinox is that world."
2.34.3	This world is indeed close.
2.34.4	The other one is indeed distant.
2.34.5	This is the second world.
2.34.6	The seventh, namely, the Viśvajit, is the one above the others. Thus it is with the burden.
2.34.7	And he who thus has the Viśva-jit as the seventh, has the others as his burden.
2.34.8	The cow is the Rathantara, the horse the Brihat, the goat the Vaivāha, the sheep the Vaivāhika, the barley the Śakvarī, the wheat the Revatī.
2.34.9	This is the chariot which is yoked together, namely, the Prastara.
2.34.10	This is his axle, in that the Brihat is the Agniṣṭoma Sāman. It is for the non-falling of this chariot.
2.34.11	Now those who perform the Nirhṛta-pṛṣṭha sacrifice, they perform the Viśvajit sacrifice on a chariot with a broken axle.
2.34.12	They do not attain anything.
2.34.13	Therefore the Viśva-jit should be performed only with the Pṛṣṭhas.
2.35.1	Now some of them make the Svara-sāmans the Prstha-s.
2.35.2	Or the Prstha is said to be the day and the Svara-samans are said to be the night.
2.35.3	Therefore the Svara-samams should be made the Prstha.
2.35.4	If they make the Svara the Prstha, then they should make the Stomas which are in the Ekabṛhatī.
2.35.5	Śāṭyāyani said, "We are actually performing the Svara-pṛṣṭhas (i.e., the Svara-s and the Pṛṣṭhas) in the Brihat and Rathantara (Sāman).
2.35.6	This is the Rathantara, that is the Brihat.
2.35.7	This entire universe is covered by these two worlds.
2.35.8	Therefore, the Pṛṣthas should be performed in the Brihat-Rathantara."
2.35.9	Now, indeed, those who perform three (sacrifices) perform the disconnected Svara-saman.
2.35.10	All the rites should be performed.
2.35.11	Thus, by two (sacrifices) each day, he prospers.
2.35.12	Thus the Svarasamas are collected, and they are uninterrupted, because of the exclusion of the evil-sounding. This is what some do in the Brihatis at the Visuvat.
2.36.1	The Visuvat is Bṛhat, the Vasava is Bṛhat.
2.36.2	He shines on this Bṛhatī.
2.36.3	Therefore, the Brihatī should be used for the Brihatī Sāman.
2.36.4	Now some perform the Divākirti Sāman on the Brihatī verses.
2.36.5	The Sāmans are based on the Brihatīs.
2.36.6	This is the Brihatī in the sky.
2.36.7	The wind blows within it.
2.36.8	That is the Sāman. The Divākirti is performed on the Brihatis. The Divākiriti is performed on the Jagatī verses. The Divākiriti is performed on twelve-syllabled verses.
2.36.9	Thus the third pressing is performed without any deficiency.
2.36.10	Now Shaatyaayana said, "The Visuvat (equinox) is the Jagaat (verse)."
2.36.11	This is the Jagaata (verse).
2.36.12	This is the sun.
2.36.13	When he rises, then the world follows the course of this (sun).
2.36.14	Therefore the Divakiirti (verse) should be performed in the Jagaati (verse) only."
2.36.15	Then the three worlds and the four are the Brihatis.
2.36.16	By that, the Brihatis are made.
2.36.17	Those are praised, and the twenty-eight Brihatis are accomplished.
2.36.18	By that alone, the Brihatī is hidden.
2.36.19	And indeed this is the semen of the breath, which is Divākirti.
2.36.20	The Jagatī is the generation.
2.36.21	That is the sun.
2.36.22	Now, when they perform the Jagatī verses, they make it (the Soma) prosper by its own place.
2.36.23	By that which has thus prospered, he prospers among his own people.
2.37.1	They ask about this: What is that which is done in the day-glorifying (rite) by which the offspring are generated and by which they are supported?
2.37.2	He should say, "What is called Divakīrti is semen of the vital breath."
2.37.3	The Jagati is the generation.
2.37.4	By that he generates offspring.
2.37.5	And what he does by becoming the vital breath and supporting the higher and lower days, by that he supports offspring.
2.37.6	The vital breath itself is Divakīrti.
2.37.7	The eyes are Bhraj and Abhraj.
2.37.8	The ear is Vikarṇa.
2.37.9	Speech is Dasastobha.
2.37.10	These vital airs are indeed beneficial in the middle.
2.37.11	Now, they take up the ladle-fulls of clarified butter at sunrise.
2.37.12	At sunrise, they commence the morning recitation.
2.37.13	This is the day named Divākirti.
2.37.14	So that they may not mix it with the night.
2.37.15	Śāṭyāyanī said, "The days are sung with Sāmans and the nights with Ṛks.
2.37.16	This night of theirs is sung with nothing, it becomes empty.
2.37.17	And this morning recitation is indeed Prajapati.
2.37.18	They drive him away from his abode.
2.37.19	If he were to say, "They will be taken away from their abode or from this world," then it would be so.
2.37.20	Therefore, as with the other days, so should it be done.
2.37.21	Prāṇāpāna are the Upaṃśu and Antaryāma.
2.37.22	When the sun has risen, they offer to one; when it has not risen, to another.
2.37.23-25	The Prāṇa outside sustains the Apāna inside. When they offer to another deity at sunrise and to another at sunset, they sustain the Prāṇa outside and the Apāna inside.
2.37.26	If he were to say to them, "The sun is about to set, the vital breaths are about to be withdrawn," then they would indeed be so.
2.37.27	Therefore, one should act as in the other days.
2.38.1	These (rites) depart from one who is being initiated: the Agnihotra, the New and Full Moon sacrifices, the Seasonal sacrifices, the Animal sacrifice, the Pitryajna, the domestic fire, the Brahmo-dana, and the Mithuna.
2.38.2	When he says "Svaha" at the Upasads of Initiation, then his Agnihotra is uninterrupted at the Upasad of Initiation.
2.38.3	When they offer to Upāṃśu and Antaryāma at sunrise and to another deity at sunset, that is for the Sutiya sacrifice.
2.38.4	When there is a cake, that is for Full Moon.
2.38.5	When there are curds, that is for New Moon.
2.38.6	When it is Payasyā, that is for Cāturmāsya.
2.38.7	When they offer animals, that is for Pashubandha.
2.38.8	When they perform the Upasanas, that is for Pitryajña.
2.38.9	The householder's oblation is made with the grains that are collected.
2.38.10	The Brahmic oblation is made from the Soma that is brought in.
2.38.11	The union is made by counting the wives.
2.38.12	Some say, "We are united with you through the breath."
2.38.13	Satyayani said, "This is like a scattered form.
2.38.14	One man alone, indeed, is the breath, and this is not interrupted by knowledge. And as to why they count the Stotra of the Yajayajniya,
2.39.1	they say: "When one praises with different Sāmans, and others chant different ones, then why are the houses the same?"
2.39.2	He should say: "The Sāman is food.
2.39.3	The Ṛk is food.
2.39.4	Breath is the house.
2.39.5	Other (sāmans) bring in food for the other (sāmans).
2.39.6	Therefore they praise with different Sāmans, and others chant different Sāmans. The houses are the same.
2.39.7	The Sāmans are indeed the vital airs.
2.39.8	That is the root.
2.39.9	And just as the trunks, branches, or leaves of a tree, so are the other Sāmans.
2.39.10	He who knows this, all his hymns are known.
2.39.11	Speech is the Rk.
2.39.12	That is the root.
2.39.13	And as the branches, twigs, and leaves of a tree, so are the other hymns.
2.39.14	He who knows this, his hymns are all known.
2.39.15	The mind is the Yajus.
2.39.16	That is its root.
2.39.17	Now, just as the trunk, branches, and leaves of a tree are different, so are the different Yajus formulas.
2.39.18	He who knows this, all his Yajus formulas become known.
2.40.1	They say, "Why do they not praise too much? Why do they not praise excessively? Why do they do not take excessively?"
2.40.2	He should say, "They do not praise the breath too much.
2.40.3	When praised, only the breath remains.
2.40.4	They do not praise speech.
2.40.5	When praised, only speech remains.
2.40.6	They don't grasp the mind.
2.40.7	When grasped, only the mind remains.
2.40.8	One who knows this becomes accomplished without being praised, praised, or grasped.
2.40.9	Then indeed, the sacrifice should be attended only when it is accomplished.
2.40.10	Whatever one does while studying without being harmed, that is heavenly.
2.40.11	One should know that this is heavenly, that one will be in heaven by this.
2.40.12	But whatever one does while studying badly, being harmed, and trembling, that is nourishment, that is procreation.
2.40.13	One should understand that this is nourishment, that one will become many, that one will procreate.
2.41.1	Then indeed there were three former fires: the Lord of the Earth, the Lord of the World, and the Lord of Beings.
2.41.2	This world is the Lord of the earth, the sky is the Lord of worlds, and that world is the Lord over beings.
2.41.3	Then indeed this is the name of Bhūti.
2.41.4	They cut off the heads of those who said "Vashat".
2.41.5	They entered these three earths.
2.41.6	Therefore, if the Agnihotra-offering of ghee spills over, one should touch it with the formula, "To the lord of the earth svāhā, to the lord of the world svāhā, svāhā to the lord of beings."
2.41.7	For it is in these fires that his Agnihotra offering becomes unspilled.
2.41.8	Now there were indeed three ancient sages, Śūrpāyana, Yavama, and Aśvāna, who were farmers in the interior, and they were the Solvalas.
2.41.9	They saw the faults of the sacrifice.
2.41.10	They saw these expiations for it: "May there be peace for me, may there be prosperity for me, may my life be increased, may my sacrifice be increased, may your sacrifice be completed for me, may your sacrifice that has been offered be completed for me."
2.41.11	Therefore, having performed the Darsha-Purnamāsa sacrifices, the Cāturmāsya sacrifices, the animal sacrifice, or the Soma sacrifice, one should recite this (Mantra) afterwards.
2.41.12	Whatever deficiency there is in the sacrifice, that he pacifies with it.
2.41.13	The Prāṇa is the one who does not cross over, the Vyāna is the one who crosses over, and the Apāna is the one above the crossing over.
2.41.14	The Apāna indeed brings everything here.
2.41.15	Therefore, we approach the six days from the other side of the equinox.
2.42.1	Then, the learned Janaki asked about the Soma-offering, saying, "When a mortal lives with Prāṇa and Apāna,
2.42.2	please tell us about it to the assembled Brahmins of the Kurus."
2.42.3	He replied, "I will tell you about it right here."
2.42.4	He replied, "Not by the Prāṇa and Apāna."
2.42.5	"When this mortal man is alive, Vyāna is the overseer of the animal. He moves him around."
2.42.6	The animal is indeed a man.
2.42.7	The animal is the animal.
2.42.8	Vyāna indeed moves him around.
2.42.9	Some of them perform the six days from the day after the Visuva onwards.
2.42.10	Those who perform the Prsthya first, they are excluded.
2.42.11	And also, 'thus we are not excluded.'
2.42.12	Now Shatayani said, 'Both of them are excluded, those who are above and those who are below.
2.42.13	They are excluded by the Savanas. We attain that desire which is in the Avartas.
2.42.14	They say that just as water is the source of all things, so are these (days) the source of all cattle.
2.42.15	Which of these days are they?
2.42.16	The higher or the lower ones?
2.42.17	One should say both.
2.42.18	For these days include both the higher and the lower ones.
2.42.19	Therefore, we perform one sacrifice on three days and another on three days.
2.42.20	He who is two days becomes six days.
2.42.21	After that, it becomes the Goāyuṣī (rite) for a period of ten days.
2.42.22	Some perform the Goāyuși rite after the Viharī rite, and the Ayus rite before the Dasara-rite.
2.42.23	In the same way, they say, for the sheep.
2.42.24	Thus, there is the performance of these two rites.
2.42.25	The Nāimisha foresters, however, were negligent.
2.42.26	They would come together here ten nights before.
2.42.27	Now they come together only after that.
2.42.28	Śāṭyāyanī said, "These two, Prāṇāpāna, are the life of cows.
2.42.29	Those who wander cut off food and drink.
2.42.30	And this is indeed the path of the gods, namely, the life of cows.
2.42.31	This world is heaven, if it is ten nights.
2.42.32	They go to this heavenly world by this path of the gods.
2.42.33	But those who wander and obstruct this path of the divine go nowhere.
2.42.34	Therefore, they perish together.
2.43.1	Gobala, the son of Satya, said to him: "You are like a father, O venerable one, like a grandfather.
2.43.2	I shall consecrate myself for the year; instruct me."
2.43.3	He said, "So be it."
2.43.4	"I shall tell you the course by knowing which one becomes free from distress and attains the end of the year, rising up, one becomes healthy and prosperous."
2.43.5	He said, "They go to those twelve months."
2.43.6	Then the four months that they go to, they go by the path of Agni.
2.43.7	By that they attain Agni and this world.
2.43.8	Then the four other months that they go, they go by Vayu's path.
2.43.9	And by that they attain the world of the gods and the world of the atmosphere.
2.43.10	And the four months which they pass beyond, they pass by the path of the sun.
2.43.11	And by that they attain to the world of the sun and the world of yonder gods.
2.44.1	This is the path of the gods.
2.44.2	Now, they say, he came by the way of non-going.
2.44.3	Those who, not knowing this, undertake the consecration for the year, they go by the way of going.
2.44.4	But those who know this, they go to the end of the year without distress, and rise up, free from suffering, and become prosperous.
2.44.5	They go to that heaven.
2.44.6	This is the day of the great vow.
2.44.7	This indeed is the world of heaven, namely the Mahavrata day.
2.44.8	It consists of twenty-five (days).
2.44.9	Of these, the twenty are Viraj.
2.44.10	And the four are these four directions.
2.44.11	And the twenty-fifth is the upward direction.
2.44.12	The directions are where the sun sets. This world became the highest, called "the one that shines."
2.44.13	They ascend this world through the twenty-five.
2.44.14	They attain the same world as this.
2.44.15	They say, "Why is this Varana (sacrifice) performed with the Pañcavimsa stoma? It is because they desire the most on this day and on the Mahāvrata day."
2.44.16	One should say, "For the purpose of securing the entire food."
2.44.17	He wins the man with five Stotriya verses, the cow with five, the horse with five, the goat with five, the sheep with five.
2.44.18	This is the entire food that is won, and therefore the Pañcaviṃśa Stoma is performed at the end.
2.44.19	And the two Atiratras are indeed the foundation.
2.44.20	In this world they proceed to the Prāyaniya Atiratra and attain stability.
2.44.21	In the other world they proceed to Udayaniya Atiratra and rise up.
2.44.22	They become as if they are not there and stand back.
2.45.1	This is the royal couch of Udumbara.
2.45.2	Some place it with its head towards the east.
2.45.3	One should place it with itshead towards the north.
2.45.4-8	These are her two anterior feet, these are her two posterior feet. Some mount her only from the east. Satyayani said, "They perform the priestly duties from the east. The Udgātṛs are deities of the east. One should mount her from the east.
2.45.9	Some of them mount it with the salutation, "Salutations to thee, O Blessed One! We know thee. May thy grace be on us."
2.45.10	Some of them mount it silently.
2.45.11	Prajapati is the mind.
2.45.12	This is the Prajapati day.
2.45.13	One should mount it first with this (verse), then with this, then with this, and then with this, thinking, "I shall go to the immortal."
2.45.14	Then they bring the arrow with a hundred strings for him who has mounted it.
2.45.15	He consecrates it with this continuity.
2.45.16	Bhūr Bhuvah Svaḥ.
2.45.17	Speak, speak, speak, speak. Speak, speak, speak well.
2.45.18	Wide, easy to go, easy to go to.
2.45.19	Action, doing, hand, about to do.
2.45.20	The speech of Indra, the great, of various forms.
2.45.21	Speak, O arrow of the gods, for a hundred years.
2.45.22	Thus.
2.45.23	Then, with the desire to move, with the desire for the Veda, and with the branch of the Vetasa tree, he draws the mind, saying "The mind is light", "Speech is truth", "The mind is auspicious".
2.45.24	He gives it away.
2.46.1	Then he makes the other ones.
2.46.2	Then he praises.
2.46.3	Then he worships at the head, then on the right wing, then on the left, then at the tail, then at the supreme self.
2.46.4	That is for the one with hair.
2.46.5	The Udgātṛ priest should respond to the Hotr priest with his own self.
2.46.6	He responds to the Hotr with the same verse that the Hotr has recited.
2.46.7	If he responds with a different verse, it is contrary to the proper order.
2.46.8	Some respond first with their own self.
2.46.9	Śāṭyāyanīya said, "It is like a blind person reaching the door."
2.46.10	Then some, having praised and descended, sit down watching the day being praised.
2.46.11	To this Shaatyaayana said, "He who does so becomes the lord of sin."
2.46.12	The Sama is indeed the Kshatra.
2.46.13	The weapon is the Vit.
2.46.14	One should sit above.
2.46.15	One should descend when the king is being taken away.
2.46.16	Then the king descends for him.
2.46.17	The descent of that (goddess) is (thus).
2.46.18	The earth and heaven have mixed this sacrifice.
2.46.19	They have made us rich with burdens.
2.46.20	Having carried this seat around to the north, they place it down.
2.47.1	They say, "What is done here is praised. One should praise the ones who have enjoyed themselves and the ones who have not enjoyed themselves." One should say, "The ones who have enjoyed."
2.47.2	Those who have enjoyed themselves are the deities of the king.
2.47.3	Now, the head is in the Gāyatrī verses, the wings in the Brhatī and Kakup verses, the tail in the two-footed verses, and the body in the Tristubh verses. How is it that it is spread out from here?
2.47.4	Of this self, there are five hundred Tristubh verses,
2.47.5	and from that, the life span is one hundred years.
2.47.6	And the twenty-five that remain are the Purusha.
2.47.7	There are five, five, five, and five (verses). There are four Prastara verses.
2.47.8	The Self is twenty-five.
2.47.9	That man is a hundred years old.
2.47.10	They say that the other Tristubh verses are complete in syllables.
2.47.11	He should say, "The man is Tristubh, born from Tristubh."
2.47.12	These are the incomplete ones of the man.
2.47.13	Therefore, the syllables are fewer.
2.47.14	Now, what is uneven is even by that, the syllables are complete.
2.47.15	They say that the twenty-five-fold Purusha is the praise of the Purusha.
2.47.16	Now, why are these uneven Sāmans performed? For the completeness of the Purusha."
2.47.17	He should say, "The mind indeed is Prajapati.
2.47.18	Prajapati is the Purusha.
2.47.19	This is his inner Self, that these twenty-five Stotriya verses.
2.47.20	And as the hair, nails, body-hair, and beard of a man, so are they.
2.47.21	When these uneven Sāmans are made, it is for the completeness of the man.
2.48.1	They say, "How is it that the Brhatī verses are made from the Brhatī-based Prsthas?"
2.48.2	This Self has fifty-two Brihatī verses and one Kakup verse.
2.48.3	By that, the Brihatī verses are accomplished.
2.48.4	By that alone, the Kakup is not displaced from the Prstha verses.
2.48.5	They say, "What are the five-and-twenty verses?"
2.48.6	One should say, "The verses are in the Pankti metre."
2.48.7-11	This indeed is the metre of the Pañcaviṃśa Stoma, namely, the Paṅkti. In this Self there are seventy-three Paṅktis and half a Paṅkti. Thus the Paṅkti is the metre. They are indeed the twenty-nine Atichandas. Atichandas indeed surpasses all the metres.
2.48.12	All the metres are included in that.
2.48.13	They say, how is this whole day twenty-five?
2.48.14	One should say, 'In abundance.'
2.48.15	How is it in abundance?
2.48.16	There are nine heads of the Gāyatrī metre.
2.48.17	Those have twenty-seven feet.
2.48.18	There are six hundred in the wings, forty-two in the tail.
2.48.19	Taking two from the twenty-seven parts of the head, they place six hundred.
2.48.20	Then twenty-five remain.
2.48.21	Then there are four sets of twenty-five from the hundred.
2.49.2	Those who are the sacrificial offerings of the Prauñca (sutra) and the Upavasatha (rite) go to the other world.
2.49.3	Those who are the sacrificial rites of the Uttaravedi and the Sutyā (rite) go beyond.
2.49.4	If the Bahispavamāna is Trivrit, and if the Stomas are Trivrit, then they go beyond.
2.49.5	The Ajyas are Pañcadaśa, and the Madhyandina Stoma is Pañcadaśin, and if the Stomas are Pañcadaša, then they go
2.49.6	The seventeen-fold Stoma is the seventeen-fold Agniṣṭoma. The seventeen-fold stoma is the seventeenfold Agniṣṭomah. By that they go beyond.
2.49.7	The one-twenty-one-fold Agniṣtoma-sāman is the one-twenty- one-fold Stoma. By that they proceed beyond.
2.49.8	The twenty-one-fold Stoma, all the Stomas come together. By that all the Stomas proceed beyond.
2.49.9	This very Agniṣṭoma is the one that blows here.
2.49.10	Those who are the sacrificial rites of Agni, they are the causes.
2.49.11	And those who are the sacrificial acts of the sun, they are the reasons.
2.49.12	When Agni goes out, it merges into the wind.
2.49.13	When the sun sets, it merges into wind.
2.49.14	Of this one, the Agniṣṭoma has twenty-four praises and eulogies.
2.49.15	Thus there are twenty-four winds: the wind from the east, the wind from the south, the wind from west, the wind from north, the wind from above.
2.49.16	The Stoma of Agniṣṭoma is indeed the Prāṇa.
2.49.17	Those who are in the east, the Yajña-kratus, they are the Vak (speech) by implication. Those who are in the north, the Yajna-kratus, the eyes are by implication.
2.50.1	When he is silent, the speech indeed goes to the Prāṇa.
2.50.2	When he sleeps, the eye goes into the breath.
2.50.3	When one who knows this says, "It is offered by means of the Agnihotra," it is offered by means Agnihotra.
2.50.4	When one says, "It breathes," it is offered through the Agniṣṭoma.
2.50.5	When one sees, it is offered through subsequent (sacrifices).
2.50.6	When he who knows this says, "What breathes, what sees, by these all the sacrifices are offered to him," then it is so.
2.50.7	This year is of equal departure and equal connection.
2.50.8	Its departure is indeed the mind, and its connection is speech.
2.50.9	This year indeed comes to be the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice.
2.50.10	The six Atiratras are performed in excess of the three Uktha-s and the Sandhi-s with three deities.
2.50.11	The three Arahmaniya days are performed in excess.
2.50.12	Then wherever there is the Abhipava, there are seven Agnistoma-s.
2.50.13	Six times the Prsthya is performed.
2.50.14	Two are performed in excess, two are performed in excess.
2.50.15	That is the Agniṣṭoma.
2.50.16	Two, eight, six.
2.50.17	That are these six (bricks) which he lays down.
2.50.18	That is the Agniṣtoma.
2.50.19	The Agniṣṭoma is the Abhijit.
2.50.20	They go beyond the nine Svarasāman (bricks).
2.50.21	That are these three (bricks) which they lay down.
2.50.22	That Agniṣṭoma,
2.50.23	The Agniṣtoma is the Viṣuvaṇ.
2.50.24	They go beyond the nine Svara-s of the Pratiça-s.
2.50.25	They go beyond the five times the Prsthya.
2.50.26	They go beyong two and six.
2.50.27	That is the Agniṣṭoma.
2.50.28	Of one, three.
2.50.29	He places them in these nine.
2.50.30	That is Agniṣṭoma
2.50.31	Agniṣṭoma and Viśvajit.
2.50.32	They go over two and six. 
2.50.33	The twelve-Agniṣṭoma is the ten-night (rite).
2.50.34	The Agniṣṭoma is a day of the Mahāvrata.
2.50.35	They go beyond six Atiratras.
2.50.36	He places these six (bricks) below.
2.50.37	That is the Agniṣṭoma.
2.50.38	They perform the Ṣoḍaśin six times.
2.50.39	That is Agniṣṭoma.
2.50.40	If they perform the Sodashin at the Atiratra, they confuse the prosperity of the Viraj.
2.50.41	They are excluded from the prosperity of the Agnistoma.
2.50.42	That indeed is the thunderbolt without a base, which destroys.
2.50.43	Or the thunderbolt without a support.
2.50.44	This year has a common end and a common connection.
2.50.45	Its end is indeed the mind, and its connection is speech.
2.50.46	This is the year, and he attains the Agniṣṭoma.
2.50.47	One attains the Agniṣțoma by means of prosperity.
2.50.48	Those days are obtained which are in the year, the Citriyas.
2.50.49	By means of this method one attains both desires, the one of the Agniṣṭomayana and the one of the Māsiprāṣṭra.
2.51.1	The two seasons of the past were the seasons of the vital airs and the seasons of the gods.
2.51.2	Now these are the seasons of the present.
2.51.3	The spring was the vital air.
2.51.4	The summer was speech.
2.51.5	The rains were the eye.
2.51.6	The rains are like moisture, for the eye is like moisture.
2.51.7	The autumn was the ear.
2.51.8	The winter was the mind.
2.51.9	The cold is the waters that are in the body.
2.51.10	Now the seasons of the gods.
2.51.11	Vayu himself was spring.
2.51.12	Agni was summer.
2.51.13	Parjanya was the rainy season.
2.51.14	Aditi was autumn.
2.51.15	The moon was winter.
2.51.16	Those heavenly waters are the cold season.
2.51.17	That which is the breath, that was spring, that which is Vayu, that is spring, that is this spring now.
2.51.18	Now that speech which was in the summer, and that Agni which was in the spring, that is this present summer.
2.51.19	Now that eye which was in the rains, and those Parjanya which were in the rains, those are these present rains.
2.51.20	Now that ear which was in the autumn, and that Aditya which was in the autum, that is this autumn.
2.51.21	Now that which was the mind in the winter and the moon in the winter, that is this winter now.
2.51.22	Now those which were the waters on the earth in the winter and those which were the heavenly waters, that is this cold now.
2.52.1	These are the six seasons and the six directions.
2.52.2	Those seasons are the directions, in pairs: this eastern direction is in pair with spring, this southern direction is in pairwith summer, this western direction is in pair withe the rains, this northern direction is in pair wiht autumn, this direction above is in pair with winter, this direction below is in pair with the cold season.
2.52.3	Just as a wife would look at her husband without blinking, so do they look at the one who knows this, when he is initiated.
2.52.4	And because he is looked at by the directions, therefore he is called 'initiated'.
2.52.5	He should approach the sun while being initiated, saying, "You are the deity who has been initiated."
2.52.6	It takes away the brilliance, strength, energy, and fame of one being initiated.
2.52.7	Do not take away my brilliance, strength, power, and fame.
2.52.8	Following your initiation, I am initiated."
2.52.9	Then he ascends the seasons.
2.52.10	Those who were in the seasons before the sun and the moon,
2.52.11	before the sun and the Moon.
2.52.12	By whom, knowing, he has conquered the directions and the quarters.
2.52.13	I ascend them by means of austerity and Brahman.
2.52.14	Thus he ascends the seasons by means of austerity.
2.52.15	Those who are the seasons above the moon,
2.52.16	They became the Veda, speech, and Brahman.
2.52.17	For thus he became.
2.52.18	By whom, knowing, one has conquered the directions, the quarters,
2.52.19	I ascend them by means of penance and Brahman.
2.52.20	Thus he ascends the seasons of the gods.
2.52.21	He who is one season and three seasons,
2.52.22	He who is six, twenty-four seasons,
2.52.23	Twelve, seventeen, and twenty,
2.52.24	I ascend them by means means of penance and Brāhman.
2.52.25	Thus he ascends these seasons.
2.52.26	Thus he is encompassed by those seasons.
2.52.27	Just as he is encompassed by the seasons, so he goes to the end of the year without distress.
2.52.28	The season is indeed for one who knows thus.
2.53.1	Kesi Darbhya initiated at the leaves of the Darbha grass.
2.53.2	Then, having heard, the hawk Yajnasena became golden and sat down near the sacrificial post.
2.53.3	He addressed him by the name "Kesi."
2.53.4	He became angry, saying, "I am the elder king of the Panchalas.
2.53.5	I am indeed consecrated.
2.53.6	Who is worthy of addressing me by a contemptuous name?"
2.53.7	He said, "Do not be angry.
2.53.8	He has told me that I am the king of this village before you.
2.53.9	He has indeed told me that you are not initiated.
2.53.10	You know the extent of what is to be given and what is to be received.
2.53.11	I know the initiation.
2.53.12	Let us speak together.
2.53.13	He said, "Agni is consecrated, the earth is consecration, Vayu is consecrated, the atmosphere is consecration, Aditya is consecrated, the sky is consecration, Prajapati is consecrated, the mind is consecration.
2.53.14	He should be initiated by that initiation by which Agni was initiated, by that initiation by that initiation by whicch Vayu was initiated, by which Aditya was initiated, by whicch Prajapati was initiated, by this initiation he should be initiated.
2.54.1	Then the other said:
2.54.2	When giving to a Brahman, he should say, "Brahman, I am giving you my mind. I am buying it back with this." If he is going to give something, he should say this.
2.54.3	When he gives his mind, he gives the moon to him. He gives him the moon.
2.54.4	As long as the moon does not wane, his gift does not wane.
2.54.5	When giving to the Hotṛ, he should say, "O Hotṛ, I am giving you speech. I am redeeming it with this. O Hotṛ, I give this." If he is going to give something.
2.54.6	When he gives speech, Agni is speech. He gives Agni to him.
2.54.7	As long as Agni does not perish, his gift does not perish.
2.54.8	When giving to the Adhvaryu, he should say, "O Adhvaryu! I am giving you life. I am redeeming it with this. O Adhvaryu!" If he is going to give something.
2.54.9	When he gives life, life is Vayu. He gives him Vayu.
2.54.10	As long as Vayu does not perish, his gift does not perish.
2.54.11	When giving to the Udgātṛ, he should say, "I am giving the eye to the Udgātr; I am redeeming it with this. I am giving this to the Udgätṛ." If he is going to give something.
2.54.12	What he gives as the eye, that is the sun. He gives him the sun.
2.54.13	As long as the sun does not perish, so long does his eye not perish.
2.54.14	When giving to a member, he should say, "I give you my self. I am buying him with this. I am giving this to the member." If he is to be given,
2.54.15	When he gives his self, the self is space. He gives him space.
2.54.16	As long as space does not perish, his gift does not perish.
2.54.17	When giving to the Hotrakas, he should say, "O Hotrakas, I am giving you the ear. I am buying it with this. O Hotrakas, this is what I am giving." If he is going to give something.
2.54.18	When he gives the ear, he gives the directions. He gives them the directions.
2.54.19	As long as the directions do not perish, his gift does not perish.
2.54.20	When giving to the Pra sarpaka, he should say, "I give you the hair of the Pra sarpaka. I am buying them with this. I am giving this to the Pra sarpakas." If he is going to give something.
2.54.21	When he gives hair, it is the plants and trees that are the hair. He gives them the plants and trees.
2.54.22	As long as the herbs and trees do not perish, so long does his gift not perish.
2.54.23	This is the limit of the fulfilled and the unfulfilled.
2.54.24	He who knows this limit of the fulfilled or the unfulfilled, his fulfilled and unfulfilled do not perish.
2.54.25	They say, indeed, that the initiated one is speech, the initiation is speech, speech destroys everything.
2.54.26	Speech alone is all this, that is why they say so.
2.54.27	He said, "One should consecrate with the Rathantara, consecrate with the Vamadevya, consecrate with Brihat." One should consecrate with Brihata.
2.54.28	One should release with the Brihat, release with the Vamadetya, release with the Rathantara."
2.54.29	This is the method of consecration and release.
2.54.30	He who knows this method of initiation and liberation becomes more powerful.
2.55.1	Hṛtsvasya, Āśaya, Āllākeya, Danta-Alasa, Dhūmya, and his disciple were the teachers.
2.55.2	Then Danta-Alāsa Dhūmya mastered the three Vedas and became a teacher.
2.55.3	From him, he learned the Sama Veda and taught it to those who were going to be initiated for a year.
2.55.4	Then they used to wander about asking questions, saying, "We shall be initiated for the year."
2.55.5	Then they used to ask each other about the rules of conduct, shouting and crying.
2.55.6	They used to be initiated when they had completed their studies.
2.55.7	This is always the blessing.
2.55.8	That is the sacrifice which they perform when they rise up making that very Brāhmaṇa (the officiating priest) with whom they are initiated with the words of a non-Brāhmaṇa.
2.55.9	Therefore one should be initiated with the words uttered by a non-Brāhmana.
2.55.10	For him, his royal kinsman has placed a tiger-skin, a gem and gold.
2.55.11	He said to the brahmin who was sent to him, "I shall be initiated for the year. Please instruct me."
2.55.12	They think that he should tell his friend, the king.
2.56.1	He went to Somaśuṣma Sātīyayogi, wandering like that.
2.56.2	He said to him, "O Pracinayogi, I shall be initiated for a year.
2.56.3	O Lord, please instruct us."
2.56.4	He said, "So be it."
2.56.5	He pleased him by speaking thus.
2.56.6	He went to him.
2.56.7	He (the teacher) taught him this arrangement. He understood it, arranged the Prāstāra and Pratihāra (sāman), and then he instructed him.
2.56.8	"This indeed is the year," he said.
2.56.9	"This is indeed the path of the gods, these are the two ways, this is the way."
2.56.10	When he knows this, he goes to the end of the year.
2.56.11	Prajapati is indeed a man.
2.56.12	Prajapti is the year.
2.56.13	He who is a man, he who is the space in the sky, he is indeed that man.
2.56.14	That which is seen in the sky does not delight because of its fullness.
2.56.15	Then, because he sees all this in the sky, therefore it is the sky.
2.56.16	Then, because all this is yoked to it, therefore it is wind.
2.56.17	Then, since all this blows, therefore it is Vāta.
2.56.18	The self of this sky is the Dāmuhūta, which is the sun.
2.56.19	This person is in the sun.
2.56.20	Now that which is beyond that, the ether, that is his Self, the one who is confused, who is the moon.
2.56.21	That is the man in the moon.
2.56.22	"He is not to be thought of as different," so said Shatayani.
2.56.23	"He who is the man in your eyes, he is the man in this sun, he is the one in the moon."
2.56.24	He attains him by this very method of the man.
2.57.1	The Prāyaniya Atiratra is indeed the breath.
2.57.2-7	For this entire (universe) is sustained by Prāṇa. And because it sustains, therefore it is Prāṇa. The day of commencement is indeed speech. For by speech all the rites of the year and all the sacrifices are commenced. Therefore on the day of commencement all forms are performed. For all forms are in speech.
2.57.8	This is one Abhiplva, this is one, this is one and this is one.
2.57.9	This is the first day of that Abhiplva.
2.57.10	This is its morning pressing, this is its midday pressing and this is its third pressing.
2.57.11	This is indeed the second day.
2.57.12	This is his morning pressing, this is his midday pressing, this is the third pressing.
2.57.13	This very Vaimāntaka is the third day.
2.57.14	This is his morning pressing; this is his midday press-ing; this is the third press-ing.
2.57.15	This very Śākvara is the fifth day.
2.57.16	Therefore one can take it up by this.
2.57.17	This is his morning pressing, this his midday pressing, this his third pressing.
2.57.18	This is the sixth day, the Raivata.
2.57.19	Therefore one eats with this.
2.57.20	This is his morning pressing; this his midday pressing; this his third pressing;
2.57.21	Thus it is of the Abhipava, thus it is of the Abhiplava.
2.57.22	This very Self is the Prsthya (rite).
2.57.23	These very are the nine breaths.
2.57.24	The Trivrt (rite) is the Prayaniya day, because it makes all this breathe.
2.57.25	And because it makes it breathe, therefore this is the Prayaniyaka day.
2.57.26	These very are (the rites of) the fifteen days.
2.57.27	Ojas is indeed valour.
2.57.28	The neck is ojas.
2.57.29	Valour is the fifteen days.
2.57.30	Therefore cattle carry the burden with their necks.
2.57.31	These are the eight vital parts, these are the eight upper vital parts, the seventeenth.
2.57.32	That is the seventeenth day.
2.57.33	This is the twenty-first day.
2.57.34	All the Stomas are united with the twenty-first.
2.57.35	All food is established in the belly.
2.58.1	These are the thirteen layers of the embryo, these are the thirteen layers around the embryo, twenty-seven.
2.58.2	That is the twenty-ninth day.
2.58.3	These are the thirty-three layers of the skin together with the Kinkalukas.
2.58.4	That is indeed the thirty-third day.
2.58.5	This is Abhijit, this is Vishvajit, the white and black eyelashes.
2.58.6	These three are the Svara-sāman-s, these three are the Visuva.
2.58.7	The Prāṇa and Apāna are the Gōāyuṣī.
2.58.8	These ten are the Prāṇas, the Dasātrā.
2.58.9	The mind is the Mahāvratiya day.
2.58.10	The Udāna is the Udayanīya Atiratra.
2.58.11	These ten Prāṇas are the ten Stoma-s, the ten metres.
2.58.12	These are the seven principal Prāṇas. Two are below the navel. The tenth is in the navel.
2.58.13	These are the Stomas of the six-day Pañcavimśa stoma.
2.58.14	The Chandomas are the Pañcavimsa stoma.
2.58.15	These seven are divided into four, with the last four being the Viraj and Atichandas.
2.58.16	The vital breath is the Gāyatrī, the eyes are the Uṣṇīka and Kakubha, the ears are the Jagatī, speech is the Anuṣṭubh, the mind is the Brihatī, the body is the Paṅkti, strength is the Tristubh.
2.58.17	The foundation is the Vipada, flesh is the Virāṭ, the bodies are the Atichandas.
2.58.18	Of these seven chandas with four extra, there are twelve and twenty one.
2.59.1	The Gāyatrī, the Uṣṇīṣa, and the Anushtup have eighty-four syllables.
2.59.2	They are four times twenty-one.
2.59.3	The Paṅkti and the Tristubh have eighty-four aksharas.
2.59.4	They are also four times twenty- one.
2.59.5	The Brihatī and the Jagatī have eighty-four akṣaras.
2.59.6	They are again four times twenty-1.
2.59.7	Now there are one hundred and ten syllables in the three meters.
2.59.8-14	The Viraj has thirty syllables. The Atichandas has sixty syllables. These make up a hundred and ten syllables. Then he takes two more. Then there are twelve Trivrit (verses). He places these twelve Trivrit verses in the Ekavimsa (verse).
2.59.15	Those twelve months and thirty-two days are completed. They complete the Trivrit Stoma and the Chhandas.
2.60.1	And the Ekavimsa, the Panca, the Pranas, the Agni, and the Aditya.
2.60.2	And those two syllables are the Bṛhat and the Rathantara. They are the day and night.
2.60.3	That is the half-month, that is the month, that is the season, that is the year.
2.60.4	They say that the vital airs are the metres. They say that the metres are the Stomas. How does the Sacrificer reach the metres with the vital airs?
2.60.5	With the metres, with the Stomas, with the Brihat and Rathantara Stomas, with day and night, with the half-month, with the month, with the season, with the year.
2.60.6	Where does the year come from? Where is it established?
2.60.7	He should know, "I am the year, I am established in it."
2.60.8	One who knows thus indeed generates the year, one who knows thus is established.
2.60.9	And they say, "The sun itself is the year."
2.60.10	For all glory, all fame, and all gods are united in him. Therefore the Sun alone is the year.
2.60.11	What shines in him is the year; what is the dark circle in the middle is the Sarā. Thus it is in relation to the deity.
2.60.12	Now in relation to the Self:
2.60.13	This very person in the eye is the year.
2.60.14-18	What is white in it is the year; what is the dark circle in the middle is the lake. They say that the sun is the year and the moon is the lake. He moves in it. He attains it at the full moon. They say, indeed, that the breath is the year and speech is the lake.
2.60.19	For these two (sāmans) are sung together. The path to heaven is indeed the Agniṣṭoma Sāmans of this year.
2.61.1	These are called the Rauhiṇakas.
2.61.2	By these indeed the gods ascended to heaven.
2.61.3	Because they ascended, therefore they are called Rauhiṇakas (the ascending ones).
2.61.4	Therefore we perform the Agniṣṭomasāmans every day.
2.61.5	Then the two verses of the Brihat and Rathantara (Samans).
2.61.6	By these two verses he moves.
2.61.7	Therefore we perform the two verses of Brihat and Rathantara at the Atiratra. May the complete Sama carry the sacrifice, may we eat the complete Sama-verse.
2.61.8	Then the Gati (verse).
2.61.9	And the person in the sun and the one in the self, that is the path of Prajapati. One should meditate on it thus.
2.61.10	By this path Prajapati attained this prosperity and this individual attainment.
2.61.11	He who knows this obtains the same prosperity and the same share as Prajapati obtained.
2.62.1	This indeed is the consecrated one, who shines here.
2.62.2	He is consecrated for supremacy, pre-eminence and superiority.
2.62.3	The rays that are below him are his beard, and the ones that are above are his hair.
2.62.4	The color of the black antelope skin is indeed the day and night.
2.62.5	The color white is indeed the day, and the color black is the night.
2.62.6	Now, that which is this circle, those are the waters, that is food, that is nectar.
2.62.7	In this circle, there is a person made of light and composed of the Vedas.
2.62.8	He is indeed the vital breath, he is indeed Indra, he is indeed Prajapati, he is indeed the initiated one.
2.62.9	This is indeed what is included in initiation.
2.62.10	From that he releases food for these creatures.
2.62.11	His wives were indeed these directions.
2.62.12	Those three directions went beyond him.
2.62.13	This one indeed was his most obedient, namely this southern direction.
2.62.14	Therefore he returns to this one.
2.62.15	Even though he rises up in the north, he returns to this (wife).
2.62.16	Therefore he should make his beloved wife sit on the right side.
2.63.1	He binds the first (wife), recites the first (hymn), and comes with the first full vessel. The wives are not separated.
2.63.2	The sacrificial rite is performed towards the east.
2.63.3	Thus indeed is the deity.
2.63.4	Now the internal.
2.63.5	The person in the eye is indeed the initiated one.
2.63.6	His feathers are the hairs on the head and the beard, and the ones above are the hairs.
2.63.7	The white and black (parts) are the form of the black antelope skin.
2.63.8	The white is the form of the white, the black is the form of black.
2.63.9	And that which is this circle, those are the waters, that is the food, that is the nectar.
2.63.10	In this circle, there is a person made of light and made of the Vedas.
2.63.11	He is the vital breath, he is Indra, he is Prajapati, he is the initiated one.
2.63.12	He who knows thus, when initiated, becomes like the initiated one, who has attained the highest, the best, the supreme.
2.63.13	Therefore, he who knows thus, is the lord of the kingdoms, when initiated, for he becomes like the one who has been shaken by the trembling of the earth, as if he were in a hollow.
2.63.14	Thus indeed, he becomes consecrated for the supremacy and pre-eminence of the senses.
2.63.15	Therefore, one should address the teacher, father and the Kṣatriya as 'all'.
2.63.16	Thus indeed, he becomes consecrate for the supremacy and the pre-eminence.
2.64.1	He speaks words that are discerning.
2.64.2	Food is discerning.
2.64.3	He speaks words that are full of food.
2.64.4	He speaks words that are wise.
2.64.5	Soma is wise.
2.64.6	Food is Soma.
2.64.7	He speaks such words that are full with food.
2.64.8	He says words that are wise,
2.64.9	Prana is wise.
2.64.10	His companion is speech.
2.64.11	He speaks the words that are full in companionship.
2.64.12	He speaks words that are discerning.
2.64.13	Food is discerning.
2.64.14	Through food, these creatures see.
2.64.15	From them, he gives food to the creatures.
2.64.16	When he gives him a vow, he should give it all, for the sake of securing all food.
2.64.17	If he were to sprinkle it, he should say, "Drink or eat."
2.64.18	If the one who gives the vow were to eat without finishing it or were to sprinkle it around, he should sprinkle it with water and say, "Let it be sprinkled in the shade."
2.64.19	He should say, "Let the plants cover it."
2.64.20	He sprinkles the roots of the plants.
2.64.21	The rain-god becomes bountiful where one who knows this consecrates himself.
2.64.22	They say that the consecrated one is like a thirsty one.
2.64.23	When the Diksaniyesti is concluded, when the Adhvaryu anoints him, when he is purified, then he should address the sun: "You, O god, are consecrated."
2.64.24	It takes away the strength, seniority, supremacy and fame of one who is being consecrated.
2.64.25	Do not take away my power, my pre-eminence, my glory.
2.64.26	"He says, "I follow your consecration."
2.64.27	This deity of his does not take away his power, his pre-eminence and his glory.
2.65.1	The Adhvaryu anoints him and then offers the Udgṛhṇānas.
2.65.2	When he offers the Udgrahana oblations, when he gives the Udumbara staff, then he should approach the Ahavaniya fire and say, "May my speech be consecrated to Agni, may my breath be consecrated to Vayu, may my sight be consecrated to Surya, may my mind be consecrated to Prajapati."
2.65.3	Now, with these deities, who are not in distress, he consecrates his own deities.
2.65.4	Then he says, "Agni is consecrated, the earth is consecration. May that consecration consecrate me. With that consecration, I am consecrated."
2.65.5	"Vayu is consecrated, the atmosphere is consecration. May it consecrate me. By that consecration, I consecrate."
2.65.6	"Aditya is consecrated, the sky is consecration. May this consecration consecrate me."
2.65.7	Prajapati, the initiated, the mind, that is the initiation. May I be initiated by that initiation.
2.65.8	May my speech follow the Ṛks, the mind the Yajuses, the breath the Sāmans.
2.65.9	May my faith be initiated by Soma, the king.
2.66.3	Therefore, one should not be envious of the king during the consecration.
2.66.4	For this is the vow of the king, and these worlds are of the same vow, and the metres are of the same vows, and Soma, the king, is of the same vows.
2.66.5	Then he says, "Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Svaḥ Suposhaḥ, with nourishment, Suviraḥ, with heroes, Suprajaḥ, with offspring."
2.66.6	He thus prays for this unlimited blessing, "May my penance be established."
2.66.7	He thus establishes his penance.
2.66.8	"May my faith be firm," he thus establishes his faith.
2.66.9	"May truth be my householder," this indeed is truth.
2.66.10	Truth is that which shines here.
2.66.11	This is the deity that is not afflicted.
2.66.12	He makes her the lord of the house, not in distress.
2.66.13	He is indeed the good vow.
2.66.14	For if he were to be bad, he would burn everything here.
2.66.15	Therefore the lord of the household should be of good vow.
2.66.16	If he were to transgress the vow of the uninitiated, or speak of a sin when there is none, or commit adultery, or do anything wrong, he should approach this sun with all these mantras.
2.66.17	Then indeed he becomes initiated.
2.66.18	Now he is indeed uninitiated.
2.66.19	Whatever glory there was in him when he was initiated, that same glory is in him now.
2.66.20	They say, "One should initiate himself or one should initiate another, one who knows the separation of the glory of the initiated."
2.66.21	The black antelope skin is indeed the glory of the initiate.
2.66.22	For this is the form of all the Vedas.
2.66.23-27	The white ones are the form of the Sāmans, the black ones are the form or the Rks. If otherwise. Those which are tawny like the yellow ones are the form (of the Yajus). Therefore, even if he is not seen, they look at him, for this is the glory of the initiated in him.
2.67.1	Those who, having put on the black garment, enter the water, and those who are excluded from the fame of the initiated, they, having washed away their entire self along with sin, go away.
2.67.2	When the Avabhrtha-sacrifice is concluded, he should release the skin of black antelope and sprinkle it with water, saying, "From Indra, from the eldest, from the best, may I not be deprived." Then he gives to him whom he thinks worthy.
2.67.3	Then he sips water, saying, “Thou art the Avabhrthas of eating, thou art the Avabhrtas of eating, thou are the Avabhrtas of eating."
2.67.4	Whatever is stuck to the sacrificial grass here, that is his share.
2.67.5	Then he enters the water.
2.67.6	Water is a means of cleansing, a means of purification.
2.67.7	He thus resorts to a means of cleansing and purification, for the sake of removing sin.
2.67.8	If the water should flow away, he should go against the stream, saying, "Carry away my sin."
2.67.9	All the waters flow towards him.
2.67.10	Those that are fixed and below flow towards him. They carry away his evil towards the lower direction.
2.67.11	The husband and wife run towards each other's back.
2.67.12	The waters are the thunderbolt.
2.67.13	By means of the thunderbolt they remove all evil.
2.67.14	Then indeed that is a pair, they make procreation for procreation.
2.67.15	Having bathed, one should quickly rise, for the quick removal of sin.
2.68.1	He says, "O Unnetr, lead me up."
2.68.2	Vishnu is the Unnetr, for Vishnu is the sacrifice.
2.68.3	He thus releases him from all sin and leads him up.
2.68.4	We have risen above the darkness, seeing the light above.
2.68.5	We have gone to the god, the divine Sun, the supreme light.
2.68.6	Reciting this, he rises.
2.68.7	This is indeed the supreme light, which shines here.
2.68.8	This is the deity that is not in distress.
2.68.9	Beginning with this deity that is not distressed, he rises.
2.68.10	He places the kindling-wood on the Āhavaniya fire, saying, "Thou art kindling-wood, thou art radiance; do thou place radiance in me. Svāhā!"
2.68.11	Having placed it, he stands up,
2.68.12	I have rubbed the waters, I have united with the juice.
2.68.13	O Agni, I have come to the place of milk. May you unite me with radiance.
2.68.14	Thus.
2.68.15	In the same way, the wife stands by the Garhapatya after placing it on the fire.
2.68.16	Taking the ladle with ghee, going around the Gārhapatya on the north, and sitting down on the south, placing the black antelope skin on the lap, taking four spoonfuls of ghee, he offers with the verse, "May Agni bestow lordship, seniority, and supremacy upon me. Svāhā."
2.68.17	Whatever fame he has when he is initiated, that fame he has when risen.
2.68.18	He should not give the black antelope skin to him. He should not perform the consecration of the ladle. He should not sprinkle the oblation. He should not again deposit it for the one who is re-initiated.
2.68.19	This indeed is the initiation of Keśinī.
2.68.20	Keśin, the son of Dārbhī, resorted to this initiation.
2.69.1	When Death and Prajapati performed sacrifices, they competed with each other through sacrifices.
2.69.2	Then the sacrificial implements were present, just as they are now at the Iṣṭi.
2.69.3	What is praised in the sacrifice, what is praised, what is offered, that is the army of Prajapati.
2.69.4	Now whatever is sung in the Vena, whatever is danced, whatever is done in vain, that is the army of Death.
2.69.5	They both had equal armies, as much as the one had, so much the other had.
2.69.6	They both wandered for many years, not conquering each other.
2.69.7	Prajapati desired, "May I conquer Death."
2.69.8	He saw this prosperity at the sacrifice, this counting.
2.69.9	By that he conquered death.
2.69.10	The defeated one was expelled by the king.
2.69.11	Having fallen on the other side, he approached the women's quarters.
2.69.12	Therefore, the wife is called 'the one who has a son' because she has a son. But this is not so, because he did not have a son. The praises and hymns that were his are now sung on the vina, danced to, and performed in vain. They are the same.
2.70.1	And the sacrificial post that was there, that is now the handle of the vina.
2.70.2	Now those that were the girdles, they are the same as the strings of the lute.
2.70.3	Now that which was the cauldron, it is the same as the lute-hole.
2.70.4	Now that was the covering of skin, it is the skin of the lute.
2.70.5	Now those who were the Uparavas, they are the same as these strings of the lute.
2.70.6	Now those who were the Gravas, they are the very same as the instruments for playing the lute.
2.70.7	And those who were the seven and four extra metres, they are the seven strings of the lute.
2.70.8	Now those Stomas which were in the ten-night (rite), they are indeed these ten fingers.
2.70.9	They say, there is no Sansa now.
2.70.10	For that which was the second sacrifice, it was impure.
2.70.11	There is only one sacrifice.
2.70.12	Prajapati is indeed the sacrifice.
2.71.1	Or else, from here, it is only for counting.
2.71.2	Now, of that year, there are seven hundred and twenty days and nights.
2.71.3	They are eighty-nine.
2.71.4	Now, of its pressings, there are eighty thousand and three.
2.71.5	So many are the Pavamana verses.
2.71.6	That is sung in a verse:
2.71.7	These eight nines are the days and nights of the year.
2.71.8	There are eighty Savanas, three thousand Pavamānas and all.
2.71.9	Then there are sixty-two thousand hymns and praises.
2.71.10	Then there is the number of the fires that are carried in the Dhiṣṇyas, which is ten thousand eight hundred and thirty.
2.71.11	This is sung in a verse:
2.71.12	Two hundred and sixty months, six hundred and sixty Sutras and Sastras, and a hundred and sixty hundreds.
2.71.13	Ten thousand eight hundred years, thirty Dhiṣṇyas in a year.
2.72.1	So many are the stars, so many are the luminaries, so many are suns.
2.72.2	He who knows this obtains the stars, the constellations, the luminaries, and the suns.
2.72.3	Now, his hymns are ninety-nine thousand, three hundred and ninety.
2.72.4	This is expressed in a verse:
2.72.5	His hymns are ninety-one thousand, three hundred, and ninety.
2.72.6	He, praised by them, comes, wearing the garment of the past, the future, and the world, the creator of beings.
2.72.7	And his feet have four thousand, thirty thousand, seven hundred and fifty feet.
2.72.8	This is sung in a verse:
2.72.9	Four thousand, thirty thousand seven hundred and fifty.
2.72.10	The middlemost of the year, praised by the poets, is this much, the measure of the gods.
2.73.1	Now, of these letters, there are one hundred thousand, sixty hundred thousand, two million, and nine thousand seven hundred letters, ten times ten thousand.
2.73.2	This is sung in a verse:
2.73.3	One hundred thousand, sixty million, two million, nine thousand seven hundred.
2.73.4	The seven thousand are the ten, and this is the supreme Self of Prajapati.
2.73.5	This is indeed endless, that which is counting.
2.73.6	This is truly immortal, that which is the counting.
2.73.7	This indeed is well-done, that which is counted.
2.73.8	But what is not counted is mortal.
2.73.9	Therefore one should indeed see it as being.
2.73.10	This indeed, that which is numbered, is the army of the gods.
2.73.11	He who wishes to strike him with the human army, strikes him with that.
2.73.12	He who wishes to strike with the divine army, strikes him thus.
2.73.13	Now these three paths are well-trodden, divine, without decay, and leading to the Rk and Sāman.
2.73.14	The learned ones lead the Brahman to where death is, and food is.
2.73.15	This is expressed in a verse.
2.73.16	There are three paths, well-trodden by the gods, the imperishable ones, the Rik and the Rk-based ones.
2.73.17	The learned ones lead the Brahman to where death becomes his food.
2.73.18	Licking the nectar in stages,
2.74.1	The gods go to heaven from the divine sacrifice.
2.74.2	The sages, having followed the path of Tapas and Karma,
2.74.3	Having overcome death by means of knowledge,
2.74.4	Knowing and burning, they go to grief.
2.74.5	The wise ones fall without any support.
2.74.6	Where there is neither immortality nor death,
2.74.7	There the learned sages perish.
2.74.8	Thus knowing, the priests, at the sacrifice, carry the worlds, cattle and desires to the sacrificer.
2.74.9	He attains the praise and eulogy at sacrifices, whose priests are inexhaustible, the Adhvaryu, Hotṛ, and the Sāman-chanter.
2.74.10	To him the Vedas flow like a stream of honey.
2.74.11	He who at sacrifices obtains the praise and the hymn, to whom his priests, the Adhvaryu, the Hotṛ, and the Sāman-chanter, are imperishable,
2.74.12	to him the metres, flowing like the stream of immortality, carry the hymns and praises.
2.75.1	Each of these syllables is as big as this earth.
2.75.2	The honey of food, the nectar of food, the desire of desire, the desire of the desire, is standing.
2.75.3	The Brahman who knows this lives for a thousand years of the gods.
2.75.4	What is obtained, that is attained. What is attained, that is known again.
2.75.5	Therefore, they give to a brahmin who knows this, saying, "We desire the food, the drink, the honey, the nectar, the desire, the desire of this."
2.75.6	Just as one buys a field or a piece of land, in the same way, those who know this buy the world from a brahmin.
2.75.7	Just as when a buyer has decided, the fields belong to the owner of the fields, so when one has decided, the worlds belong to the one who sees.
2.75.8	If a brahmin who knows this were to accept the whole earth, he would be entitled to only one syllable.
2.75.9	Therefore, a brahmin who has this knowledge should give and receive.
2.76.1	Janaka, the king of Videha, performed a sacrifice with a lot of gifts.
2.76.2	The Brahmanas of the Kurus and Panchalas came together for that.
2.76.3	He released a thousand cows and said, "Brahmanas, whoever is the most learned among you, let him come forward."
2.76.4	Vasat-Suneya said, "Let the learned ones come forward."
2.76.5	They said to him, "Are you the most venerable among us?"
2.76.6	He said, "Salutations to the most venerable among you.
2.76.7	We are only interested in cows."
2.76.8	They said, "Who will ask him?"
2.76.9	He said (he would), "I am Vidagdha Sakalya."
2.76.10	They placed him at the forefront.
2.76.11	When he had gone away, he said to him, "The Brahmanas have made you the Ulgamukavasayana."
2.76.12	He said, "If we are the Ulgamukavasyana because of that, then you should ask me."
2.76.13	He asked him, "How many gods are there, O Yajnavalkya?"
2.77.9	Oṃ, he said.
2.77.10	Which are the three, thirty, three hundred, and three thousand?
2.77.11	He said, "Their greatness is indeed so."
2.77.12	"Indeed, there are thirty-three."
2.77.13	Which are the thirty-three?
2.77.14	The eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the twelve Adityas, Indra and Prajapati, and the thirty-three gods.
2.77.15	Which are the Vasus?
2.77.16	Agni, earth, wind, space, sun, heaven, moon, and stars - these are the Vasus.
2.77.17	For everything here is deposited in them.
2.77.18	Therefore, they are called Vasus.
2.77.19	Which are the Rudras?
2.77.20	He said, "The ten vital airs in the body."
2.77.21	The self is the eleventh.
2.77.22	When they depart, they cry out.
2.77.23	Therefore, they are called Rudras.
2.77.24	Which are called Adityas?
2.77.25	He said "The twelve months are the year."
2.77.26	These are the Adityas.
2.77.27	They move forward taking everything.
2.77.28	Therefore, they are called Ādityas.
2.77.29	Which are the three?
2.77.30	These very worlds.
2.77.31	Which are two?
2.77.32	Day and night.
2.77.33	Which is Indra and which is Prajapati?
2.77.34	Speech is Indra and mind is Prajapati.
2.77.35	Which is the one deity?
2.77.36	Breath.
2.77.37	He said, "You have not asked me about the deity that is not to be asked about. You will die before the end of this day."
2.77.38	"Your bodies will not reach your homes."
2.77.39	It happened just as he had said.
2.77.40	He died just as he had predicted.
2.77.41	His relatives, thinking that he was dead, took away his body.
2.77.42	Therefore, one should not speak ill of others.
2.77.43	For he who knows thus becomes supreme.
2.78.1	Brahma and Subrahma were in these worlds, in this world.
2.78.2	Then Subrahma departed.
2.78.3	This sun is Brahma, and speech is Subrahma.
2.78.4	The gods here, in the altar, within the altar, with sacrifice, grasped Brahma.
2.78.5	This is now the Veda, which is enclosed by the altar, and is taken up by the Brahman.
2.78.6	They say, "If the other priests perform the rites within the altar, then how does the Subrahmanya perform them outside the altar?"
2.78.7	He should say, "The altar is the Self, and the Subrahmanya is the visible Brahman.
2.78.8	Whatever is the heap of grass, he calls out to Subrahmaṇyā. By that, it becomes done within the altar.
2.78.9	He says three times, "Subrahmaṇya, Subrahmaṇya."
2.78.10	Subrahmaṇyā is indeed speech.
2.78.11	He begins with that speech.
2.78.12	Brahma is speech, the essence is Oṃkāra.
2.78.13	He delights her with the words, "This is the one Oṃ, Subrahmaṇya."
2.79.1	"Indeed, the breath is foremost, then speech."
2.79.2	But that is not so.
2.79.3	As if one were to sprinkle honey on parched grains, it would be different. That is how it is.
2.79.4	Therefore, one should call out, "Oṃ, Subrahmanya."
2.79.5-13	"Come, O Indra!" He thus invites Indra to the sacrifice. "Come, O Hari!" He thus says to him, "Come to the two Haris." The two Haris are the Prāṇa and Apāna. They are the two that carry everything here. The two Haras are the day and night. They are those that carry everything here.
2.79.14-20	The goat, having become the guest of Medhatithi, drank the king. The goat of Vrusanasvasya was called Mena. Having become Mena, Maghavan dwelt in the family of Vrusanasavas. Having become Gaura, he descended into the ocean. Having become the husband of Ahalya. Having become Ahalya's husband, Maitreya.
2.79.21	Kausika, the Brahman Kausika says thus.
2.79.22	When he fought a great battle with the Asuras, he discarded the Vedas.
2.79.23	He learned them from Vishvamitra.
2.79.24	Then only Kausika said, "Some Brahman Kausika call out to Gautama thus."
2.80.1	It is known that it is only through Aruni that they became famous.
2.80.2	Therefore, one should not have expectations from him.
2.80.3	Therefore, O Kausika, one should call out, "O Kausika, the Brahman!"
2.80.4	The gods and Brahmins come and say, "The gods are coming, the gods are coming!" They invite both the gods and the Brahmins.
2.80.5	Those who are invited by him desire good fortune.
2.80.6-12	Therefore, one should invite him after having consulted him, lest he should censure one. They say, "What is the metre of Subrahmanya?" One should say, "Trishtup." For the Trishtup is connected with Indra. They say: "What deity is Subrahmanya?" One should say, "Indra." For one invokes Indra with this.
2.80.13	Then he should say, 'To the All-gods.'
2.80.14	For she invokes the All-gods with her.
2.80.15	They say, 'If the other Hotr-priests have hymns and prayers, then where is the hymn and prayer for Subrahmanya?'
2.80.16	He should say, 'All the Rk, Saman and Yajus are in this one.
2.80.17	Therefore, this hymn of his becomes endowed with the Subrahmaṇya hymn and the Subrahmaṇa hymn.
2.80.18	They say, "What is it like? Like the Subrahmaņya hymn, like the Sāman, or like the Yajus?"
2.80.19	He should say, "It is neither the Rg, nor the Yajus, nor the Sāman."
2.80.20	It is like everything.
2.80.21	For Brahman is like everything.
2.80.22	Now that which he calls out to at the Subrahmaṇyā when the king has been bought, and which he calls out at the Subrahmanya when the sacrificial fees are being taken away, standing at the Utkara, that is this (Subrahmanya).
2.80.23	Now that which is the going forth, that is the coming in.
2.80.24	Now Indra has come, we shall not call him out.
2.80.25	This indeed is the cow with five calves, with five feet.
2.80.26	Now, they call the animals 'Paṅktis' (rows). That is the same.
2.80.27	Some of them call them according to the deity.
2.80.28	The Agniṣṭoma is entirely dedicated to Agni, the Indraṣṭoma to Indra, the Vaisvadev to all the deities, and the Anirukta to the Aniruktas.
2.80.29	But it is not always so.
2.80.30	For there is no injury to Brahman.
2.80.31	He should call out as he falls. He should call out.
2.81.1	Now this is the Upaśaḍa (rite).
2.81.2	Kashyapa desired, "May my offspring and cattle be near me. May I be born with offspring and cattle."
2.81.3	He saw this sacrifice.
2.81.4	He brought it.
2.81.5	He performed it.
2.81.6	Then indeed, the creatures and cattle were attached to him. He was born with offspring and cattle.
2.81.7	Indeed, the creatures and the cattle are attached to him. One is born with offspring and with cattle, who knows thus.
2.81.8	His Bahispavamāna has three stomas.
2.81.9	The three-stoma is indeed inferior.
2.81.10	Inferior is the generation.
2.81.11	May that which is procreation, may that procreate me.
2.81.12	It has one more Stoma.
2.81.13	From the procreation that is not interrupted, offspring are born.
2.81.14	That which is the one Stoma that is added to each Stotra, that is why it is called Upashada.
2.81.15	It has both kinds of Stoma, odd and even.
2.81.16	This is the divine pair, the begetting of offspring, that both Stoma-s.
2.81.17	"He thinks, 'May that which is the divine pair beget me.'
2.81.18	" Its two Sāman-s are Brhat and Rathantara.
2.81.19	"This is the divine pair that begets offspring, that both Brhat and Rathantara."
2.81.20	That divine pair is the begetting, may it beget me.
2.82.1	The Pavamāna Sāmans are prescribed for the mother of Vasīṣṭha.
2.82.2	This indeed is the divine pair, the begetting, which is the mother of Vasīstha.
2.82.3	That divine pair is the engendering, may it beger me.
2.82.4	His Agniṣṭoma Sāman is of twenty verses.
2.82.5-12	That is Viraj. Food is Viraj. The sacrifice is established at the end of Viraj in food. They say, "The Stoma is not generative. One should not sacrifice with it." But they say, "It is generative." Food is Viraja. From food semen is emitted. From semen offspring are born.
2.82.13	Therefore it is indeed the procreation.
2.82.14	Now they say, one should perform the Aṣṭādaśa, then the Saviṃśa, and then the Ekaviṃśa Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
2.82.15	This is known in the Ekaviṃsa Stoma, the final Stotra is established.
2.82.16	Now this is the verse:
2.82.17	The sun desired, "May I, by means of the Avashāya sacrifice, transcend all evil and ascend to heaven."
2.82.18	He saw this sacrifice.
2.82.19	He brought it.
2.82.20	He performed it.
2.82.21	Then he, by means of Avashāya, transcended all evil and ascended to heaven.
2.82.22	This is the one who shines, having removed all evil.
2.82.23	He who knows this indeed, goes to heaven, leaving behind all evil.
2.82.24	And because he is made to recite each Stotraya, therefore it is called 'shade'.
2.83.1	Now this is the Puna-stoma.
2.83.2	The sage came and was unable to rise up, because of the Asura meal.
2.83.3	The poison entered him, whether he offended his friend or ate the food of his enemies.
2.83.4	He said to Indra, "I am not able to rise."
2.83.5	He saw this sacrifice.
2.83.6	He brought it.
2.83.7	He sacrificed with it.
2.83.8	Its morning pressing is three-fold, the third pressing is three-folded,
2.83.9	The three-fold is deficient. He throws it into the deficient (fire).
2.83.10	He throws it into the two three-fold oblations, as one would throw a shield into the fire from both sides. Thus he removes all his sin.
2.83.11	From here and from there he removes the sin.
2.83.12	He who knows this, indeed, removes sin from above and below.
2.83.13	He became too much emaciated and was unable to rise.
2.83.14	He thought, 'How can I again unite with him?'
2.83.15	He again sacrificed to him with the same (rite).
2.83.16	By that he again united with him.
2.83.17	He again became prosperous.
2.83.18	His midday pressing is the twelfth.
2.83.19	The year has twelve months.
2.83.20	By means of the year he again made his empty self full in the middle.
2.83.21	He was as if he had not taken anything.
2.83.22	As if it were the pain of a two-toothed child, so was his pain.
2.83.23	He who thinks that he is a Gargi, having eaten food of one who does not accept gifts, without accepting gifts, should offer this sacrifice.
2.83.24	By means of these two Trivrt (sacrifices) and the Savanas, he casts the Garga in all directions, both above and below.
2.84.1	His Brihat is the Prstha.
2.84.2	This is the Rathantara, the Brihat is yonder.
2.84.3	The Prariktya is as if near, as if in front.
2.84.4	The Brahma-sāman is sung in the Garas, for the removal of the Garas.
2.84.5	They say, "These were indeed the wish-yielding cows. They took them by this very sacrifice."
2.84.6	His morning pressing is of three stomas, the third pressing is of three, and the midday pressing is of twelve.
2.84.7	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
2.84.8	Cattle are the Jagati, cattle are the wish-yielding cow.
2.84.9	Brahman is the three-stoma.
2.84.10	They took them by surrounding them on both sides with Brahman.
2.84.11	Of them one gives milk to the listener.
2.84.12	They found her on the earth.
2.84.13	They found her in the furrow with the plough, one with trade, one with Brahman, one with the practice of Brahman, one with following the king.
2.84.14	Then those three remaining ones made those very Ukthas.
2.84.15	This is the Ukthya sacrifice.
2.84.16	The Agniṣṭoma is always the first of the Upavasatha sacrifices, and the Agniṣṭoma itself is the last.
2.84.17	One who desires cattle should offer this sacrifice.
2.84.18	At that time both the Brhat and the Rathantara should be performed.
2.84.19	Cattle are indeed of two kinds.
2.84.20	Some are Rathantara, others Brhat.
2.84.21	Those animals which have teeth on one side only are Rāthantara; those which have teeth on both sides are Bārhaspatya.
2.84.22	For the purpose of including all animals.
2.84.23	It is Utkhya; Utkhyas are animals; for the purpose of including animals.
2.85.4	He brought it.
2.85.5	They worshipped with it.
2.85.6	Then indeed they obtained the food of Viraj, and they stood firm in the food of Viraja.
2.85.7	He who knows this obtains the food of Virai, and stands firm in the food Viraj.
2.85.8	He indeed is Viraj, where he does not think of another world.
2.85.9	He conquers it with this.
2.85.10-17	It has ten stotras of three verses each, and three of fifteen verses each. That is Viraj. Those four Virajas are accomplished. Food is Viraj. Viraj is food. For the purpose of attaining food. Its back-verse is Rathantara. This is Rathantara. This is Viraj.
2.85.18	He who takes the most of this (earth) shines.
2.85.19	Food is Viraj.
2.85.20	(It is) for the attainment of food.
2.85.21	"The moon shines over the ocean with its extent." This is the Madhyandina Pavamana, the earth being the Sama.
2.85.22	They thus make the Stoma prosper in its form.
2.86.1	They desired, 'May we, having obtained the food of Viraj, go to the world of self-sovereignty.'
2.86.2	They saw this sacrifice of self-sovereignity.
2.86.3	They brought it.
2.86.4	They performed it.
2.86.5	Then indeed they, having obtained the Viraj food, went to the world of Self-sovereignty.
2.86.6	He who knows thus goes to the world of Viraj food and self-sovereignty.
2.86.7	He indeed is the self-sovereign, where he does not think of the world of another.
2.86.8	He conquers that very one.
2.86.9	It has ten stotras of three verses each.
2.86.10	Those are the three Virajas.
2.86.11	The fifteenth and seventeenth are two.
2.86.12	That is the Anushtup.
2.86.13	This indeed is the self sovereignty of the metres, the world which is attained by the Anushtups.
2.86.14	Prajapati is the Anushtubh.
2.86.15	Prajapati is the king of himself.
2.86.16	Food is indeed Viraj.
2.86.17	Having established himself in Viraj, in food, he went to the world of kingly power.
2.86.18	He who knows this goes to the world of Viraj, of kingly power, having established himself in Virajj, in food.
2.86.19	His back is Brihat.
2.86.20	Brihat is indeed here.
2.86.21	Kingly power is indeed here.
2.86.22	By this he went to the world of self-sovereignty.
2.86.23	He who knows this goes to the world of Svarga.
2.86.24	The moon shines over the ocean, this is said in the Pavamāna of the Ādiṣṭa Sāman. It becomes one with the Sāman of the heaven.
2.86.25	For this world is indeed below.
2.86.26	They increase the Stoma by its form.
2.86.27	And when it is one-syllabled, it is for not going beyond the world of heaven.
2.87.1	Now this is the bull.
2.87.2	Indra desired, "May I be the bull of all creatures, may I attain bullhood."
2.87.3	He saw this sacrifice.
2.87.4	He brought it.
2.87.5	He performed it.
2.87.6	Then he became the bull of all creatures and attained the status of a bull.
2.87.7	One who knows this becomes the bull of his own creatures and attains the status of a cow.
2.87.8	That bull is indeed prosperity.
2.87.9	He attained prosperity.
2.87.10	The bull is indeed the king of humans.
2.87.11	The bull (is) the bull of animals.
2.87.12	The bull is the leader of the bulls.
2.87.13	The he-goat is the leader of goats.
2.87.14	The heifer is the leader of sheep.
2.87.15	The black bull is the leader among cows.
2.87.16	The bull is the leader in the red cows.
2.87.17	These are indeed the leaders of the cows.
2.87.18	He who knows this goes to prosperity.
2.87.19	It becomes fifteenfold.
2.87.20	The fifteenfold is the thunderbolt.
2.87.21	Indra is the thunderbolt.
2.87.22	This sacrifice is Indra's, and it is performed with its characteristics.
2.87.23	His midday (rite) consists of twenty-one (verses).
2.87.24	That is his Kakub.
2.87.25	Those who are the best of these worlds, they are the Kakub.
2.87.26	Agni is the Kakub of this world, Vayu of the sky, Aditya of heaven.
2.87.27	He who knows this, becomes one with the Kakub.
2.87.28	His Brihat (Sāman) is large.
2.87.29	Indra is large.
2.87.30	The Prsthas are prosperity.
2.87.31	They indeed prosper Indra with prosperity.
2.87.32	The two Pavamānas, namely, the Rishabha and the Rishabha Vaidnavata, are prescribed for him.
2.87.33	They indeed make the Stoma prosper in its form.
2.88.1	Now this is the Vyoman.
2.88.2	The gods desired, 'May we be in the sky, may we go to the world of the sky.'
2.88.3	They saw this sacrifice.
2.88.4	They brought it.
2.88.5	They performed it.
2.88.6	Then indeed they became in the sky, they went to the world of sky.
2.88.7	One indeed becomes in the sky, goes to the world of heaven, who knows thus.
2.88.8	He indeed becomes in the heaven, where he does not think of the world of others.
2.88.9	He conquers with this very one.
2.88.10	It is of seventeen verses.
2.88.11	Prajapati is seventeen.
2.88.12	Prajapti is the sky.
2.88.13	"He goes to the sky, to the sky-like world, by the sky."
2.88.14	Both the Brihat and Rathantara are its Samas.
2.88.15	For there is no sky in either of them.
2.88.16	Both of them are sky.
2.88.17	We go to the world of the sky by the sky, by the sky.
2.88.18	His twenty-one-fold Pavamāna becomes the Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
2.88.19	Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun is the twenty-first.
2.88.20	Indeed, these are the sky-dwellers, the gods who are below Prajapati. They
2.88.21	"We go to the world of the sky by the sky, by the sky."
2.88.22	These two are the prescribed Sāman songs for the Pavamāna Stotras.
2.88.23	They thus make the Stoma prosper in its form.
2.89.1	Now these two are Udbhid and Valabhid.
2.89.2	One desiring progeny should offer these two sacrifices.
2.89.3	The Stoma is three and fifteen, seven and seventeen.
2.89.4	The two are deficient and excessive, the two are generative.
2.89.5	One is deficient, the other is excessive.
2.89.6	From the deficient and excessive pair, offspring and cattle are born.
2.89.7	That is the generative act.
2.89.8	Therefore one who desires offspring should offer with both.
2.89.9	Now they say, one should offer with these two for the sake of acquiring brahmic glory.
2.89.10	Of these two, one attains six Gāyatrī verses, and the other attains six.
2.89.11	Brahma is Gāyatrī.
2.89.12	These two sacrifices attain Gāyatrī
2.89.13	Therefore, one who desires brahmic glory should offer with both.
2.89.14	Then they say, one should offer with these two for the sake of longevity.
2.89.15	The Gayatri is indeed the breath.
2.89.16	These two sacrifices are accomplished in the Gayatri.
2.89.17	Therefore, one who desires longevity should offer with both.
2.89.18	Then they say, one who desires brilliance should offer with these.
2.89.19	The Gayatra is indeed brilliance.
2.89.20	These two are accomplished in the Gāyatrī.
2.89.21	Therefore, one who desires brilliance should offer with both.
2.89.22	Some say: One who desires heaven should offer with both,
2.89.23	For the six Gāyatrī verses are the four Brhatī verses.
2.89.24	The Brhatī verse led to the heavenly world.
2.89.25	Therefore, one who desires heaven should make offerings with both.
2.89.26	Others say: One who wishes for cattle should make offerings with them.
2.90.5	This is the Trivṛt and Pañcadaśa stoma, with Rāthantera and Utsad Brāhmaṇas.
2.90.6	This is the Udbhid stoma, with Saptadaśa and Saptas, with Brhat and Niṣedha Brāhmaṇās.
2.90.7	Just as a sharp spike or a peg, so is this Trivṛt stoma.
2.90.8	Just as one would strike with a sharp stake or a wedge, having first fixed it with a three-fold Stoma, so he struck with the thunderbolt of fifteen verses.
2.90.9	They also say that this is Agni himself, the three-fold Stotra;
2.90.10	and this is the thunderbolt, the fifteen-fold.
2.90.11	Just as one would break a stone with a hammer after heating it with fire, in the same way, having heated the strength with this three-fold Agni Stoma, he breaks it with the fifteen-fold thunderbolt.
2.90.12	They remained there itself, not finding a way.
2.90.13	They broke it with the very Utsahedha.
2.90.14	Now this is the Udbhit, consisting of seven and seventeen. It is said:
2.90.15	Then those seven are the seven animals, and those seventeen are the seventeen Prajapati.
2.90.16	They saw their father, Prajapati, and rejoiced, and rose up.
2.90.17	And when they rose up, they emitted a great sound.
2.90.18	The gods were afraid of them, and were afraid of them.
2.90.19	They (the gods) established themselves by means of the Utsiddha and the Nisiddha.
2.90.20	He who desires cattle should offer these two.
2.90.21	By means of the Valabhid he breaks the power, by means of the Udhib he releases the cattle.
2.90.22	By means means of the Utsiddha and the Nididdha he establishes himself and obtains cattle. He obtains many cattle.
2.91.1	Now these two, Satrajit and Pritanajit.
2.91.2	The gods and the Asuras contended with Prajapati in the year and in these worlds.
2.91.3	The gods desired, "May we conquer the army."
2.91.4	They saw this sacrifice, the conqueror of the army.
2.91.5	They brought it.
2.91.6	They performed it.
2.91.7	Then they conquered that army.
2.91.8	He who conquered the army is Pṛtanājit. The conquest of the army is Prtanājit.
2.91.9	He who knows this conquers the army and his enemies.
2.91.10	It consists of twenty-four verses.
2.91.11	The year consists of twenty-two and a half fortnights.
2.91.12	They conquered it by the year.
2.91.13	Its Rathantara is the background.
2.91.14	This is the Rathantara.
2.91.15	From that very world they conquered them.
2.91.16	It has twelve hymns.
2.91.17	The year has twelve months.
2.91.18	They conquered them from the year itself.
2.91.19	It has twenty-four hymns and praises.
2.91.20	The year consists of twenty-four half-months.
2.91.21	They conquered them in half a month, and thus they conquered them in a year.
2.92.1	Those conquered ones resorted to their father Prajapati, who is twenty-five, and to this world.
2.92.2	They desired, "We will conquer them by means of a sacrifice."
2.92.3	They saw this sacrifice called "Conqueror of Sacrifice."
2.92.4	They brought it.
2.92.5	They performed it.
2.92.6	It conquered them.
2.92.7	He who knows this is the conqueror of the sacrifice.
2.92.8	He who knows this conquers his enemies in the sacrifice.
2.92.9	It becomes twenty-five.
2.92.10	The year consists of twenty-four and a half months.
2.92.11	Prajapati is twenty-five. He is the conqueror of sacrifice.
2.92.12	They conquered him from the year, from Prajapati.
2.92.13	It has twelve hymns.
2.92.14	Twelve months make a year.
2.92.15	They conquered it by means of the months.
2.92.16	It has twenty-four hymns and eulogies.
2.92.17	Twenty-four half-months make a year. They conquered it by means
2.92.18	of the half-months.
2.92.19	Then indeed the gods became victorious over the Asuras.
2.92.20	He who knows this becomes victorious over his own self, and his enemy becomes defeated.
2.93.1	They say: Prajapati, desiring offspring, saw this sacrifice called Prtanajit.
2.93.2	He brought it.
2.93.3	They say one should perform it.
2.93.4	It has two hundred and eighty hymns.
2.93.5	That is deficient.
2.93.6	The generation is from the lesser.
2.93.7	For from the woman there are two less than that from which she is generated.
2.93.8	That is the generation that is done.
2.93.9	It becomes twenty-four.
2.93.10	The year is twenty-four half-months.
2.93.11	The generation is done in the year.
2.93.12	It has twelve praises.
2.93.13	The year has twelve months.
2.93.14	The generation (is done) in the year.
2.93.15	That is the generation.
2.93.16	And there are twenty-four hymns and praises for it.
2.93.17	The year has twenty-four half-months.
2.93.18	The year is generation.
2.93.19	That is the generation, which is done in succession.
2.93.20	He who knows this is born with offspring and cattle.
2.93.21	They desired, "May my offspring be ninety."
2.93.22	He saw this sacrifice of Satrājit.
2.93.23	He brought it.
2.93.24	He performed it.
2.93.25	It is of twenty-five (verses).
2.93.26	The year consists of twenty-four and a half months.
2.93.27	Food is of twenty-four (verses).
2.93.28	He gave food to him by means of the twenty-five (verse).
2.93.29	Of it there are three hundred Stotriya (verses).
2.93.30	It is Viraj.
2.93.31	This is the food of Viraj. He gave this food to them.
2.93.32	These became his hundred and one offspring.
2.93.33	He who desires, "May I beget many offspring and cattle, and may these my offspring not be few," should offer with these two.
2.93.34	He indeed begets many offspring and cattle. His offspring become many.
2.94.1	Now this is the Viraṭ-svarāja (sacrifice).
2.94.2	These two brothers should offer sacrifice with this sacrifice.
2.94.3	Those who desire that one should not go to the kingdom and the other to self-sovereignty, he indeed attains both Viraṭ and Anushtubh.
2.94.4	This indeed is the kingdom, namely Viraṭ.
2.94.5	And this is self-sovereignty - Anushtubh.
2.94.6	The younger one goes to the kingdom of Viraj, the elder one to the kingdom of Svarajya.
2.94.7	His two Sāmans are Bṛhat and Rathantara.
2.94.8	This indeed is the kingdom, namely, Rathantara.
2.94.9	And this is the kingdom of Svarājyā, namely, Bṛhat.
2.94.10	The younger one goes to kingdom with Rathantara.
2.94.11	The elder one goes to the world of Svarājyya with Bṛhat. 
2.94.12-14	His three Stotras are of three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, fifteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one, twenty-three, twenty-five, twenty-seven, twenty-nine, thirty-one, thirty-three, thirty-five, thirty-seven, thirty-nine, forty-one, forty-three, forty-five, forty-seven, forty-nine, fifty-one, fifty-three, fifty-five, fifty-seven, fifty-nine, sixty-one, sixty-three, sixty-five, sixty-seven, sixty-nine, seventy-one, seventy-three, seventy-five, seventy-seven, seventy-nine, eighty-one, eighty-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-nine, ninety-one, ninety-three, ninety-five, ninety-seven, ninety-nine, one hundred and one, one hundred and three, one hundred and five, one hundred and seven, one hundred and nine, one hundred and eleven, one hundred and thirteen, one hundred and fifteen, one hundred and seventeen, one hundred and nineteen, one hundred and twenty-one, one hundred and twent-three, one hundred and tenty-five, one hundred and seventy-seven, one hundred and ninety-nine, two hundred and one, two hundred and three, two hundred and five, two hundred and seven, two hundred and nine, two hundred and eleven, two hundred and thirteen, two hundred and fifteen, two hundred and seventeen, two hundred and nineteen, two hundred and twenty- one, two hundred twenty-three, two hundred and twentv-five, two hundred and seventy- seven, two hundred ninety-nine, three hundred and one, three hundred and three,
2.95.1	They say that this sacrifice is for the existent, not for the non-existent; the Stoma is not generative. The Viraj and the Anushtubh are united.
2.95.2	The Viraj is like a complete, generative (verse).
2.95.3	The Anushtubh is the end of the metres.
2.95.4	They say that this sacrifice is for both the existent and the non-existent.
2.95.5	Its stomas are three, five, fifteen, seventeen, twenty-one, less and more, pairs, procreators.
2.95.6	One is less, the other is more.
2.95.7	From the less and more, from the pair, offspring and cattle are born.
2.95.8	The Trivṛt and Pañcadaśa are the pair, the begetting.
2.95.9	The Saptadaśa and Ekavimśa are the couple, the begetting,
2.95.10	That which is the couple, the engendering, may that engender me.
2.95.11	Now, when the two Sāman-tunes, the Brihat and the Rathantara, are used, it is because the divine pair, the procreator, is that, namely, the Brihat (Sāman) and the Rathantara. Therefore, he thinks, 'May the divine pair, procreator, generate me.'
2.95.12	For, having killed, one becomes the most procreative by approaching the Viraj.
2.95.13	The Viraj is food.
2.95.14	From eating, semen is emitted.
2.95.15	From semen are born the creatures.
2.95.16	And because it is united with the Anushtubh (metre), Prajapati is Anushtubh, Prajapati is generation. May he who is generation generate me.'
2.96.1	'You two are indeed the lords of heaven.' This is the appropriate verse to be recited.
2.96.2	This is the appropriate verse for two persons offering a sacrifice together.
2.96.3	They say, "Do you sing to him, O Vāc, the foremost, the best." These two are the Pratipada.
2.96.4	These two are the Prāṭipadā for the two who are performing the sacrifice together.
2.96.5	And both the Sāmans are performed here.
2.96.6	Therefore these two are the Prātipadā.
2.96.7	In that (Sāman) they arrange these two Sāmans, the Gāyatra and the Ārbhava, the two Sāmans of the horse-sacrifice, the two Sāmans of the two sacrificers.
2.96.8	Those two Sāmans which are the two Sāman-s of the two sacrificer-s.
2.96.9	They make the Virāṭsvarāja (Sāman), the Pavamāna (Sāman of the Ārbhava) in Anushtubh (metre).
2.96.10	For this sacrifice is Virāṭsvara.
2.96.11	They increase the Stoma.
2.97.1	Now this is the Jyesthaya (sacrifice).
2.97.2	One who desires to be the eldest should offer this sacrifice.
2.97.3	It consists of eight and twenty-one (bricks).
2.97.4	Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun are twenty-one.
2.97.5	This indeed is the foremost position of the eldest.
2.97.6	He who is the foremost, he should go to the foremost.
2.97.7	There are seventeen Pavamāna verses.
2.97.8	Prajapati is seventeenfold.
2.97.9	Prajapate is the foremost.
2.97.10	He who is the foremost should go to the forefront.
2.97.11	Its hymns are those of the Uttara-Avants.
2.97.12	They thus lead him to the northern prosperity, to the northern heaven.
2.97.13	Its Brhat is the back.
2.97.14	Prosperity is the Brhat, seniority.
2.97.15	The Brhat is here, seniority is here.
2.97.16	They thus establish him in the middle of prosperity, in seniority.
2.97.17	There are twelve hymns for him.
2.97.18	Twelve months are a year.
2.97.19	The year is the foremost of the seasons.
2.97.20	He who is the foremost of seasons, he should go to the foremost of seasons.
2.97.21	There are twenty-four hymns and praises for him.
2.97.22	Twenty-four half-months are a year.
2.97.23	The year is the foremost of the seasons.
2.97.24	He who wants to be the foremost of the foremost should offer this sacrifice.
2.97.25	He who is the eldest and the most deserving should offer this sacrifice if he wants to be the most deserving. He goes to the foremost and does not fall from the foremost.
2.98.1	Now this is the sacrifice for the one who is in a bad condition.
2.98.2	Having offered the oblation of the full-moon, he offers a rice-cake to Aditya.
2.98.3	In it he gives a hundred-weight of gold and silver to the Moon in the afternoon.
2.98.4	In it, he gives a hundred weight of silver.
2.98.5	Thus he performs these two rites of the morning and afternoon in this dark fortnight.
2.98.6	The Soma-sacrifice is performed on the new-moon day, after the consecration.
2.98.7	This is indeed the course of the Sun and the Moon.
2.98.8	The Sun and the Moon desired: "We shall attain the same sacrifice and the same prosperity."
2.98.9	One of them should not conquer the day, the other the night.
2.98.10	They saw this sacrifice.
2.98.11	They brought it.
2.98.12	Therefore he performed the sacrifice.
2.98.13	Then they both attained the same prosperity by the same sacrifice.
2.98.14	One of them conquered the day, the other the night.
2.98.15	This is their common prosperity, that one who performs the sacrifice in the morning and afternoon attains the same world.
2.98.16	The morning is the day, the evening is the night; for the conquest of day and night.
2.98.17	He performs the rites of the two fortnights, the bright and the dark.
2.98.18	The bright fortnight is the day, and the dark fortnight is the night; (it is done) for the conquest of the day and night. The rites are performed in the order of the two fortnlights.
2.98.19	They are performed in the manner of a hundred.
2.98.20	Man has a life of a hundred years, a hundred senses, and a hundred powers; (it is performed) for the attainment of those senses and powers.
2.99.1-7	The Stoma is seventeenfold. Prajapati is seventeenfold. Prajapati is the performer of the heavenly world. He may attain the heavenly world. Thus it is said. His fee is a hundred bulls. Man has a hundred years of life, a hundred senses, and a hundred powers. For the attainment of those very senses and powers, All fires are used.
2.99.8	For Agni goes where he wishes to go.
2.99.9	All the boons are obtained.
2.99.10	As if heaven is a boon, for the prosperity of heaven.
2.99.11	One who gives this should give seventeen gold coins at each praise.
2.99.12	The gods and the demons competed in the sacrifice.
2.99.13	Whatever the gods did in the sacrifice, the Asuras followed them.
2.99.14	The gods said: Whatever we do in the sacrifice, that the Asuras follow us.
2.99.15	Let us perform a sacrifice with gold and Soma.
2.99.16	Then at that time there was gold among the gods, not among the Asuras.
2.99.17	The gods, having bound the gold of the Asuras,
2.99.18	performed a sacrifice with gold and Soma.
2.99.19	At every praise they gave seventeen seventeen gold pieces.
2.99.20	The Asuras did not obtain it.
2.99.21	They said, "Indeed the gods have done a bad deed."
2.99.22	That itself is the badness of the bad deed.
2.99.23	Then indeed the gods became victorious over the Asuras.
2.99.24	He who knows this becomes victorious over his own self, and his enemy becomes defeated.
2.99.25	The Sukra and Chandra Sāman are prescribed for the Pavamāna Stotras.
2.99.26	For this sacrifice belongs to the Sun and the Moon.
2.99.27	They indeed make the Stoma prosper in its form.
2.100.1	Now this is the Apaciti.
2.100.2	Prajapati created the creatures.
2.100.3	Those created by him did not honour him.
2.100.4	He desired, 'May I obtain honour among the created beings.'
2.100.5	He saw this sacrifice.
2.100.6	He brought it.
2.100.7	He performed it.
2.100.8	Then they honoured him.
2.100.9	The gods did not honour Indra.
2.100.10	He approached Prajapati, saying, 'The gods do not honour me.'
2.100.11	Therefore he established this sacrifice of atonement.
2.100.12	He brought it.
2.100.13	He performed it.
2.100.14	Then the gods atoned for him.
2.100.15	The Pancalas, indeed, did not atone for King Satani of Darbha.
2.100.16	Even the princes would call him "Darbha, Darbha".
2.100.17	Now there were two Brahmanas who were his friends, Aśvatthi and Kesi Satyakami.
2.100.18	They approached him.
2.100.19	He sat down meditating.
2.100.20	They said to him,
2.100.21	"What is the king meditating on?"
2.100.22	He said, "I do not meditate.
2.100.23	The Panchala kings, though they are my own, do not honour me. Even the young boys call me 'Darbha, Darbha'.
2.100.24	This is what I am thinking about.
2.100.25	He said, 'There is a sacrifice called Apaciti. We shall perform that for you.'
2.100.26	'So be it.'
2.100.27	They performed that sacrifice for him.
2.100.28	He went to the Panchala country and became so famous that even today the grass is called 'darbha' (sacred grass) in that country.
2.101.1	The morning pressing is completed with the Gayatri metre, the midday pressing with the Tristubh metre and the third pressing with the Jagati metre.
2.101.2	Now, when the morning Savana is completed with the Gayatri, the Gayatri has eight syllables, the Vasus are eight, and by that very metre, Prajapati and Indra went to the Apicit place among the Vasus in the morning Savana.
2.101.3	Now, when the Madhyandina pressing became the Tristubh, the Tristubh has eleven syllables, the Rudras are eleven, and by means of the Tristubh metre Prajapati and Indra went to the share in the Madhyandina Sawan among the gods, the Rudras.
2.101.4	Now, when the Jagati becomes the third pressing, the Jagati has twelve syllables, the Adityas are twelve, Prajapati and Indra went to the third pressing in the gods, the Adityan, by means of the Jagati metre.
2.101.5	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
2.101.6	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
2.101.7	The Jagati has twelve.
2.101.8	"Speech" is the concluding verse of the Yajayajniya.
2.101.9	That is thirty-two.
2.101.10	Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
2.101.11	Anushtup is the metre of all the gods.
2.101.12	Prajapati and Indra, by means of the Anushtubh metre, attained supremacy over all the gods at the third pressing.
2.101.13	There are so many gods.
2.101.14	There are as many classes of gods.
2.101.15	And they went to him for atonement.
2.102.1	The Brāhmaṇa was Gāyatrī,
2.102.2	the Rājanya was Trisṭubh,
2.102.3	the Vaiśya was Jagatī,
2.102.4	and the Śūdra was Anuṣṭubh.
2.102.5	Now when the morning pressing is completed with the Gāyatrī verse, then the Brāhmaṇa Darbha Śātānikiri went to him for atone- ment.
2.102.6	Now, when the midday pressing is completed with the Tristubh (metre), it is with the Tristubb metre itself that Darbha Sataniiki, the royal man, attained to prosperity.
2.102.7	And when the third pressing is completed with Jagati (metre), it was with the Jagati metre itself that Darba Sataniiki, a Vaishya man, attained to prosperit.
2.102.8	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
2.102.9	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
2.102.10	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
2.102.11	"The word "vāg" is the concluding verse of the Yajñāyajñiya hymn."
2.102.12	That makes thirty-two.
2.102.13	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
2.102.14	The Anushthubh is the metre of the Shudra.
2.102.15	By means of the Anushthubha metre, Shaataniiki Darbha, a Shudra, attained prosperity among humans.
2.102.16	These are the human beings.
2.102.17	These are the human races.
2.102.18	He went to the end of them.
2.103.1	They say, "What is the support and the completion of this sacrifice?"
2.103.2	He should say, "Whatever does not match from one pressing to another,
2.103.3	whatever does not match becomes complete, that is the support and completion of this sacrifice."
2.103.4	They say that the verse "He shines forth, he shines forth" should be used as the first verse.
2.103.5	This is the verse "Gani" (the one who has many forms).
2.103.6	Those who attain prosperity are attended by many like a group.
2.103.7	They say that the verses "Flow forth, O speech, the foremost, let us praise him, O men" should be used. These are the two verses.
2.103.8	These two are the verses "Gani" and "Bahurūpa".
2.103.9	Now, both the Sāman-s are performed here.
2.103.10	Therefore, these two alone should be performed.
2.103.11	They are in the Brihat and Rathantara tunes.
2.103.12	Rathantara is Brahman, Brihat is Kshatra.
2.103.13	Brahman and Kshatra are the two forms.
2.103.14	They are Bhadra and Sreya.
2.103.15	The gods became prosperous by Bhadra and Sreyas, and attained prosperity.
2.103.16-24	May you be with the power of the sun. The gods overcame the Asuras with force. With power, they became powerful. May you be with the glory of the sun. With the glory, the gods became glorious. With fame, they attained fame. May you have the power to rise and the power to restrain. With the power to rise, the gods rose up. With the restraining power, they restrained.
2.103.25	You are the one who makes the assembly and the assembly of people.
2.103.26	The gods settled in the assembly with the one who makes assemblies.
2.103.27	The kings of the assembly became the assembly of people with the one who assembles the assembly of people
2.103.28	You are the one who establishes and transgresses the law.
2.103.29	The gods became the law with the law.
2.103.30	They destroyed the transgression of the law with the transgression of the 
2.103.31	In that (Sāman) both the groups of two-footed verses are used, the highest and the shortest metres.
2.103.32	The metres are indeed cattle.
2.103.33	Therefore, all cattle, the highest and shortest, stand around it.
2.103.34	All cattle, the highest as well as the shortest, stand around him who knows this.
2.103.35	His chariot with four horses and a parasol is the fee.
2.103.36	All the horses are of the king of heaven.
2.103.37	He becomes the sun, adorned with all ornaments.
2.103.38	His retinue consists of tigers, elephants, bows, and hawks.
2.103.39	He is armed with a sword and armour, and is equipped with a chariot, a well-equipped charioteer, and a shield, and is protected by two (others).
2.103.40	The garland-holder becomes the one who is without a garland.
2.103.41	This is indeed the form of the sun, this is the form of the Apaciti.
2.103.42	In that (Agni) he gives the wealth of Apaciti. He gives the wealth of the Apacita.
2.103.43	He gives the wealth of those who are without wealth.
2.103.44	They indeed make the Stoma prosper in its form.
2.104.1	Now these two, Abhibhū and Vinutti.
2.104.2	The gods and the Asuras competed.
2.104.3	Those gods desired, 'May we be superior to the Asuras.'
2.104.4	They saw this Abhihu sacrifice.
2.104.5	They brought it.
2.104.6	They performed it.
2.104.7	By it they overcame the Asuras.
2.104.8	Because they overcame, it is Abhihu.
2.104.9	He who knows thus overcomes his enemies.
2.104.10	On both sides of it are the three-fold (bricks).
2.104.11	Brahma is three-fold.
2.104.12	By Brahma they conquered them.
2.104.13	He who knows this conquers his enemy by Brahma.
2.104.14	They, being conquered, resorted to the thirty-first father, Prajapati.
2.104.15	Just as they were being restrained in the city of Jyestha, the best, so they desired them, saying, "We should drive them away."
2.104.16	They saw this sacrifice as a means of driving them away.
2.104.17	They brought it.
2.104.18	They performed it.
2.104.19	Then they drove them away.
2.104.20	Because they drove them away, it is called Vinuttit (the means of driving away).
2.104.21	He who knows this indeed pushes away his hateful enemy.
2.104.22	In the middle of it are two verses of three feet.
2.104.23	Brahma is indeed three-footed.
2.104.24	They indeed pushed him away with Brahma.
2.104.25	He who knows this indeed drives away his hateful enemy with Brahma.
2.105.1	And they say, "This indeed is Agni, the three-footed Stoma;
2.105.2	Just as one would cook them in a fire, so they cooked them with the Trivrt Agni stoma and the Trayastrimsa stoma on both sides.
2.105.3	They approached this world after having destroyed it.
2.105.4	Then indeed the gods became victorious.
2.105.5	He who knows this becomes the conqueror of his enemies.
2.105.6	They say, one should offer this sacrifice for the sake of a Purodha.
2.105.7	The two sacrifices are performed with the Trivrt and Trayastrimsa stoma.
2.105.8	Brahma is Trivrt, and Ksatra is Trayastrimsa.
2.105.9	Brahma alone encloses the Kshatra on both sides.
2.105.10	When Brahma encloses the Kshtra, then he goes to be his Purohita.
2.105.11	He goes to be the Purohita, he places him in front.
2.105.12	They also say, "One should perform this sacrifice for one who desires the last stage, because it is a sacrifice for one who is going to die."
2.105.13	In it, the Trivrt and Trayastrimsa stomas are in the middle, and the Jyotis and Antaryama stomas are on both sides.
2.105.14	Brahma is three-fold, the Kshatra is thirty-three.
2.105.15	He thus encloses Brahma on both sides with the Kshatra.
2.105.16	When he encloses Brahma with the Kshatras, then it stands at the end of it.
2.105.17	It stands at the end, not at the end of the end.
2.105.18	And they say, "The two Stoma-kings are called the two kings."
2.106.1-6	The two Trivṛt and Trayastriṃśa are on either side of the Abhibu, and the Trayastriṃsa is in the middle. There are sixty-six Stotriyas in them. The sixty are the couch. The four couch-feet are the four. The two are the sacrificer, he has two feet. He who knows this goes to the kingdom when he mounts this royal couch.
2.106.7	If in this world or in the other world.
2.106.8	They also say that he who has these two Trivrit (verses) in the middle, in the middle, is indeed like a couch.
2.106.9	The couch is indeed bent in the middle.
2.106.10	This (verse) is indeed bent in its middle.
2.106.11	That (verse) is the most excellent which is bent in the middle,
2.106.12	He goes to the kingdom who knows thus: if in this world or if in the other world.
2.106.13	Then they say, "This is the same sacrifice again."
2.106.14	There are six of them, and the Stotras rise upward.
2.106.15	There are six from there, and six downward. With six he goes upward to heaven, and with six he descends downward. He goes to heaven and stands in this world.
2.106.16	Then indeed he knows, 'He who was that, that am I.' Then indeed he is born again in this world.
2.106.17	And they say, 'He who desires heaven should offer these two.'
2.107.1	These two are together three-fold, together fifteen-fold, together seventeen-fold, together twenty-one-fold, together thirty-three-fold.
2.107.2	Just as one would go forward by two steps, so does he go forward to the heavenly world by these two.
2.107.3	Some say: These two are the sacrificial rites of the Anvīṣṭi.
2.107.4	One who would perform a sacrifice with a fire kindled for a year or less than a year should perform it by these two.
2.107.5	Then indeed his (sacrifice) is determined by the year, by the seasons, by the months, by the half-months.
2.107.6	Now, why the Stotras of the six-day Pañcadaśa sacrifice are (arranged) in ascending order, the Pañcadaśas are the seasons,
2.107.7	and the year is the seasons, therefore (it is arranged) by the seasons.
2.107.8	And why there are twelve Stotras, the year has twelve months, therefore (it) is by the months.
2.107.9	Now, as to why there are twenty-four hymns and praises, it is because the year consists of twenty-four half-months.
2.107.10	He who knows this, his year is immediately fulfilled.
2.108.1	Now, this is the hymn in praise of Manu.
2.108.2	Manu desired: "May I beget many offspring and cattle, may I create offspring of Manu."
2.108.3	He saw this sacrifice.
2.108.4	He brought it.
2.108.5	He performed it.
2.108.6	Then indeed he was born with many offspring and cattle.
2.108.7	He created these human beings.
2.108.8	One who desires, "May I be born with many offspring, cattle, and may I create human beings," should perform this sacrifice.
2.108.9	He begets many offspring and cattle, he creates offspring of men.
2.108.10	The Stotras of that six-day Prsthya sacrifice are as follows:
2.108.11	The Prstha days are the seasons.
2.108.12	The seasons are the year.
2.108.13	The year is procreation.
2.108.14	He who is procreation may he procreate me.
2.108.15	In it both kinds of Stotras are performed, the odd and the even.
2.108.16	That divine pair is the begetting of offspring, that is why there are two Stoma-s.
2.108.17	"That divine pair is the generating of offspring, may it generate me."
2.108.18	Its Stoma-s are alternating, for from the alternating pair offspring and cattle are born.
2.108.19	It has both the Brihat and Rathantara Saman.
2.108.20	This is the divine pair, the begetting, that is, the Brihat and the Rathantara.
2.108.21	"He thinks, "May it beget me, that is the divine pair and the begetting."
2.108.22	Its Pavamana Stotras are the Chandomas.
2.108.23	The Chandomas are cattle.
2.108.24	Cattle are begetting.
2.108.25	"He (the sacrificer) thinks, "May that beget me, which is begetting."
2.108.26	His Brahman-sāman is in the manner of a human being.
2.108.27	Brahman is the Brahman-sāma.
2.108.28	This is the desire of the sacrificer, that the Brahman-sāmā is in his own place, and they satisfy the sacrificer with desires.
2.108.29	It becomes Ukthya.
2.108.30	The Ukthas are offspring and cattle.
2.108.31	Offspring and cattle are procreation.
2.108.32	May that which is procreation generate me.
2.109.1	Now they say, "This is the only sacrifice of the seekers."
2.109.2	He who would offer with a fire kindled for a year or not for a year should offer with this.
2.109.3	Immediately his year becomes sought after, by seasons, by half-months, by months, by nights.
2.109.4	Now, the reason why the Stotras of the six-day Pañcadaśa sacrifice are so arranged is that the Pañcadaśas are the seasons, and the year is the seasons. Thus it is in accordance with the seasons.
2.109.5	Now, the reason why there are fifteen Stotras is that there are fifteen nights in a half-month. Thus it is according to the half-months.
2.109.6	Now, there are thirty Stotras and Sastras because there are thirty nights in a month. Thus it is by months.
2.109.7	Now, when there are three hundred and sixty Stotriya verses, there are so many nights in a year, thus it is by nights.
2.109.8	He whose knowledge is thus, his year is indeed found out immediately.
2.109.9	She desired to go to the heavenly world.
2.109.10	She saw this northern Manu-stoma.
2.109.11	She brought it.
2.109.12	She performed sacrifice with it.
2.109.13-16	The Stotras of that six-day Prsthya sacrifice are the seasons. The Prsthya sacrifices are the seasons. The seasons are the year. The year is the heavenly world. For the attainment of the heavenly world. Its Stotras are ascending. The heavenly world is ascending. For the attainment of the heavenly world.
2.109.17	Its two Sāmans are Bṛhat and Rathantara, for heaven, for the attainment of heaven.
2.109.18	Its Pavamāna Sāmans are the Chandomas, for cattle are the Chandomās.
2.109.19	Cattle are heaven, for the attainmentof heaven.
2.109.20	Its Brahma-sāman is the Pañcaviṃśa.
2.109.21	The Pañcavimsa is food.
2.109.22	This is the desire of the sacrificer, that is, the Brahman-sāman.
2.109.23	They thus satisfy the sacrificer with food in his own abode.
2.109.24	It becomes a Ukthya (sāman). The Ukthyas are offspring and cattle.
2.109.25	Offspring and cattle are heaven, for the attainment of heaven.
2.110.1	Some say, "This is the only sacrifice among the sacrifices."
2.110.2	Then they spend the night.
2.110.3	By means of the Atiratra, the gods went upward to the heavenly world.
2.110.4	Having gone to the heavenly world, they remained together without any disagreement.
2.110.5	Not knowing the directions, they desired, "May we know the directions."
2.110.6	Beyond the day and night is the heavenly world.
2.110.7	They saw four hymns above the night.
2.110.8	They praised them.
2.110.9	Having praised them, they understood the directions.
2.110.10	Then wherever they desired heaven, they went there.
2.110.11	Wherever one desires heaven, one goes there. One who knows this, says Janashrutiya.
2.110.12	Then indeed Vaitehavya said:
2.110.13	Prajapati created the animals.
2.110.14	They fled from him when created.
2.110.15	He pursued them with the Agniṣṭoma.
2.110.16	They fled beyond that.
2.110.17	He pursued with the Ukthya.
2.110.18	They fled beyong that.
2.110.19	He pursuded with the Ṣoḍaśī.
2.110.20	They fled right beyond that.
2.110.21	He went through them one by one.
2.110.22	That he went through them one after the other is the reason why they are called 'pariyāyas'.
2.110.23	He took them in with the Aśvinī sacrifice.
2.110.24	Those that were taken in, just as small fish fall from the dice-box, so did the small animals fall.
2.110.25	Having obtained them, he should place them in himself.
2.110.26	He saw four hymns above the night.
2.110.27	He praised them.
2.110.28	Having obtained them, he placed them in himself. 
2.110.29	Because he placed them in his own self, therefore it is Aptoryāma.
2.110.30	The Aptoiryamas are indeed the Soma, as it were, in its own form, and the Aptoiryamas follow after it.
2.111.1	There are sixty-two Stotriya verses.
2.111.2	Then the sixty-two is Viraj.
2.111.3	Cattle are Viraj.
2.111.4	Then the two (verses) are the sacrificer himself, who is two-footed, and the one beyond him.
2.111.5	For the protection of cattle, for the non-loss of cattle,
2.111.6	He who knows thus, his wealth is not taken away by others.
2.111.7	They say, "This is one hymn, and it is sung in four ways. One should sing it in six ways to the Hotṛ, in six ways to Maitrāvaruṇa, in six ways for the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, and in six ways for Acchāvāka."
2.111.8	The Hotṛ alone should sing it.
2.111.9	And these twenty-four are the Stotriyas.
2.111.10	Twenty-four half-months make a year.
2.111.11	The year is Prajapati.
2.111.12	Prajapati is indeed beyond this, having been raised up.
2.111.13	For the protection of cattle, for the non-loss of cattle.
2.111.14	He whose wealth is not taken away by others, he who knows this.
2.111.15	They say, however, that the Stotras should be of three, fifteen, seventeen and twenty-one verses.
2.111.16	All the sacrificial rites are completed with twenty-one verses,
2.111.17	And this indeed is the firm and established Stoma, namely, twenty-one.
2.111.18	Therefore the Stoma should be of twenty-one verses at the end.
2.112.6	"You invoke that Indra, the giver of wealth, the giver of riches, the giver of the great form."
2.112.7	They go to the great form by that, and also cattle are wealth. For the securing of cattle.
2.112.8	Then indeed, having obtained it, one should go to it, saying, "This is the wealth." "This is Vishnu who has wandered." This is the churning of the Idas. The Idas are the cattle. It is for the purpose of enclosing the cattle.
2.112.9	This indeed is what they offer to them. "Come, O Ida! Come, O Ida!" The Idas are cattle. Therefore, these additional hymns should be performed.
2.112.10	Then Tandy said: Prajapati created the animals.
2.112.11	They, having been created from him, fled.
2.112.12	He said to Agni: "Stop these for me."
2.112.13	He did not stop them with the Jarabodhi.
2.112.14	He said (to Agni): "Stop these for Indra."
2.112.15	He did (not stop them) with the Satrasahya.
2.112.16	He said to the god Ishana, "Stop them."
2.112.17	He did not stop them with the Margiya-Vena.
2.112.18	He said to Vishnu, "Stop them,"
2.112.19	He stopped them with the Vaishnavi-Varavantiya.
2.112.20	What he stopped, that is the Varavantiya-ness of the Varavantiyas.
2.112.21	Therefore, these additional praises should be performed.
2.113.1	Now, this is the Goṣava sacrifice.
2.113.2	One who desires heaven should perform this sacrifice.
2.113.3	It consists of thirty-six verses.
2.113.4	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
2.113.5	The Brihātī is the heaven, the world, and the kingdom.
2.113.6	In the Brihatī indeed, they go to the heavenly world, to the sovereignty, to the firm establishment.
2.113.7	The Brihatī indeed pervades all these worlds with syllables. With ten syllables it pervades this world, with ten the atmosphere, with ten the yonder world, with four the directions, with two the day and night.
2.113.8	The one who pervades these worlds, may he pervade these worlds.
2.113.9	His praise is praised, and the four are united with the four tri-s.
2.113.10	Other praises are united with the three-fold, the three-fold is the heavenly world.
2.113.11	He who goes to heaven by means of this (Sāman) goes quickly, as one goes to the place where he wishes to go by means of a chariot with four horses.
2.113.12	His two Sāmans are Bṛhat and Rathantara, which are heavenly, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
2.113.13	It becomes Ukthya. Ukthas are progeny and cattle.
2.113.14	Progeny and cattle are heaven. It is for the attainment of heaven.
2.113.15-18	The sacrificial fee is twelve thousand. The year has twelve months. The year is heaven. For the attainment of heaven.
2.113.19	Wherever he finds it, he should stand there.
2.113.20	The bull conquers the world.
2.113.21	Janaka of Videha performed a sacrifice with this (rite).
2.113.22	Brahmanas sat around him.
2.113.23	He asked, "What is the Stoma?"
2.113.24	He replied, "Sudakshina Kshaimir said, 'This is not the Trivrit Stoma.'"
2.113.25	What is his vow? What is the fee?
2.113.26	He said to him, "This is what he said:
2.113.27	He said, 'The fee is indeed the hope of the sacrifice. The vow is indeed the hope.
2.113.28	He did not dare to perform the sacrifice.
2.113.29	He performed the sacrifice.
2.113.30	King Shibi of the Puṇyakas performed the sacrifice. He was recognized in the assembly.
2.113.31	He (Yajna) indeed repeated that (mantra). He said, "Indeed this (Yajna), the old one, was (performed).
2.113.32	One should perform this sacrifice with the old one.
2.113.33	For the old one has been permitted everything."
2.113.34	This indeed is the old sacrifice.
2.113.35	One should perform it with the elder one.
2.114.1	This is the varied one.
2.114.2	One should offer this sacrifice for the sake of cattle.
2.114.3	He indeed is sixfold and tenfold.
2.114.4	The sixfold are the animals.
2.114.5	The tenfold is the milking of the animals.
2.114.6	That is their milk.
2.114.7	They indeed are two fives, fivefold and fivefold.
2.114.8	They are indeed the animals.
2.114.9	His morning pressing consists of twenty, the midday pressing of sixteen, and the evening pressing of twenty.
2.114.10	Just as a well-made axle has a larger bearing at both ends for the sake of its well-made condition, so the midday pressing consists of sixteen.
2.114.11	The two-twentieths are distributed on both sides, the front and the rear, in greater quantity.
2.114.12	Therefore, animals are mostly divided into the fore-half and the hind-half.
2.114.13	They carry with the fore-half, and they milk with the hind-half, and also they produce with the hind- half.
2.114.14	He who knows this, obtains both the milk of the cow and the milk of the ass.
2.114.15	In that sacrifice, they should offer both the Brihat and the Rathantara. For there are two kinds of animals, some are Rathantara and others are Brihat.
2.114.16	Those animals which have teeth on one side only are Rathantara, and those which have teeth on both sides are Brihat. It is for the purpose of including both kinds of animals.
2.114.17	It becomes a Ukthya (Sāman). Ukthyas are cattle. For the securing of cattle.
2.114.18	His Acchāvāka-Sāman is Udvasīya. The entire form of Prstha is Prstha. Cattle are Prsthas. For the securing, in succession, of cattle.
2.115.1	Now this is the Sadyaskrī (Sāman)
2.115.2	They were surrounded and did not go away.
2.115.3	They came and offered sacrifices.
2.115.4	They brought this speech, the white cow, the true, called by the name of horses, saying, "She accepts this."
2.115.5	They said, "Which of us is better? Let us raise her up."
2.115.6	She, being angry, said, "She did not accept me," and became the lioness, facing both ways, and ascended upwards.
2.115.7	He stood between the gods and the Asuras, and took that which belonged to the gods and that which belonged to Asuras.
2.115.8	The gods and the Asura approached her.
2.115.9	When she was approaching the gods, she said: "What will be mine if I approach you?"
2.115.10	"You will receive the first oblation of Agni."
2.115.11	They have established her in the sacrifice.
2.115.12	This is the northern altar.
2.115.13	The offering to Agni reaches her first.
2.116.1	They support Agni, they establish the northern altar. This is the northern altar,
2.116.2	The offering to Agn reaches her first.
2.116.3	Then these (gods) brought to him the horse, white like the sun, called 'horse', saying, "He will take this (horse) from you."
2.116.4	They said, "This one is better than us. We shall not go to him.
2.116.5	The gods and the sages having assembled said, "The sacrifices will be discontinued if the fee is not accepted."
2.116.6	This is said in that regard:
2.116.7	O son of Bharata, the Adityas took the horse as fee from the Angirasas.
2.116.8	O son of Bhrgu, they did not return it. O son of Bharata they did not accept it.
2.116.9	The priests, having gone back to her, the priests, having taken her back, (said): "Let there be no absence of leaders, let there be no absence (of us) at the sacrifice, let there be absence of (us) not knowing (the way)."
2.117.1	The Adityas, the Rudras, the Vasus, and the Angiras have come. Accept this gift, O Angiras.
2.117.2	This gift, O great and wide one, may the gods give you a boon.
2.117.3	May that be your good intention.
2.117.4	May it be yours, may it be yours, every day, and may you grasp it.
2.117.5	Thus he makes them grasp it.
2.117.6	Then the Ādityas went to heaven first, the Angirasas followed.
2.117.7	He who has an enemy, who wants to curse, who wants to compete, should offer this sacrifice.
2.117.8	His sin diminishes, his enemy goes to heaven.
2.117.9	The altar is made of barley.
2.117.10	Because it is made first.
2.117.11	The northern altar is made of grains.
2.117.12	The Adityas, the Angiras, performed the sacrifice with grains.
2.117.13	Because they performed the sacrifice with barley, that is the grain-ness of barley.
2.117.14	With barley, indeed, one yokes the sacrifice of the hated foe.
2.117.15	The sacrificial post is made of Khavalva wood with a tip of stone. It is for Indra.
2.117.16	Having conquered, they offer animals together for the sake of unity.
2.117.17	A male bull is bought for Soma. It is for the sake of virility. One says, "We have become virile."
2.117.18	It is a bull with horns. For the sake of being with Indra.
2.117.19-23	The wives of the pot-born ones are the best, they are from the house of the one who was born first. For they are taken from the house of him who was born first.
2.117.24	He places the gold on his mouth while he is meditating.
2.117.25	Gold is truth.
2.117.26	It becomes truth for him when it rises.
2.118.1	A white horse is the fee. The horse is the heavenly one. It is for the attainment of the heavenly world.
2.118.2	The horse-chariot is the Soma-drinking one. The maximum distance is a Yojana.
2.118.3	This is the lowest of all distances, a yojana, or the highest of all distances.
2.118.4	He sits down on the seat of curd and butter.
2.118.5	The ghee that drips from it is poured into the pot of ghee.
2.118.6	It is as if it were a sudden yojana, or a yojana in this way, or a yojann in this way. The priests are placed in this way.
2.118.7	They approach him in the morning and consecrate him.
2.118.8	He offers thrice, closing his eyes thrice, and looking thrice.
2.118.9	These are the consecration and the Upasads.
2.119.1	It is three-fold, with the Rathantara as the Sama. The three-fold is Brahman.
2.119.2	The Rathantara is Brahman. One goes to the heavenly world with Brahman.
2.119.3	Some say: It should be three-fold, and with the Brihat as the Sama.
2.119.4	Brahma is the Trivrt (stoma), the Brihat is the Kshatra.
2.119.5	"He goes to the heavenly world by uniting with Brahma and Kshatra."
2.119.6	They say, "The Rathantara should be Trivrt.
2.119.7	Brahma is the Trivṛt.
2.119.8	Brahma indeed is the Rathantara.
2.119.9	Brahma rules over the heavenly world.
2.119.10	In that (Soma-sacrifice) the Rathantara-Sāman should be Trivṛt.
2.119.11	In that (Soma-sacrifiice) they say, the Sāmans should be performed in such a way. The gods went to heaven by means of such (Sāmans). We shall go to heaven by means means of such (Samams).
2.119.12	Others say, the Sāmāns which are born of Agni should be performed.
2.119.13	The Sadyahkri is like an uncooked (food).
2.119.14	Agni is the one who cooks the uncooked.
2.119.15	They say that the Agniṣṭoma Sāmans should be performed.
2.119.16	These are the Agniyoṇis, the Agniṣṭoṃa Sāmans.
2.119.17	Therefore, the Agniṣtoma Sāmans should indeed be performed.
2.119.18	Then there is this (verse): "We shall quickly go to heaven, quickly to the most quickly."
2.119.19	It has twelve hymns, the year has twelve months; the year is heaven, the world; for the attainment of heaven, the world.
2.119.20	It has twenty-four hymns and praises, the year has twenty-four half-months;
2.119.21	the year is heaven, world; for the attaining of heaven, the worlds.
2.120.1	Now these two are the sequence.
2.120.2	The Adityas and the Angirasas were competing for the heavenly world.
2.120.3	The Adityas went to the heavenly world first.
2.120.4	The Angirasas desired, "We too should go to that world which the Adityas have attained."
2.120.5	They saw this sacrifice.
2.120.6	They brought it to them indirectly, though it was already there.
2.120.7	They performed the sacrifice with it.
2.120.8	They took the white cow as the sacrificial fee and became equal to the Adityas.
2.120.9	These Adityas and Angiras are equal.
2.120.10	He who knows this becomes equal to the Aditvas and Angiras.
2.120.11	Some say, "One should perform this sacrifice if one's brother is superior to him."
2.121.5	Having conquered, they offer the animals together for the sake of unity.
2.121.6	The Soma-purchasing cow is a female for the sake of remoteness.
2.121.7	The Vasativarī waters are from the house of the one who is to be married first,
2.121.8	because they are taken first.
2.121.9	Having eaten clarified butter, he lies down.
2.121.10	The food that he eats is the same as the food that is eaten by the one who is being initiated.
2.121.11	He lies between the thighs of his beloved wife, not touching her.
2.121.12	He lies with a golden object placed on his mouth, as if performing austerities.
2.121.13	Gold is truth.
2.121.14	The truth that he utters becomes true.
2.121.15	Silver is used because it is indirect.
2.121.16	The white cow is the sacrificial fee, for the sake of remoteness.
2.121.17	The chariot with horses is the Soma-bearer, with three parts, for the sake or remoteness.
2.121.18	On it the Adhvaryu sits down with the curd-vessel.
2.121.19	Whatever ghee falls from it, they pour into the vessel of ghee.
2.121.20	For the priests are placed at half a Krośa (about 1/2 mile) from it, as if it were the Sadyas (the first day of the Soma sacrifice).
2.121.21	They come to him in the morning and perform the sacrifice.
2.121.22	He offers thrice, closes his eyes thrice, and looks thrice.
2.121.23	These are the Diksā and Upasads.
2.121.24	This is the Aṣṭādaśapāvamāna (sacrifice).
2.121.25	The Trivṛt is performed in secret.
2.121.26	The Adityas are the Agniṣṭoma sacrifices, the Angiras are the Ukthya sacrifices.
2.121.27	This Ukthya is indeed the Agniṣṭo ma sacrifice, which is being brought back for speed.
2.121.28	Then this is the twenty-four Pavamāna.
2.121.29	The Trivṛt is indeed the indirect one.
2.121.30	Now this Atiratra is indeed a Nidāneṣa, and the Agnistoma is taken back to the sixteenth day for quickness.
2.122.1	Now this is the Parikri.
2.122.2	Khāṇḍika and Hāudbāri and Keśin of Dārvaspṛdā fought with each other among the Pañcālas.
2.122.3	He, Khāṇḍika, wanted to defeat Keśin.
2.122.4	"One should perform the sacrifice on the same day."
2.122.5	Then, having been instructed by him, they perform the sacrifice for their brother.
2.122.6	Those Brahmanas were his: Ahina, Ashvatthi, Keshi, Satyakami, Gangina, Rakshita, Lushakapin, Kharagali.
2.122.7	They approached him.
2.122.8	He sat down meditating.
2.122.9	They said to him, "What is the king meditating on?"
2.122.10	He said, "I do not have anything to be thought of."
2.122.11	"You Brahmanas should recite this. The Adityas and the Angirasas were competing for the heavenly world."
2.122.12	The Adityas went to the heavenly world first, and the Angiras became inferior.
2.122.13	"He who performs this sacrifice to his brother, he becomes the same. His enemy, the brother, becomes inferior."
2.123.1	He (the sacrificer) was approached by Khāṇḍika, who said: "You are going to perform a sacrifice.
2.123.2	He will certainly be the better one. I am thinking that he will be the better one."
2.123.3	They said to him: "This is the sacrificial rite of Parīkīrti.
2.123.4	We shall perform it for you."
2.123.5	"So be it."
2.123.6	They performed it for him.
2.123.7	They praise each of the three verses of this (hymn) with one verse.
2.123.8	Brahma is the first Stotriya, Kshatra is the second, and Vis is the third.
2.123.9	Kshatra and Vis indeed support Brahma.
2.123.10	And the world of enemies follows Kshatra and Vis.
2.123.11	He who cut off the two (worlds), he cut off the world of enemies.
2.123.12	The Self is the first Stotriya, the wife is the second, and the progeny is the third.
2.123.13	Indeed, the wife and progeny are the support of the Self.
2.123.14	The world of one's enemies follows the wife and progeny.
2.123.15	He who cut off the two, indeed cut off the world of his enemies.
2.124.1	Then he expelled the Khāṇḍika.
2.124.2	Then the Kesi (sutra) of Darbha became the Parā (sutra) and the Khāṇḍika (sutra).
2.124.3	He who knows this becomes his own self and his enemy becomes his brother.
2.124.4	For him there are three Bahispavamāna verses, four Ajya verses, five Madhyandina Pavamāna verses, four Prstha verses, seven Arbhava Pavamāna verses and one Agnistoma Sama verse.
2.124.5	And these twenty-four are the Stotriyas.
2.124.6	The year consists of twenty-four half-months.
2.124.7	From the year itself, Khāṇḍikya, Audbhari, Keśin, Dārbhya, and Nunudu, from the year itself, went away to the other side.
2.124.8	From the very year he drives away his hateful enemy, from the year he goes to the other side, he who knows thus.
2.125.1	Now this is the one-triad.
2.125.2	One who desires offspring should offer this sacrifice.
2.125.3	Prajapati desired, "May I beget many offspring and cattle and may I attain this prosperity."
2.125.4	He saw this sacrifice.
2.125.5	He brought it.
2.125.6	He offered it.
2.125.7	He thought, "By whom should I praise?"
2.125.8	He saw himself.
2.125.9	He praised with that. He thought, "By what should I praise?"
2.125.10	He saw the Prāṇāpānavyānas.
2.125.11	By them he praised.
2.125.12	He, by himself, by the Prāṇapānavyānas, he, by himself, the Prāṇanapānavyānas established the sacrifice in this very way.
2.125.13	Then indeed he is born with many offspring and cattle, he eats this portion, which is this.
2.125.14	He who knows this, becomes possessed of many offspring and cattle.
2.126.1	By means of this, indeed, Śāṇḍilīya Udaras performed the Iṣṭi.
2.126.2	He thought to himself, "One should perform the sacrifice with the Ekārikā."
2.126.3	But he did not tell it to anyone.
2.126.4	Then his wife, Gandharvi,
2.126.5	was taken away by a Gandharva.
2.126.6	He said to her, "The sacrifice is indeed a terrible thing."
2.126.7	"Your husband will perform that sacrifice."
2.126.8	She asked her husband, "The sacrifice indeed is a terrible thing." "
2.126.9	"Is it true that you will perform that sacrifice?"
2.126.10	He said, "What I did not tell anyone, that was in my mind only. Who told this to him?"
2.126.11	"He who is a Gandharva, he will tell you."
2.126.12	He said, "Ask him."
2.126.13	"You should sacrifice to him, or you should not sacrifice to him."
2.126.14	He asked him, "Should I sacrifice to him, should I not sacrifice to him?"
2.126.15	He said, "We know him as he knows him."
2.126.16	"He who knows this hymn should offer sacrifice with it." As Prajapati was pleased with it,
2.126.17	he did not dare to offer sacrifice with it.
2.127.1	Śaśvadhodas Śāṇḍilī went to heaven by means of this very sacrifice, because he thought, "I shall sacrifice with only one Ekākinī."
2.127.2	This is indeed a sacrifice which is like another. One who performs this sacrifice becomes free from sin or free from great sin.
2.127.3	In this sacrifice, the Bahispavamāna is performed on one day. The verse is recited, "Obeisance to him, the singer, the man."
2.127.4	The Madhyandina Pavamana in the three (verses) is in the Gāyatrī metre. The Utsheda is in the Brhatī metre. That itself is the Nidhana. The Aushana is in the Tristubh metre.
2.127.5	The Arbhava Pavamana in this (verse) is in the Gayatri metre.
2.127.6	The Atichandas is in the Gayatripasya.
2.127.7	That itself is the Svaras. That itself is Nidhana.
2.127.8	It becomes seven-footed.
2.127.9	The seven are the metres.
2.127.10	The Atichandas metre surpasses all the metres.
2.127.11	Therefore, all the metres are included in it.
2.127.12	They say that the Vamadevya hymn should be performed with five endings.
2.127.13	The Pavamana hymn of the Arbhava (Samhita) has five metres and the Sama has seven metres.
2.127.14	By the five endings, one attains the metres.
2.127.15	It is said, "Whatever is common to the seven steps, that is the prosperity here."
2.127.16	They say, "The Gayatra-side should be done."
2.127.17	That is the tone, that is the end.
2.127.18	The tone is the Self, the end is the offspring.
2.127.19	This is more prosperous than that, namely, the Gayatra-side.
2.127.20	Therefore, the Gayatra side should be done."
2.127.21	Those twenty-four are the Stotriyas.
2.127.22	Twenty-four half-months are a year.
2.127.23	The year is procreation.
2.127.24	He who is procreation, may he procreate me."
2.128.1	Now this is the Brihaspati-sava.
2.128.2	Prajapati, creating the creatures, slipped.
2.128.3	He lay down as food.
2.128.4	All the gods were jealous of him, saying, "Mine, mine!"
2.128.5	They said, "Let us worship this one."
2.128.6	They did not succeed in dividing it.
2.128.7	They said, let us play a game with it."
2.128.8	They played a game with it.
2.128.9	Brihaspati saw the path of the game.
2.128.10	He went first and, having gone around by the chariot, stood still.
2.128.11	Those gods did not find that by which they could have gone beyond.
2.128.12	The race was as long as the chariot-ride.
2.128.13	Then he won that race.
2.128.14	Because Brihaspati won, it is the Brihaspati-sacrifice.
2.128.15	Indra said to him who was winning the race, "I place you in front.
2.128.16	Sacrifice to me with this sacrifice."
2.128.17	So be it.
2.128.18	He placed him in front.
2.128.19	He sacrificed to him.
2.128.20	Then Indra attained the foremost position among all the gods.
2.128.21	He who knows this attains the foremost position among his own people.
2.128.22	This indeed is the sacrifice of two, of the Brahman and the Kshatriya.
2.128.23	When Brihaspati conquered, he conquered for the Brahman.
2.128.24	Whatever Indra offered, that made him a king.
2.128.25	He was the priest of Indra alone, not of the other gods.
2.128.26	He desired, 'May I become the priest of all the gods.'
2.128.27	He offered this very sacrifice.
2.128.28	Then he became the priest of all gods.
2.128.29	Brihaspati is the priest of the gods.
2.129.1	It has the Rathantara as its third layer.
2.129.2	Brahma is threefold, and the Rathantara is Brahma.
2.129.3	He indeed attained the radiance of Brahma by means of Brahma.
2.129.4	He who knows this attains the radiance of Brahma through Brahma.
2.129.5	His fee is thirty-three.
2.129.6	There are thirty-three deities.
2.129.7	He obtains the Purodhas of the gods.
2.129.8	The horse is the thirty-fourth.
2.129.9	The horse indeed is the form of Prajapati.
2.129.10	By that he obtains the Purodhasa of the gods with Prajapati.
2.129.11	At the morning pressing he gives eight, at the midday pressing eleven, at the third pressing twelve, one at the Anubandhya, one at the Upavasatha.
2.129.12	At the morning pressing he should give a horse as the Anusavana.
2.129.13	Now those eight which he gives at the morning pressing, the Vasus are eight; he thereby obtains the office of the Vasus.
2.129.14	Then those eleven which he gives at midday pressing, the Rudras are eleven; he thereby obtains office of the Rudras.
2.129.15	Then those twelve which he gives at third pressing, the Adityas are twelve; he thereby obtains of the Adityas.
2.129.16	Now, the one (cow) which is given to Mitra-Varuna, that one he obtains by it as the Purodha.
2.129.17	And the one (cow), which is given at the Upavasatha, that one he makes the Dakshina-worthy rite.
2.129.18	And the horse which is given at Anusavana, that one he takes as the Purodha of Prajapati.
2.130.1	They say, one should give at the morning pressing with the mind, at the third pressing with the mind. One should give at the midday pressing.
2.130.2	They say, the morning pressing is not the proper place for giving gifts, nor is the third pressing.
2.130.3	One should give at the noon pressing.
2.130.4	That is the proper place, that is the abode.
2.130.5	The two Stomas are not to be given away mentally.
2.130.6	One gives a horse to Brahma.
2.130.7	For Brahma alone is the Dakshina.
2.130.8	When the Madhyandina cups are to be placed, one should say, "One should spread the black antelope skin with the tail towards the Ahavaniya and the neck towards the east" or with the neck towards the north.
2.130.9	The sacrificer sits down and wipes the cups that have been offered, saying, "In the impulse of the divine Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, with Sarasvati, the controller, with the controlling device, with thee, with the royal power of Brihaspati, I anoint thee with Brahman."
2.130.10	He wipes the mouth.
2.130.11	He becomes radiant and lustrous, consecrated with Soma.
2.130.12	They cry out three times. These are the three worlds. In these worlds, his fame is established.
2.131.1	There are eight hundred hymns.
2.131.2	Then, what is a hundred is Viraj.
2.131.3	Viraj is the kingdom.
2.131.4	Then, which is eight is Gayatri.
2.131.5	Gayatri is radiance and luster.
2.131.6	That very lustre he places in front of the Kshatriya.
2.131.7	Therefore the Brahman is the Purohita of the Kshatriyas.
2.131.8	He who desires to be a Purohita should offer this sacrifice. He attains the Purohita-ship.
2.131.9	Some perform it as of one metre, making it all Gayatri. Brihaspati is indeed Gayatri.
2.131.10	Brahman is indeed Gayatri.
2.131.11	May we prosper in the Brahman-splendour of Brahman and Brihaspati.
2.131.12	Those who do so, they attain Agni as the deity, the Gāyatrī metre, and this world.
2.131.13	The other deities, the other metres, the other gods, the other worlds, and the other desires are hidden from them.
2.131.14	Therefore, one should perform as per one's own desire for the attainment of all deities, all meters, all gods, all worlds, and all desires.
2.131.15	In the Pavamāna Sāman of the Adiṣṭa class, there is the Brihat Bṛhaspati Sāman.
2.131.16	Because this is the Savana of Brihaspati.
2.131.17	They enhance the Stoma in that form.
2.132.1	Now this is the Kulaya of Indra and Agni.
2.132.2	Indra and Agni desired, "May we attain the foremost position among the gods who are equal, and may we attain the same prosperity through the same sacrifice."
2.132.3	They saw this sacrifice.
2.132.4	They brought it.
2.132.5	They performed it.
2.132.6	Then they, being equal in excellence to the gods, attained the same prosperity by the same sacrifice.
2.132.7	That is Brahman, indeed, Agni.
2.132.8	The Kshatra is Indra.
2.132.9	He is indeed Trivrit and Panchasad.
2.132.10	Brahman is indeed Trivrita.
2.132.11	Kshatra is Panchasad.
2.132.12	Agni attained supremacy by the Trivṛt (Stoma), Indra by the Pañcadaśa (Stoma).
2.132.13	Its two Sāmans are Bṛhat and Rathantara.
2.132.14	Rathantara is Brahman, Bṛhat is Ksatra.
2.132.15	By the Rathantara, Agni attained supremacy, by the Bṛhat, Indra.
2.132.16	Those two, the Brahman and the Kshatriya, who desire to attain the best position among their own equals, and to attain equal prosperity through the same sacrifice, they should offer this sacrifice.
2.132.17	They attain the best position of their own equals and attain equal prosperity through this sacrifice.
2.132.18	The Brāhmaṇa alone attains preeminence by the Trivṛt (Stoma), the Rājanya by the Pañcadaśa.
2.132.19	The Brāhmaṇa attains preeminence alone by the Rathantara (Stoma), and the Rājanya alone by the Bṛhat. Because these Stotras, Trivṛt and Pañcadaśas, are alternated,
2.133.1	therefore the Kulaya belongs to Indra and Agni.
2.133.2	They say that the Trivṛt and Pañcadaśa are connected in the Sattra.
2.133.3	The Trivṛt, Pañcadaśas are indeed connected in the Stotras.
2.133.4	There should be six Trivṛt Stotras and six Pañcadaśī Stotras.
2.133.5	Those which are in the morning and those which are in the midday should be three-fold. Those which are in evening should be fifteen-fold.
2.133.6	The midday should be fifteen-folds, the Hotr's Prstha should be three-folds.
2.133.7	In the fifteen-fold midday they arrange the Rathantara.
2.133.8-11	The Rathantara is Brahman, the Pañcadaśa is Kshatra. They thus establish Brahman in Kshatra. And when the Hotr's Prstha is Trivrt, Brahman is Trivrt and Bṛhat is Kshatra, they thus establish Kshatra in Brahman. And when they thus established themselves in each other, they attained supremacy.
2.133.12	Now, indeed, these two are invincible.
2.133.13	He who knows this conquers invincible fame, invincible prosperity, and the invincible heavenly world.
2.133.14	Now, indeed, these (verses) are connected in the Trivrt and Pañcadaśa Stotras. From the connected pair of verses are born offspring and cattle. It is for propagation.
2.133.15	Now the Stotras are indeed the vital airs, and these vital airs are connected.
2.133.16	Therefore these Stotras should be connected in the order of three, five, fifteen.
2.133.17	The Madhyandina Pavamana has the Indra-Agni Sama, the Sama prescribed for the Istisama.
2.133.18	For this is the sacrifice to Indra and Agni.
2.133.19	They thus increase the Stoma by its form.
2.134.1	Now this is the Agniṣṭoma.
2.134.2	The gods saw Indra as having three heads, and killed him. He gave the Yatis to the Śālavṛkas. He killed the Arura-faced ones. He killed Brihaspati. He killed the Asura Namuci. He cut off the head of the Asura Namuchi. These are the divine sins.
2.134.3	He wandered about in the forest, not approaching the gods.
2.134.4	He said to the gods, "Sacrifice for me."
2.134.5	They said, "No."
2.134.6	"These are the sins you have committed against the gods. We will not sacrifice for you."
2.134.7	Then Agni became his friend among the gods.
2.134.8	Then he said to Agni, "You sacrifice for me."
2.134.9	He said, "So be it."
2.134.10	"I want to know that deity with whom you will sacrifice."
2.134.11	He did not know that deity with which he would sacrifice.
2.134.12	He said, "I do not know that deity."
2.134.13	"You yourself should sacrifice."
2.134.14	"So be it."
2.134.15	That Agni himself created this Agniṣṭoma for himself.
2.134.16	He performed a sacrifice with it.
2.134.17	It immediately burnt all his sins.
2.134.18	Just as a snake would be freed from its skin, or as a reed is freed from its sheath, so was he freed from all sins.
2.134.19	He is the one who has removed sin, he shines. He indeed is Indra.
2.134.20	He who is mentioned or who is slandered, he should offer this sacrifice.
2.134.21	Immediately all his sin is burnt.
2.134.22	Just as a snake is freed from its skin, just as a reed is freed from its sheath, so is he freed from all sin.
2.135.1	If one thinks that he has committed a sin with his mouth, he should offer an Agniṣṭoma sacrifice with three Stotras.
2.135.2	He who speaks falsehood commits a sin with his face.
2.135.3	The three-fold Stoma is the face of Stotras.
2.135.4	By this he removes sin from the face.
2.135.5	If one thinks that he committed a sin with the arms, he should offer Agniṣṭoma with fifteen Stotras.
2.135.6	He indeed commits a sin with his arms, who kills one who is not to be killed.
2.135.7	The arms are the fifteen Stoma-s.
2.135.8	He indeed commits a sin by his arms, who does not give to one who is not a recipient.
2.135.9	If one thinks that he has committed a sin by his belly, he should offer a sacrifice with the seventeen Stoma-s to Agni.
2.135.10	He indeed commit a sin by his stomach, who eats food without digesting it.
2.135.11	The seventeen-fold stoma is the belly.
2.135.12	By means of it one removes sin from the belly.
2.135.13	If one thinks that one has committed a sin with the feet, one should offer an Agniṣṭoma with twenty-one stomas.
2.135.14	He who goes to the people commits a sin with his feet.
2.135.15	The twenty-one-fold stoma indeed is the establishment.
2.135.16	By means it one removes sin with the feet.
2.135.17	Some say, one should perform the Jyotiṣṭoma and Agniṣṭoma sacrifices.
2.135.18	If the Bahispavamāna stotra has three verses, then one removes sin from the mouth.
2.135.19	If the Ajya stotras have fifteen verses, then one eliminates sin from the arms.
2.135.20	Now, when there are seventeen Prstha-s, then by that he removes sin from the seventeen abdominal parts.
2.135.21	And when there is the Agniṣṭoma-sāman consisting of twenty-one (sāman-s), then by that he destroys sin by means of the feet.
2.136.1-2	One desiring brilliance, one desiring Brahmic glory, one desiring cattle, one desiring offspring, one desiring prosperity, one desiring strength, one desiring glory should offer the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice with three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, fifteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one, twenty-three, twenty-five, twenty-seven, twenty-nine, thirty-one, thirty-three, thirty-five, thirty-seven, thirty-nine, forty-one, forty-three, forty-five, forty-seven, forty-nine, fifty-one, fifty-three, fifty-five, fifty-seven, fifty-nine, sixty-one, sixty-three, sixty-five, sixty-seven, sixty-nine, seventy-one, seventy-three, seventy-five, seventy-seven, seventy-nine, eighty-one, eighty-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-nine, ninety-one, ninety-three, ninety-five, ninety-seven, ninety-nine, one hundred, one hundred and three, one hundred and five, one hundred and seven, one hundred and nine, one hundred and eleven, one hundred and thirteen, one hundred and fifteen, one hundred and seventeen, one hundred and nineteen, one hundred and twenty-one, one hundred and twent-three, one hundred and t
2.136.3	One should offer with that alone.
2.136.4	This is the Trivṛt, this is the Pañcadaśa, this is the Saptadaśa, this the Ekavimśa.
2.136.5	Indeed, Agni is dependent on these breaths.
2.136.6	One who is eloquent but does not shine should offer with this.
2.136.7	Just as a necklace seized by a snake, so is one who is eloquent but shines.
2.136.8	They indeed cast him into the fire, who, having been appointed as the Agniṣṭoma-priest, performs the sacrifice.
2.136.9	Just as one would cast a gold coin seized by a black spot into the fire, and by the mass of iron would remove all the black spot, so they indeed remove all his sin.
2.136.10	He becomes free from sin, luminous, and endowed with brahmic glory.
2.136.11	They also say, "One who has cattle should offer this sacrifice if his cattle do not enjoy themselves."
2.136.12	For just as the old and worn out do not enjoy themselves, so do cattle.
2.136.13	His Agniṣṭoma-sāman is in the Rāvaṇī verses.
2.136.14	The Rāvaṇīs are indeed the waters.
2.136.15	They indeed send him to Agni, whom they consecrate for the Agniṣṭoma.
2.137.1	Just as one would light a fire from a worn-out fire-pan and sprinkle it with water, and good plants would grow in it, and animals would delight in them, so all animals delight in him.
2.137.2	"His life-breaths are purified by Agni." This is the first verse of the Agni Pavamana hymn.
2.137.3	They say, "Those who begin with the Pavamana hymns succeed with these life-breaths."
2.137.4	The reason why this is the first verse is that Vayu is the life-breath, and they succeed with the life-breaths.
2.137.5	"O Agni, O shining one who purifies!" Food is what purifies. By food they thus nourish him.
2.137.6	"O Agni, O wind, O shining one!" Wind is the breath. By the breath they thus nourish him in the forward direction.
2.137.7	"O most pure Agni!" He who is accused becomes impure.
2.137.8	They make him pure, clean and fit for sacrifice.
2.137.9	The verses of the Madhyamdina Pavamana are the Brihatis.
2.137.10	They indeed send Agni to him whom they consecrate as Agni-priest.
2.137.11	"He gives his body to Agni Vaiśvānara, saying, "He indeed is the protector of bodies."
2.137.12	"Protect us, O Agni, with thy one-ness!" In these (verses) the Rathantara is the Prastara (Sastra) of the Narmadhas.
2.137.13	By these (verses) Narmadha, son of Ushas, removed the limbs of Agni.
2.137.14	By these very (verses) he removes the limbs of Agni.
2.137.15	The Agniṣṭoma Sāman is in the Apānaptrya stotras, with the verse, "May the divine goddesses grant us peace."
2.137.16	The Apānaptryas are indeed the waters.
2.137.17	Those whom they consecrate as Agniṣṭomas, the fires indeed throw them out.
2.138.1	Just as one would sprinkle with water that which has been burnt by fire, so is it for peace.
2.138.2	They say, "He who sprinkles with water what has been burnt by fire, does more harm. It may become a disease."
2.138.3	"Come to our sacrifice touching the sky, O Vayu, with good thoughts." This is to be done in those (verses) containing the word 'Vayu'. Vayu is peace. It is for peace that he does it.
2.138.4	They say, "He who lights the fires and then fans them with a fan, they shine forth more."
2.138.5	"Indeed, this is the shining forth."
2.138.6	They say, "The sacrificer indeed wishes that he should shine forth."
2.138.7	If it is for shining forth, then indeed Vayu is for shining forth.
2.138.8	If it is to be peaceful, then indeed Vāyu is to be peaceful.
2.138.9	Therefore, the rites are to be performed in these very Vayu-related (rites).
2.138.10	The sacrificial fee is a goat and gold.
2.138.11	The goat is related to Agni, and gold is related to Agni.
2.138.12	Some say that the sacrificial fee is a bull.
2.138.13	The bull carries, Agni carries the oblation to the gods.
2.138.14	They indeed enhance the Stoma with its form.
2.139.1	Now this is the Indra-stotra.
2.139.2	Indra indeed desired, "May I attain the foremost position among all the gods."
2.139.3	He saw this sacrifice.
2.139.4	He brought it.
2.139.5	He performed it.
2.139.6	Then he attained the foremost position among the gods.
2.139.7	He who knows this attains the foremost position among his own people.
2.139.8	Indeed, the sacrifice was in Indra first.
2.139.9	The prosperity of the gods is indeed in him.
2.139.10	The sacrifice is indeed the prosperity of the gods.
2.139.11	He indeed grew up against Vritra.
2.139.12	He approached the gods, saying, "With your strength, I shall slay this Vritra."
2.139.13	They said to him, "That indeed is ours, the sacrifice that is yours alone. Give that to us."
2.139.14	Therefore, when the king is desirous of conquest, they desire to give him poison.
2.139.15	Therefore, when the king desires conquest, he gives the gift to the people.
2.139.16	He gave the morning pressing to the Vasus, the midday pressing to the Rudras, the third pressing to the Adityas, and the entire pressing to the Visve Devas.
2.139.17	With that power Indra killed Vritra.
2.139.18	The gods conquered the Asuras.
2.139.19	Having slain Vritra and having conquered, he saw these shining glories of them separately.
2.139.20	He was cursed.
2.139.21	He thought, "How can I unite these glories of them?"
2.139.22	He performed this very sacrifice.
2.139.23	By that he united all the glories of them.
2.139.24	He who knows this, wins the prosperity of his enemies.
2.140.1	All of it is indeed Indra-related.
2.140.2	The morning pressing is Indra-related, the midday pressing is Indra- related, the third pressing is Indra-rel ated.
2.140.3	When the morning pressing, which is in the Gayatri metre, is performed in the Indra-related (pressing), then by that he wins the sacrifice of the Vasus.
2.140.4	Now when the Tristubh (verse) is used in the Madhyandina pressing, it is done in the Indra-verses. By that he wins the sacrifice of the Rudras.
2.140.5	And when the Jagati (verse) is employed in the third pressing, it is used in the Indra-verse. By that he gains the sacrifice of the Adityas and of all the gods.
2.140.6	They approached him, saying, "We have taken the sacrifice; do thou join us in the sacrifice." Just as wives approach their husband, so did they.
2.140.7	He shared the Vasus at the morning pressing, the Rudras at the midday pressing, the Adityas at the third pressing, and all the gods.
2.140.8	Just as a king, having conquered, enjoys his wives, so he enjoyed them.
2.140.9	Therefore they say, "To Indra, to Vasumat, to Rudravat, to Adityavat, to Visvedevyavat."
2.140.10	It becomes fifteenfold.
2.140.11	The fifteenfold is the thunderbolt.
2.140.12	Indra is the thunderbolt.
2.141.2	Prajapati created the gods, the Vasus, the Rudras, and the Adityas.
2.141.3	He gave them the sacrifice and these worlds.
2.141.4	He gave the morning pressing to the Vasus, midday pressing to the Rudras, the third pressing to the Adityas,
2.141.5	He gave this world to the Vasus alone, the atmosphere to the Rudras and the heaven to the Adityast.
2.141.6	Then he created Indra.
2.141.7	He saw that everything among them was divided.
2.141.8	He said, "What is this, that everything among them is divided? Who created me?"
2.141.9	They said, "We created you for supremacy and lordship."
2.141.10	He said, "How can I be supreme and lord over them?"
2.141.11	"Go and tell them, 'Prajapati has not created you as the best or the lord.'
2.141.12	" He went and said, "Prajapati has created you as the worst."
2.141.13	They said, "We are indeed the best, we are the lords, because we are the eldest." They did not know.
2.141.14	He came back and said, "They do not know what you have said."
2.141.15	He saw this sacrifice.
2.141.16	He brought it.
2.141.17	He performed the sacrifice with it.
2.141.18	Having performed it, he destroyed all the enemies.
2.141.19	What was destroyed, that is the nature of the destroyer.
2.141.20	One who knows this destroys his hateful enemy.
2.142.1	All the gods, the Vasus in front, the Rudras on the right, the Adityas behind, the Maruts on the left, the All-gods above, the Sadhyas and Aptyas below, the Angiras on the sides, surrounded him from all sides.
2.142.2	This is indeed the divine glory, the divine assembly, the divine company.
2.142.3	He who knows this goes to the divine glory, the divine assembly, the divine assembly of gods.
2.142.4	He indeed attains six Brihatī verses.
2.142.5	There are six seasons, the glory of the year.
2.142.6	He is indeed led to glory.
2.142.7	He shines in the seasons and in the year, in this glory.
2.142.8-12	The first of these is the Prāṇa, the second is the Apāna, the third is the Vyāna, the fourth is the Udāna, the fifth is the Samāna, the sixth is the Ghrāṇa, the seventh is the Jihvā, the eighth is the Tvaca, the ninth is the Cakṣus, the tenth is the Śrotra, the eleventh is the Manas, the twelfth is the Ātman, the thirteenth is the Prāṇānilayānilayā, the fourteenth is the Prāpāṇānilaya, the fifteenth is the Vyānānilaya, and the sixteenth is the Udānānilaya. The Prāṇa is the Gāyatrī, the Apāna is the Triṣṭubh, the Vyāna is the Jagatī, the Udāna is the Anushtubh, the Samāna is the Paṅkti, the Ghrāṇānilaye is the Paṅktyānilaye, the Jihvā is the Paṅktī, the Tvaca is the Paṅkta, the Cakṣus is the Paṅkte, the Śrotra is the Paṅgā, the Manas is the Paṅga, the Ātman is the Paṅgi, the Prāṇānīlayānilayānīlaye is the Pañca, the Prāpānīlayā is the Pañcānilaye, and the Vyānālayā is the Pancānilaye. The Prātna is the Gāy
2.143.1	When they are separated, they praise. From the separated pair, offspring and cattle are born. It is for propagation.
2.143.2	And man is separated from sins.
2.143.3	By means of the separated (verses), he removes the separated sins.
2.143.4	In them, the Gayatri verse is as explained in the Brahmanas.
2.143.5	Now the Amahayiya verse is as explained.
2.143.6	Then the Brāhmaṇa called Saupāṇna.
2.143.7	Then the one called Satrāsāhi, having conquered, for victory.
2.143.8	"He who is to be conquered by him in battle, he conquers."
2.143.9	Then the one who is to be condemned and the one who is not to be condemned, for the condemnation and non-condemnation of the wicked.
2.143.10	Then the Vishoshavisha and the Sadovisha.
2.143.11	Indra ascended the gods by means of the Vishovishiyas.
2.143.12	They made the Visha by means of the Sadovishis.
2.143.13	Then there are these Tristubhs.
2.143.14	In them there is the Brahma-sāman.
2.143.15	Brahma is the Brahma-sama.
2.143.16	The Kshatra is the Tristubh.
2.143.17	This is the desire of the sacrificer, namely the Brahma-saman.
2.143.18	They themselves, in their own abode, satisfy the sacrificer with desires.
2.144.1	They are the Brahmanas of the feet.
2.144.2	This is the highest in all worlds. Prajapati is that.
2.144.3	For Prajapati is the highest in the worlds.
2.144.4	From where was born the fierce one, the strong one, Indra is that.
2.144.5	The moment he is born, he destroys his enemies. For the moment he is born he has destroyed all his enemies.
2.144.6	The Uma goddesses rejoice in him. The Uma goddesses are the seasons; they rejoice in him.
2.144.7	He has grown by his strength, the mighty one, making the enemy more subservient to the slave. Indra is that.
2.144.8	And the Vyana and the Avana, the Snis, they press for thee, for thy joy. Whatever is Vyana and whatever is not Vyana, all that is the place of this glory.
2.144.9	The All-gods make thee the sacrifice. When they are twice and thrice, they are the Uma. The Uma are the seasons, and they are twice and three.
2.144.10	"Svadā, Svadīya, Svadu, Sṛja, Sam, Prājā, Svadu" - Prājā is indeed Svadu. That which is Svadu is Svadu.
2.144.11	"Adu, Su, Madhu, Madhu, Abhi, Yo, Dhīr" - Prājās is indeed Madhu. That which is Madhu is Madhu.
2.144.12	One who knows this sees progeny for progeny.
2.144.13	The Śyaitas are mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa.
2.145.1	Now these are the names of cows. Animals are the names of cattle, for the purpose of securing animals.
2.145.2	The first has one foot, the next two have three feet each.
2.145.3	They make up seven feet.
2.145.4	The Sakvaris have seven feet.
2.145.5	Animals are Sakvaris.
2.145.6	For the purpose of securing cattle in the proper order.
2.145.7	They say, the Apāvamānya verses should not be used in the Pavamāna Stotra.
2.145.8	They say, the Pavamāna verses are indeed the verses of the moon.
2.145.9	This is indeed the Pavamāna, this is the king Soma.
2.145.10	Therefore they should be used.
2.145.11	O Soma, come to us, O good one, O giver of wealth, O lover, O beautiful, O bull.
2.145.12	These two auspicious and most excellent ones approach them.
2.145.13	The Niva-heads are firmly placed in the middle of the waters.
2.145.14	Shining with ten horns in the directions.
2.145.15	These indeed are the rays of the sun, and these are its horns.
2.145.16	This indeed is the middle of the water.
2.145.17	Among them is the Vārāvatī.
2.145.18	Whatever we have forgotten in this rite, may that be protected by the Vāravantīya (Sāman). May it stand at the end.
2.145.19	They say that whatever speech does not exceed, that should be the Agniṣṭoma Sāman of this day.
2.145.20	The Yajñāyajñiya (Sāman) is what speech does not exceed.
2.145.21	Speech is the Yajñāyājñiya.
2.145.22	Where can speech go beyond speech?
2.145.23	Therefore, the Agniṣṭoma Sāman should be performed on this day.
2.146.1	Now this is the Viśvadev.
2.146.2	One who desires offspring should offer this sacrifice.
2.146.3	Prajapati desired, "May I beget many offspring and cattle, and may I create offspring belonging to all gods."
2.146.4	He saw this sacrifice.
2.146.5	He brought it.
2.146.6	He performed a sacrifice with it.
2.146.7	Then he became very prosperous with progeny and cattle, and created the offspring of all the gods.
2.146.8	If one desires, "May I become very prosperous with progeny, cattle, and may I create the offspring of all gods," one should perform this sacrifice.
2.146.9	One becomes very prosperous with progeny & cattle, and creates the offspring of all deities.
2.146.10	Now, that it is the Vaishvadeva (rite) is for the creation of all the Vaishvadevi (gods).
2.146.11	It is in all the Vaishvadevis. It is for the creation for the sake of the Vaishvadevī (gods).
2.146.12	That (rite) is three-fold. The three-fold is deficient.
2.146.13	The deficient is the procreation. It is for procreation. May it procreate me.
2.146.14	His Rathantara is the Prastaara. The Rathantara is generation. He thinks, "May it generate me."
2.146.15	It becomes a Uktha. Animals are the Ukthas.
2.146.16	Animals are offspring. He thinks, “May it generate me.”
2.147.1	Some say, “It should be seventeen.” Prajapati is seventeen.
2.147.2-8	Prajapati is the begetter. He who is the begetter, may he beget me." Some say, "It should be thirty-nine." There are three of them, the Trivrit. The Trivrit is the lesser. The begetting is the lesser. Therefore, "May he beget me what is the begetting." Some say it should be thirty-three.
2.147.9	Prajapati is the thirty-three.
2.147.10	Prajapati is procreation.
2.147.11	He who is procreation, may he procreate me."
2.147.12	They say, "It should be seventeen.
2.147.13	This indeed is Prajapati, namely seventeen.
2.147.14	Therefore it should be seventeen."
2.147.15	He indeed, having attained the Trivṛt Stoma and the Gāyatrī metre,
2.147.16	This indeed is the divine pair, the begetting, that is the Trivṛṣṭ Stoma and the Gayatri metre.
2.147.17	May that which is the divine pair beget me.
2.147.18	It is a praiseworthy (sacrifice). The praises are the Vidyas. For the propagation of the offspring of the Visvedevas.
2.147.19	This indeed is the name of the sacrifice.
2.147.20	Having performed this sacrifice, Prajapati became.
2.147.21	What he became, therefore it is Bhu.
2.147.22	He who knows this becomes.
2.147.23	This sacrifice is like that of a Vaishya, the Agniṣṭoma is like that of the Brāhmaṇa, and the Indrastoma is like that of Kṣatriya.
2.147.24	When they perform sacrifices with these well-defined rites, then men are known to be speaking.
2.147.25	The Brāhmaṇa speaks, the Kṣatriya speaks, the Vaishya speaks.
2.147.26	Now, as they perform the sacrifice in accordance with the statement, they are not known to be unstated.
2.148.1	Now, this is the offering to be made.
2.148.2	Prajapati created beings.
2.148.3	When they were created, the beings did not know, "Prajapati has created us."
2.148.4	He thought, "How can I create these beings so that they will not know me when created?"
2.148.5	He saw this sacrifice.
2.148.6	He brought it.
2.148.7	He performed it.
2.148.8	Then he called them with it.
2.148.9	What he called is the reason for the name Upahvya.
2.148.10	It is seventeen in the Anirukta (sutra).
2.148.11-13	Just as the Vana-aksha (sutra) is so is the Saptadaśa (sutra) in the Anirukta (sutra). Just as one emerges after having gone through the Vana-aksas, so did he emerge after having seen these (sutra). The Agniṣṭoma Sāman is in these seen (sutra).
2.148.14	Then they knew him, "We are his, he is ours."
2.148.15	And he saw that food was given to them.
2.148.16	They approached him, the people who were the givers of food.
2.148.17	If the people depart from a king or from a Brāhman, one should perform this sacrifice.
2.148.18	In that (sacrifice) he should invite the priests.
2.148.19	These indeed are the classes of the sacrificer, namely the priests.
2.149.1	His Rathantara is the Prstha (Stoma).
2.149.2	Rathantara is food.
2.149.3	Therefore one should give much cooked food in it.
2.149.4	His offspring approach him as givers of food.
2.149.5	Prajapati created the sacrifice.
2.149.6	He gave it to the gods.
2.149.7	Having given the sacrifice, he thought, "I have won."
2.149.8	He thought, "How can I again invite this sacrifice?"
2.149.9	He performed this very sacrifice.
2.149.10	By that he again invited him.
2.149.11	That is why the Upahvya is called Upahvya.
2.149.12	If the sacrifice does not approach him who has performed the sacrifice only once, he should offer this.
2.149.13	The sacrifice indeed departs from him.
2.149.14	If the sacrifice does not come to him who has performed it only once, then it is only by this that he again invites it.
2.149.15	The sacrifice approaches him who knows thus.
2.150.1	Indeed, in the beginning there were two classes of Prajapati's sons, the gods and the asuras.
2.150.2	Then the gods were more powerful than the Asuras.
2.150.3	Prajapati desired, "May the gods be and the Asuras be defeated."
2.150.4	He saw this sacrifice.
2.150.5	He brought it.
2.150.6	He performed it.
2.150.7	He invited the gods to it.
2.150.8	Then he took the Asuras in between by the long-stemmed house.
2.150.9	Then indeed the gods became victorious over the Asuras.
2.150.10	He who knows this becomes victorious over his own self, and his enemy becomes his foe.
2.150.11	He who has an enemy, who would perform sorcery, who would compete, should offer this sacrifice.
2.150.12	Those who are like his adversaries should be invited as priests.
2.150.13	Then he should take the others with a long stalk.
2.150.14	His enemies and foes are defeated, and he himself attains prosperity.
2.151.1	Now this is the Soma-sacrifice with intense Soma.
2.151.2	One who desires offspring should offer this sacrifice.
2.151.3	One who is without offspring is indeed like a skeleton.
2.151.4	A man who has offspring is intense, abundant.
2.151.5	"May I be strong and prosperous through offspring."
2.151.6	Some say, "One should offer this sacrifice if one desires cattle."
2.151.7	For one who has no cattle is indeed weak.
2.151.8	For a man is strong and prosperous through cattle.
2.151.9	"May I be strong through cattle."
2.151.10	It becomes of seventeen parts.
2.151.11	For he who is seventeen is indeed strong and prosperous.
2.151.12	"May I be strong and prosperous with offspring and cattle."
2.151.13	His two Sāmans are Bṛhat and Rathantara.
2.151.14	These indeed are Tīvra and Bahula, namely, the Bṛhat and the Rathantara.
2.151.15	"May I be strong with offspring and cattle and prosperous."
2.151.16	A pregnant mare is the fee.
2.151.17	This indeed is Tīvra and Bahlā, namely, a mare.
2.151.18	It is intense and abundant because of that.
2.151.19	It is intense and abundant when it is on both sides.
2.151.20	It is intensely and abundantly when one cow is able to give many cows.
2.151.21	"It is intense and abundantly because of offspring and cattle."
2.151.22	Some say, "The fee should be a hundred cows with different calves."
2.152.2	The gods sought him.
2.152.3	They did not find him.
2.152.4	They said, "Let us press (the Soma).
2.152.5	He will come then."
2.152.6	They pressed (the Soma). 
2.152.7	All the morning Soma-pressing did not come to them.
2.152.8	They used to raise the cups on their chests, saying, "Let us not eat the Soma of Indra who is absent."
2.152.9	He came to the midday pressing.
2.152.10	They cried out as one does when a chief has arrived.
2.152.11	They say that he came to the morning pressing at the end of the Acchāvāka's hymn.
2.152.12	Had he not come to the morning pressing, the sacrifice would have been interrupted.
2.152.13	Therefore they partake of the oblation of the Acchāvāka at this sacrifice.
2.152.14	Therefore the Adhvaryus and all the Camasādhvaryus take up the Acchāvakas.
2.152.15	They make a loud cry.
2.152.16	If prosperity should depart from him, he should offer with this (rite).
2.152.17	Prosperity departed from them, when their best departed.
2.152.18	They found her by means of this alone.
2.152.19	One who knows this finds prosperity and that prosperity does not depart from him.
2.153.1	There was a three-headed Tvashtra.
2.153.2	He had three faces, one for drinking Soma, one for drinking Surā, and one for eating food.
2.153.3	He sings with one, responds with one, announces with one, announces in return with one, praises with one.
2.153.4	He establishes the entire sacrifice with one alone, moving around.
2.153.5	He was of great prowess.
2.153.6	He was the son of Asuri.
2.153.7	He speaks directly to the gods and indirectly to the demons.
2.153.8	For he who desires more, he speaks to him indirectly.
2.153.9	Therefore Indra was afraid of him, because he was the son of a demon and because he was so powerful.
2.153.10	He thought: "The son of a demon is here."
2.153.11	He spoke to us directly and to the demons indirectly.
2.153.12	"Let us kill him."
2.154.1	He cut off his heads with a thunderbolt.
2.154.2	Those very ones became birds.
2.154.3	That which was the drinking of Soma, that became the Kapinjala.
2.154.4	Therefore he is like a tawny one.
2.154.5	For Soma is like a tawny (cow).
2.154.6	That which was drinking of Surā, that became the Kalavinka.
2.154.7	Therefore he cries out like a drunken one.
2.154.8	Now that which was the eating of food became the quail.
2.154.9	Therefore he is like many forms.
2.154.10	For food is like many forms,
2.154.11	Therefore that is his food, the scorpion, the centipede.
2.154.12	Tvashtra, whose son was killed, offered Soma without Indra.
2.154.13	He (Indra) looked at him and said, "If you go away from this sacrifice, you will be excluded from the sacrifice. You will be excluded from it. Therefore, let us kill him."
2.155.1	He (Indra) then rushed at him with a thunderbolt in his hand.
2.155.2	But Tvashtra fell back and approached his wives.
2.155.3	He (Indrat) could not follow him there.
2.155.4	Therefore, they yoke Tvashtra with his wives.
2.155.5	Therefore, one should not kill a woman who has sought refuge.
2.155.6	Udeya went to Indra.
2.155.7	He went to pour the Soma juice into the sacrificial pot and the pot for the Soma juice.
2.155.8	Having drunk it after pouring it into the pot for the soma juice, he departed.
2.155.9	Anudeya went to Tvashtra.
2.155.10	He asked, "Is there anything left over?"
2.155.11	They said, "This is the leaking (of Soma)."
2.155.12	Indra's enemy caused it to flow into the fire, saying, "Grow, svāhā!"
2.155.13	When he caused it to flow, that itself became Vṛtra.
2.155.14	While flowing, he merged with Agni and Soma.
2.155.15	Therefore they say, "Agni and Soma are Asuras."
2.155.16	He then rises up to the height of a man.
2.155.17	Then the earth becomes a mere puddle.
2.155.18	He then attains all the three Vedas, all prosperity, all food, and whatever is spoken in the Trirātra Sāman.
2.155.19	All this belongs to him.
2.155.20	The rivers carry his remains.
2.155.21	Then indeed the eight companions of the gods, the eight companions of Pitrs, the eight companions among men, the eight companions in the Asuras, were called the Abhiyuga.
2.155.22	Among them Indra, as the eighth, became the slayer of Vritra by his magic.
2.155.23	Therefore Indra himself struck him, for he made him turn by saying, "May Indra's enemy prosper, svāhā!" But when he was about to turn him, he said, "May Indra prosper, svāha!"
2.156.1	He would not have struck him down forever.
2.156.2	Indra, the king Soma, who had been drunk, struck him down without being invoked.
2.156.3	From all the holes, it went out, but not from the mouth.
2.156.4	Therefore, he was treated by a physician.
2.156.5	What went downward became the Suravaritaka (a kind of liquor).
2.156.6	What went out from the penis became the Parisruk (a kind of wine).
2.156.7	He vomited three times.
2.156.8	What he spat out first became the Karkandhu fruit, what he spat out second became the Badara fruit, what he spit out third became the Kvala fruit.
2.156.9	Therefore, these are the foods and tastes.
2.156.10	Having chewed the fourth, he spat it out.
2.156.11	That became the mango fruit.
2.156.12	When he was like this, the gods sat around him.
2.156.13	This was not the only hero.
2.156.14	He went like this:
2.156.15	"Where are we?"
2.156.16	He said, "We do not know where we are."
2.156.17	What for?
2.156.18	"I am about to sneeze."
2.156.19	Then, before that, they used to die after sneezing.
2.156.20	They said to him, "We will tell you to live by sneezing."
2.156.21	He sneezed.
2.156.22	They said to him, "You are alive."
2.156.23	He was indeed alive.
2.156.24	Therefore, even today, they call one who is breathing "alive."
2.156.25	Therefore, one should say to the one whom one thinks is breathing, "You are indeed alive."
2.157.1	They became the two lions.
2.157.2	The two tigers were from the eyes, the two jackals from the ears, the two foxes from the armpits.
2.157.3	Therefore these are the most vigorous of animals.
2.157.4	For Indra is the father of these.
2.157.5	And when he went downward, that became the small animal.
2.157.6	He was afflicted with a disease.
2.157.7	He was even covered with grass.
2.157.8	They said to him, "Where are you? Where should we treat you?"
2.157.9	Even today they ask one who is suffering from fever, "Where does it hurt you? Where should I treat you?"
2.157.10	He, pointing to the grass, said, "This is what is being cured for me."
2.157.11	They said to Agni, "Burn this."
2.157.12	Agni burned it.
2.157.13	They said to Parjanya, "Rain on this."
2.157.14	Parjanya rained on it.
2.157.15	The auspicious plants were born from that.
2.157.16	They nourished it with cows.
2.157.17	They milked it.
2.157.18	They saw this sacrifice.
2.157.19	They brought it.
2.157.20	They performed the sacrifice with it.
2.157.21	They brought the Prati-dhuk at the morning pressing.
2.157.22	"Because it was brought back, therefore it is called Prati-dhug."
2.157.23-27	It is called Śrita because it is used at the Madhyandina Savana. It is called Dadhi because it is used in the third Savana. He who has been a Soma-drinker or a Soma-purifier should offer this sacrifice. As he was before, so he becomes afterwards.
2.157.28	Therefore, one should not speak of Soma-drinking or Soma-purifying.
2.157.29	For Indra too is like that.
2.158.1	Now this is the Rta-drink.
2.158.2	The food and drink of the gods had escaped.
2.158.3	Soma-offering had escaped from them.
2.158.4	That itself is Viraj.
2.158.5	The gods said, "We desire to find this Viraj."
2.158.6	They performed austerities for that.
2.158.7	They saw that Viraj sacrifice.
2.158.8	They brought it.
2.158.9	They initiated themselves for it.
2.158.10	They ate on one day.
2.158.11	They saw the path of it.
2.158.12	They said, "Let us perform austerities more."
2.158.13	They ate on the second day.
2.158.14	They heard the sound of it.
2.158.15	They said, "Let us perform austerities again."
2.158.16	They fasted on the third day.
2.158.17	They saw her as a great mountain seen from afar, or as a great cloud.
2.158.18	They pursued her, going towards her and away from her.
2.158.19	He who pursues an animal, going towards it and away from it, does not catch it.
2.158.20	Now he who approaches him, whether going or coming, he alone seizes him.
2.158.21	He obtains it on the tenth day.
2.158.22	The Viraj has ten syllables.
2.158.23	Food is Viraj.
2.158.24	In order to obtain food.
2.159.1	Its vow is water and ghee.
2.159.2	Water is without a body, ghee is without a body. Water is without a body.
2.159.3	"With the bodyless one, the bodyless one (the sacrificer) has attained his own abode, the abode of the waters."
2.159.4	He offers the Vrata-milk.
2.159.5	This is the measure of a man; he should not offer the Vrata-oblation in excess of the man.
2.159.6	And indeed, here he joins the limbs of the self at the joints.
2.159.7	There is clarified butter in between for completeness.
2.159.8	The Stoma is seventeenfold.
2.159.9	Prajapati is seventeenfold.
2.159.10	Prajapati is the knower of the lost.
2.159.11	He who knows the lost, by him we obtain this world.
2.159.12	Of him both the Brihat and Rathantara are the Sāman. If in this world, by the Rathantara; if in the sky, by the Vamadevya; if in the other world, by the Brihat.
2.159.13	The Udumbara Soma-cup is the Dakṣiṇā. Udumbara is food, and food is strength; (it is given) for the securing of food and strength.
2.159.14	And also, Soma is without a body, and Svāhā is without a body; (it is offered) for the securing by one without a body of that which is without a body.
2.160.1	He gives it to the Brahman.
2.160.2	For the Brahman alone is the Dakṣinā.
2.160.3-9	They say, "It should be given when burnt, or when not burnt." They say, "It is to be given when not burnt." For if one were to give it when burnt, it would be useless. They say, it should be given when already burnt. For this is the share of the gods. Who is fit to give the share of the Gods? Therefore it should be given only when already burnt.
2.160.10	Whatever food he gives in this world, that food becomes for him in the other world.
2.160.11	This indeed is the supreme food in the other world, namely, the drinking of Soma.
2.160.12	This indeed becomes his Soma-offering in the other world and becomes food.
2.160.13	They eat, saying "Truth, truth."
2.160.14	For they found it through truth.
2.160.15	He says, "Truth is immortality."
2.160.16	For they found that immortality through truth.
2.160.17	"O Yis, O Jvara, O Yis, O Juhe," these are the two verses in the Sama-nidhana. They are the truth of speech.
2.160.18	For they found it through the truth of speech.
2.160.19	Then Gārgya Udiva, Kesi Dārbi, and Ṛjiśva Vātavat performed the sacrifice.
2.160.20	And Ṛjiśwa Vātavat went to them.
2.160.21	They approached him with the young boy Vṛṣaśuṣma, who was a son of Ṛjiśa, and who had been anointed. They thought, "If he succeeds, we will complete this with him."
2.160.22	He went to them.
2.161.7	He said, "Since you gave me more than I gave you, you have more than I have. How then is this world yours and that one mine?"
2.161.8	He said, "The world of the son of Vratopadhyay was indeed yours."
2.161.9	"You are the son of Vrataopadhyay.
2.161.10	Therefore this world is mine and that one yours."
2.161.11	He said, "Go." You will obtain whatever you desire. Your desire will be fulfilled."
2.161.12	"Make your fingers crooked."
2.161.13	He then went to the Brahmanas.
2.161.14	He then said, "Let there be a vessel for drinking water for the Brahmanas."
2.161.15	There was a vessel for drinking for the Brahmanas.
2.161.16	Then indeed this (world) is the later (one) of the two, the one with the Apipātra.
2.162.1	Now this is the Citti Stoma.
2.162.2	One who desires offspring should offer it.
2.162.3	It has the Stotras of the six-day Prsthya sacrifice. The Prstha days are the seasons.
2.162.4	The seasons are the year.
2.162.5	The year is procreation. He thinks, "May he who is procreation procreate me."
2.162.6	His Stotras are both odd and even.
2.162.7	This is the divine pair, the begetting, that the Stotras are both even and odd.
2.162.8	"He thinks, "May it beget me, that is the divine pair and begetting."
2.162.9	His Sāmans are both Brhat and Rathantara.
2.162.10	This is the divine pair, the begetting, that is, the Brihat and the Rathantara.
2.162.11	"May that which is the divine pair beget me."
2.162.12	It has twelve Stotras, twelve months are a year.
2.162.13	"The year is begetting, he who is begetting, may he beget me."
2.162.14	And there are twenty-four hymns of praise and prayers for him, for the year has twenty-four half-months.
2.162.15	"The year is procreation; may he who is procreation procreate me."
2.162.16	They say, "One should offer this sacrifice only if one desires heaven."
2.162.17	In the six-day Pañcadaśa sacrifice, the Stotras are as follows: The six-day Pañasdaśa sacrifice has Stotras in the form of the seasons.
2.162.18	The seasons are the year.
2.162.19	The year is the world of heaven; for the attainment of the world of heaven.
2.162.20	His Stotras are ascending; the world of heaven is ascending; for the attainment (of the world) of heaven.
2.162.21	Its two Sāmans are Brhat and Rathantara, which are heavenly; for the attainment, of the world of Heaven.
2.162.22	It has twelve Stotras; the year has twelve months.
2.162.23	The year is the world of heaven; for the attainment of the world of heaven.
2.162.24	It has twenty-four praises and eulogies, for the year has twenty-four half-months.
2.162.25	The year is the world heaven; for the attainmnet of the world of Heaven.
2.163.1	Its eulogies are in excess.
2.163.2	The Sacrificer has two feet.
2.163.3	He thus establishes the sacrificer in the heavenly world.
2.163.4	Some say that these should be placed on the bricks.
2.163.5	They are indeed heaven and earth, they are indeed the Brihat and Rathantara (Samans), they are indeed day and night, they are indeed Avashravas and Avashasanas.
2.163.6	Indeed this sacrifice is like a roof.
2.163.7-10	For the rain does not fall on the house of the one who knows this. Evil does not fall on him who knows this. And they say, "This is the only sacrifice that is performed in the course of the year." One who would perform a sacrifice with a fire that has been kindled for a year or less than a year should perform it with this.
2.163.11	Then his year is determined by the seasons, months, half-months, and nights.
2.163.12	Now, when the stomas of the six-day Pañcadaśa sacrifice are the seasons, then it is by the seasons.
2.163.13	And when there are twelve stotras, then it is in the months.
2.163.14	Now, as to why there are twenty-four hymns and praises, it is because the year consists of twenty-four half-months. By this (verse) it is by half-months.
2.163.15	Now, as to why the Stotriya (verse) consists of three hundred and sixty, it is because there are so many nights in the year. By this (it is) by nights.
2.163.16	He whose knowledge is thus, his year is indeed sought out immediately.
2.164.1-8	Now these two are the two groups of oblations. One who desires offspring should offer these two. Prajapati desired, "May I beget many offspring and cattle." "May I create the pairs of offspring and cattle." He saw these two sacrifices. He brought them. He offered them. Then he wasget many offspring and animals.
2.164.9	The Dvanda (Sāman) created offspring and cattle.
2.164.10	He who desires, 'May I beget many offspring and cattle, may I create offspring and cattle in pairs,' should offer these two.
2.164.11	He indeed begets many offspring and cattle and creates offspring and cattle in pair.
2.164.12	It is the forty-fourth (verse) and has the Rathantara as its Sama.
2.164.13	Brahma is the Rathantara, the Kshatra is the Catuścatvāriṃśa.
2.164.14	With Brahma and Kshatra, both yoked together, one becomes many with offspring and cattle.
2.164.15	Because these hymns became many, it is a heap.
2.164.16	The Aṣṭācatvāriṃsa is the Marayya, with the Brihat as the Sama.
2.164.17	Brahma is forty-eight, Bṛhat is the nobility.
2.164.18	For there are two Gāyatrī verses in it, which is forty-eight.
2.164.19	With Brahma and with the nobility, both yoked together, one becomes many with offspring and cattle, for offspring.
2.164.20	And because these hymns are greater than the others, therefore they are Marayus.
2.164.21	The Maras are indeed greater than the Rasas.
2.165.1	These two are the highest of the Stoma.
2.165.2	Those who have the highest Stoma, they become many with offspring and cattle.
2.165.3	Their initiation, purchase, and Upasads are together.
2.165.4	Having purchased, they are adorned separately.
2.165.5	The priests become separate.
2.165.6	They say, "This is indeed a confusion, if the priests are not the same."
2.165.7	"If one were to perform the sacrifice from a distance, it would be inauspicious."
2.165.8	"But what if the priests are the same, even if they are close?"
2.165.9	"No, they should not perform the sacrifice immediately. The priests should be different."
2.165.10	They indeed choose the same supreme (priest) and seek the same blessing.
2.165.11	Therefore, they should not be different.
2.165.12	Some say: Having performed the Rāśi sacrifice earlier, they should commence the consecration for the Marayā sacrifice after the Avabhṛtha.
2.165.13	These two would be like that.
2.165.14	Because the origin of Yama and Yama is the same, they are born together and grow together.
2.165.15	Therefore, they should be together.
2.165.16	These two performed the sacrifice for Ugrāyudha and Mānaścitta.
2.165.17	Then there was a quarrel between them. One hundred of them were on one side, and another hundred on the other.
2.165.18	Thus they became many.
2.165.19	He who knows this becomes many in progeny and cattle.
2.166.1	Then these Stotras, called Jyotis, Gauri, and Ayushi, come up.
2.166.2	Gauri and Ayushi were born.
2.166.3	Then Jyotis was born.
2.166.4	This world is the life, that world is the cow. This world is the light of the sky.
2.166.5	They made this world in front of them, as if it were a son.
2.166.6	This world is above here, that world is below here.
2.166.7	This light is raised up in front of them. By that we see.
2.166.8	They both went to the Yoga, and reached the end of the light.
2.166.9	It was like a father and mother following a son who had gone before them.
2.166.10	These are the Stotras which are in pairs, because they are yoked.
2.166.11	The son lies between the husband and wife.
2.166.12	Just as those two, when they are about to become a couple, would take a son from here or there, so is this.
2.166.13	These are the deficient and excessive stomas that generate offspring.
2.166.14	He who desires, 'May I beget many offspring and cattle,' should offer these.
2.166.15	He indeed begets many offspring and cattle.
2.167.1	Now this is the Stoma of Shunaskarna.
2.167.2	Shunaskarna, a Varshnyaka, was virtuous and sinless.
2.167.3	He desired, "Having done only good in this world and not evil, I shall go to heaven."
2.167.4	He saw this sacrifice.
2.167.5	He brought it.
2.167.6	He performed it.
2.167.7-10	Then he, having done only good deeds and not bad deeds in this world, went to the heavenly world. He who desires to do only good deeds and no bad deeds in this life and go to the heavenly world, should offer this sacrifice. He does only good deeds and does no bad deeds in his life and goes to the heavenly world.
2.167.11	It is as if he were to go away.
2.167.12	The Trivrt stoma is indeed the heaven world, which is well-polished.
2.167.13	By this one goes to the heaven world.
2.167.14	His stotras are indeed going away, his hymns are going away, his psalms are going away, the praises are going away.
2.167.15	He becomes indeed going away.
2.167.16	They praise him in the Pravartinī verses. They thus send him to the other world.
2.168.1	His Prstha is Vamadevya. It is Svara.
2.168.2	All the Svara verses are assigned to it.
2.168.3	Svara is the breath.
2.168.4	The Udgātṛ thus makes the breath of the sacrificer sound with his breath.
2.168.5	They say that one should sit down with the back to the Gārhapatya, covering it with the southern part of the body, at the Stotra of the Yajñāyajñiya hymn.
2.168.6	One then goes to heaven.
2.168.7	They say that the sacrifice becomes defective if one sits down before the rites are completed.
2.168.8	When all the rites are completed and when the Vashas are performed,
2.168.9	Then, having turned to the right, he should lie down with his buttocks towards the Ahavaniya fire.
2.168.10	Then he goes to heaven.
2.168.11	The Ahavaniya fire is indeed the sun.
2.168.12	This indeed is the heavenly world.
2.168.13	He indeed stands at the end in that heavenly world.
2.169.1	Now this is the Manu Stoma.
2.169.2	Manu and Yama were together in Vaivasvata's time.
2.169.3	He desired, "May the gods give him (Yama) the kingdom of this world, and me the kingdom of the other world."
2.169.4	He saw this sacrifice.
2.169.5	He brought it.
2.169.6	He performed it.
2.169.7	Then the gods gave him the kingdom of this (world), and him the kingdom of the next (world).
2.169.8	It is indeed a ten-fold (sacrifice).
2.169.9	For this (sacrifice) is indeed a tenfold (sacrifice).
2.169.10	Just as one would take out with tongs, so he took him out with these tongs from this world to the other world.
2.169.11	His Rathantara is the background.
2.169.12	The Rathantara is indeed the thunderbolt.
2.169.13	With the thunderbolt he thus struck him from this world to that other world.
2.169.14	If one has an enemy, if one wants to attack, if one wants rivalry, one should offer this sacrifice. With the thunderbolt he thus hurls him from this world to the other world.
2.169.15	In that (sacrifice) these terrible things are prescribed.
2.170.1	"The seven-day sacrifice of Jamadagni, the running, the eyes."
2.170.2	The forms of the hymns which are to be recited are the same.
2.170.3	They make the Stoma complete by means of that form.
2.170.4	Some say, "One should offer sacrifice with this for the sake of food."
2.170.5	All others praise Viraj.
2.170.6	He alone does not praise Viraj who praises with ten hymns.
2.170.7	Viraj has ten syllables.
2.170.8	Viraja is food.
2.170.9	For the securing of food.
2.170.10	Its Prstha is Rathantara. Food is Rathantara. For the securing of the food.
2.170.11	In it they arrange these Sama-s, Arkar Arka-flower, Daigha-shrava. Those are the forms of food.
2.170.12	They make the Stoma complete by that form.
2.171.1	Now this is the Gayatri.
2.171.2	In it, the morning pressing has three stomas, the midday pressing fifteen, the evening pressing seventeen, and the third pressing twenty-one.
2.171.3	The sacrifice is with Uktha and both Samans.
2.171.4	One who desires to be a Purodha should offer this sacrifice.
2.171.5	Now, when at the morning pressing the Ajya of the Acchāvāka is of three and fifteen (verses), then the Brahman is of three, the Kshatra is of fifteen; he thus places the Kshatra before the Brahman.
2.171.6	Therefore the Brahman is the Purohita of the Kshatriya.
2.171.7	And he makes the Kshatra follow the Brahman.
2.171.8	The midday pressing is of seventeen (verses).
2.171.9	Vid is the seventeenth.
2.171.10	This indeed is the second king, namely, the Purohita.
2.171.11	He who attains prosperity goes to the lordship of the Visas.
2.171.12	In order to go to the lordship of Visas, the midday pressing becomes the seventeenth.
2.171.13	And this indeed is the support of the Brahman and the Kshatra.
2.172.1	His Rathantara is the Prastara, the Brihat the Brahma-sastra.
2.172.2	Brahma is the Rathantara.
2.172.3	The Kshatra is the Brihat.
2.172.4	He thus places the Kshatra before the Brahma.
2.172.5	Therefore the Brahman is the Purohita of the Kshatriya.
2.172.6	And he makes the Kshatra follow the Brahma.
2.172.7	It becomes the Ukthya.
2.172.8	The Ukthyas are the Vidyas.
2.172.9	This indeed is the second king, namely, the Purohita.
2.172.10	He who attains prosperity goes to the lordship of the Vis.
2.172.11	"He goes to the lordship and sovereignty of the Vis." Therefore it is Ukthya.
2.172.12	And this indeed is the common ground for the Brahman and the Kshatra.
2.172.13	They are twenty-one in number.
2.172.14	The twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and this sun are twenty-one.
2.172.15	This indeed is prosperity.
2.172.16	He indeed ascends that prosperity at the end.
2.172.17	He indeed becomes all, and attains the Gayatri.
2.172.18	The Gayatri indeed is Brahman.
2.172.19	When he prospers in the Brahmic lustre, then he goes to be his Purohita.
2.172.20	When he goes to be the Purohita, then he may desire: "May I be the Purohita of this one without being separated from him." Then he should offer the Brahmanaschinna oblation of clarified butter on the fifteenth day of this one. That is
2.172.21	Brahma is threefold,
2.172.22	Kshatra is fifteenfold,
2.172.23	This is the Brahman's twofold protection.
2.172.24	He who knows this becomes the Purohita of the king and does not fall away.
2.173.1	Now this is Gautama's four-stoma (sacrifice).
2.173.2	Gautama desired, 'May I obtain animals and go to the world of animals.'
2.173.3	He saw this sacrifice.
2.173.4	He brought it.
2.173.5	He performed it.
2.173.6	Then indeed he (the sacrificer) obtained the animals and the earth of the animals.
2.173.7	He who desires, 'May I obtain the animals and the land of the animals', he should offer this sacrifice.
2.173.8	He indeed obtains the animals and the animals' land.
2.173.9	His Bahispavamāna (hymn) is in four (verses).
2.173.10	The horses are four-footed and have four hoofs.
2.173.11	Those animals which are four-footed, and have four hoots, he wins them by this (offering).
2.173.12	The offerings of butter are eight each.
2.173.13	Animals have eight hoots.
2.173.14	Those animals that have eight hoots, he gains them by this (oblation).
2.173.15	The midday (oblation) is twelvefold.
2.173.16	The Jagatī has twelve syllables.
2.173.17	The Jagatī is the animals.
2.173.18	What is small among animals, that is the Jagatī.
2.173.19	He thus wins it.
2.173.20	There are sixteen Prstha (verses).
2.173.21	Animals have sixteen parts, those we know and those we do not.
2.173.22	He thus gains them in their parts.
2.173.23	Savimsa is the Pavamāna of the Arbhava (Stoma).
2.173.24	These two are the twenty-fold Viraj, since there are twenty.
2.173.25	Animals are the twenty-foundation Viraj.
2.173.26	Those animals which are the twenty- foundation Viraj, he wins them by this (sacrifice).
2.173.27	Then the twenty-four Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
2.173.28	Animals are four-footed, the Viraj.
2.173.29	Those who are the four-footed animals, the Vairajas, he wins them by this (rite).
2.173.30	And the year consists of twenty-four half-months.
2.173.31	By the year he thus encloses them and places them in himself.
2.173.32	For this is neither an Agniṣṭoma nor an Ukthya, but both.
2.174.6	He performed this sacrifice.
2.174.7	Then he became very prosperous with progeny and cattle.
2.174.8	There was no one else before him.
2.174.9	He who desires, "May I become very prosperous with progeny, and may there be no one else before me," should perform this sacrifice.
2.174.10	He indeed becomes very prosperous with progeny. There is no one else before.
2.174.11	It has three parts and is chanted to the Rathantara tune.
2.174.12	There is no other Stoma than the Trivrit, no other Prastara than the Rathantara, no other deity than Prajapati.
2.174.13	Because these are the foremost, therefore it is the foremost.
2.174.14	And Prajapati is the mind.
2.174.15	There is nothing else before the mind.
2.174.16	Therefore it is the foremost.
2.174.17	It is three-fold. The three-fold is deficient.
2.174.18	The deficient is procreation. He thinks, 'May it be procreation, may it procreate me.'
2.174.19	Its Rathantara Sāman is the procreative. The Rathantara is procreation.
2.174.20	It has twelve Stotras. The year has twelve months.
2.175.2	The Maruts desired: "May we be the most powerful, the strongest, the most numerous, the most vigorous among the gods; may we conquer heaven."
2.175.3	They saw this sacrifice.
2.175.4	They brought it.
2.175.5	They performed it.
2.175.6	Then they became the most powerful, strongest, most numerous, most vigorous among the Gods; they conquered heaven.
2.175.7	He becomes the most vigorous, the most powerful, the most numerous, the most heroic among his kinsmen; he wins heaven. He who knows this.
2.175.8	This indeed is the sacrifice of the clans.
2.175.9	The Maruts are the clans; therefore the sacrifice of the clan.
2.175.10	With this very sacrifice, Ekya of the Kandu family performed.
2.175.11	He was the most powerful, the strongest, the most numerous, and the most heroic among his own people. He conquered or did not conquer the world.
2.175.12	He becomes seventeen. Prajapati is seventeen.
2.175.13	Prajapati is procreation. May he who is procreation procreate me."
2.175.14	His Rathantara is the Prstha. The Rathantara is generation. He thinks, "May it generate me."
2.175.15	It becomes Ukthya. Animals are Ukthas. He thinks, “May I be with animals.”
2.176.1	His five seasons and five animals are sprinkled and wander.
2.176.2	Now, since the five-year-old animals with five limbs are sprinkled and wander, therefore it is five-year-olds.
2.176.3	They are all speckled.
2.176.4	Some say that the Maruts are the sons of Prisni.
2.176.5	But it is said in a verse: "The Maruts are the children of Prisni."
2.176.6	Therefore they are speckled.
2.176.7	The sacrifice of the gods is indeed strength.
2.176.8	They took it from the Ātmans themselves.
2.176.9	When it is from the Maruts, they place strength in themselves.
2.176.10	"To the Maruts who are Ujjeshi, to the Maruts who sleep, to the Marut who are self-existent, to the Marus themselves, to the Maruds who are Abhiști."
2.176.11	Now, when he says, "To the Maruts who are victorious," it is as if he were to win that desire. One should offer to the Maruts who have won, if one desires to win.
2.176.12	Now, when he says "To the Marut who are self-possessed," it is as though he were to attain that desire which is self-possessed. One should offer for the Maruts who possess themselves, if one desires self-possession.
2.176.13	Now, the Maruts are indeed all this self.
2.176.14	He thus pleases them with their own (share).
2.176.15	When pleased, they return to him.
2.176.16	With that which is returned he performs the sacrifice. And when he says, 'To the Maruts, to the Maruts,'
2.177.1	for there are many Maruts, those whom we know and those whom we do not know.
2.177.2	All of them were pleased with us.
2.177.3	Now, if one were to perform the sacrifice to the Maruts and the Abhiṣṭis, one would attain one's desired goal. One should perform this sacrifice for that purpose.
2.177.4	One should offer these animals.
2.177.5	One should sacrifice one animal on the Upavasatha day, one on the Prasūta day, one on Anūbandhyā day, one on Udavasānīyā day, and one on the Upavāsa day. One should offer these animals in this way.
2.177.6	Now some say that it should be only five days.
2.177.7	There they should offer these animals every day."
2.177.8	Then Udara Sandilya asked the elder Ekayavana, who was engaged in a debate, "What is this? Some say it should be only for five days, others say it should be for one Ukthya and seventeen days. How is it?"
2.177.9	He said, "They have informed us of the Ukthya alone, the one-day sacrifice with seventeen (Stotras)."
2.177.10	Now some say, "This should be an Atiratra."
2.177.11	How can the sacrifice be performed for five years and not be an Atirattra?
2.177.12	That is not so.
2.177.13	Some say, "It should be an Agnistoma."
2.177.14	All the sacrificial rites are based on the Agniṣṭoma.
2.177.15	But that is not so.
2.177.16	It should be the Saptadaśa Ukthya.
2.177.17	The Ukthyas are the Vidyas.
2.177.18	The Saptadaśa is the Vidyā.
2.177.19	The sacrifice is the Vidyās.
2.177.20	Therefore, it should be the Sapta-daśa Ukth ya.
2.177.21	The Maruts and the Sun, and the Maruts and the Stobha, these two are the prescribed Sāman songs for the Pavamāna hymns.
2.177.22	They thus make the Stoma grow in its form.
2.178.1	Now this is the Abhijit (hymn).
2.178.2	The gods and the Asuras were contending in these worlds, in this world.
2.178.3	Those gods desired: "We shall conquer the worlds, we shall conquer the Asuras, we shall conquer our rivals."
2.178.4	They saw this sacrifice.
2.178.5	They brought it.
2.178.6	They performed it.
2.178.7	By that they conquered these worlds, they conquered their rivals, the Asuras.
2.178.8	The reason why they conquered these worlds is that they conquered them.
2.178.9	He who knows this conquers the worlds, conquers rivalry, conquers his hostile kinsmen.
2.178.10	His Stotras have three extra verses. There are three worlds, for the conquest of these worlds.
2.178.11	They are sung four times, for the four directions.
2.178.12	They are sung in the Abhivatīṣu (sāman), for the conquest of these worlds.
2.178.13	The Ābhīka, Abhinidhana, Abhivart, and Ābhīśava are the Sāmans. They are sung for the conquest of the worlds.
2.179.1	His Rathantara is the Prstha, the Vamadevya is the Maitravaruna-sastra, the Brihat is the Pavamana of the Arbhava.
2.179.2	This (earth) is the Rathantara,
2.179.3	the Vamadevya the atmosphere,
2.179.4	the Brihat the heaven.
2.179.5	For the conquest of these worlds which are not separated.
2.179.6	In that (sacrifice) they imagine the remote forms of the Vishvajit (sacrifice) for the purpose of counteracting (the effects of the Vishva-jit).
2.179.7	Indra indeed slew Vritra.
2.179.8	While he was slaying that Vritra, darkness enveloped him from these worlds.
2.179.9	He desired, 'I should remove this darkness.'
2.179.10	He saw this Abhijit sacrifice.
2.179.11	He brought it.
2.179.12	He performed it.
2.179.13	His Stoma is three plus one.
2.179.14	There are three worlds.
2.179.15	By that he removed darkness from these worlds.
2.179.16	And he enveloped the darkness from the fourth world.
2.179.17	He desired, 'I should remove this darkness.'
2.179.18	He saw this sacrifice, the Viśvajit.
2.179.19	He brought it.
2.179.20	He performed it.
2.179.21	And his Stoma is four plus one.
2.179.22	There are four directions.
2.179.23	This indeed is the fourth world, namely, the directions.
2.179.24	By that he removed darkness from the fourth world.
2.179.25	Then he removed darkness and sin from all these worlds and ascended to the heavenly world.
2.179.26	Having removed darkness and sin from all these worlds, he ascends to the heavenly world, he who knows this.
2.180.1	Now this is the Vishvajiti (sacrifice).
2.180.2	Indra conquered the Asuras.
2.180.3	He did not conquer them like a king.
2.180.4	The gods performed this sacrifice for him.
2.180.5	He conquered the entire universe.
2.180.6	Indra is the conqueror of the universe.
2.180.7	Whatever he conquered by this art,
2.180.8	That is the nature of the Viśvajit.
2.180.9	The gods, being afraid of the Asuras, having taken all this, ascended to the heavenly world.
2.180.10	He who, having obtained all, does not give all, he is the giver of all loss.
2.180.11	But he who, having obtained everything, gives everything, he is the knower of all.
2.180.12	He who wins all the Stotras, all the Grahas, all the Prsthas, all the metres, wins everything.
2.180.13	His Stotras are four plus one.
2.180.14	He conquers these worlds with three.
2.180.15	The fourth one makes all the worlds his wives.
2.180.16	The union of the verses is with the same deities. They are united with that, with that form.
2.180.17	They say, "Those who proceed with the Pavamana verses go on a path that is not the right one."
2.180.18	"Your Pavamana verses are the sages," it says. There is a repetition.
2.180.19	They return to the right path.
2.180.20	Four do not become six.
2.180.21	They become divided.
2.181.1-6	Then these are the offerings of ghee. Prajapati created beings. Having created them, he thought, "I am lacking." He saw these offerings of ghee. With them he satisfied himself for the sake of completeness. One who gives everything is indeed lacking.
2.181.7	Now, the reason why these oblations of ghee are offered is that the sacrificer, by means of them, refreshes himself for the sake of non-exhaustion.
2.181.8	They say, "These (sacrifices) are indeed successful with life."
2.181.9	Those who offer these sacrifices of different forms, different deities and different metres in the same sacrificial rite.
2.181.10	Now, the Brihat (hymn) is among the Gāyatrī verses. The Brihat is indeed the Prāṇa.
2.181.11	The Gāyatrī is the Prāṇa; they prosper through the Prāṇas.
2.181.12	If the Prsthas are performed in the proper order, and the Revatī verses are placed at the end, then the Revatī hymns are in their proper form. By that alone, the Revatī forms are not transgressed.
2.181.13	They say, "Those who perform the Triṃśa stoma go beyond the Agniṣṭoma Sāman."
2.181.14	These verses have twenty-one syllables.
2.181.15	They do not go beyond the Agnișṭoma Sāma.
2.181.16	They say, "Those performing the Brhat Agniṣṭoma Sama go beyond the Yajñāyajñiya."
2.181.17	Now, when he says, "O Agni, thou art the Hotri of sacrifices," then they do not go to the forms of the Yajyayajiyas, and then they do not proceed to the third pressing.
2.181.18	They say, "He indeed prospers with cattle, who gives everything."
2.182.1	He puts on a reddish-brown skin.
2.182.2	This is indeed the dear form of cattle, that it is reddish.
2.182.3	He prospers with the cattle in their dear form.
2.182.4	He digs with the spade, which is without a handle, and conquers the enemy.
2.182.5	The spade has two edges, and thus he wins food on both sides.
2.182.6	He dwells in the forest for three nights. The food that is in the forest, that he wins with them.
2.182.7	The three (kinds of) food which are neither in the village nor in the forest, that is the same as those (three).
2.182.8	The three (kinds of food) which are in the people, that is the food of the people.
2.182.9	The three (foods) which are in society, that is the society's food.
2.182.10	They become twelve.
2.182.11	Twelve months are a year.
2.182.12	He obtains food from the year.
2.182.13	He puts on the skin of Rohini.
2.182.14	This is the skin of animals, which is on the body of man.
2.182.15	Those animals cannot bear the heat, rain, ten days, and mosquitoes.
2.182.16	They approached the man and said, "This is your skin. It is ours."
2.182.17	What will happen then?"
2.182.18	They said, "We will be your first."
2.182.19	They gave him a garment, saying, "This is your garment."
2.182.20	In that he puts on the red-coloured skin, he prospers with his own form.
2.182.21	Thus indeed, in the other world, the cattle do not bite him.
2.182.22	Cattle indeed do not bite a man in the other world.
2.182.23	Therefore, one should not be naked at the end of a cow.
2.182.24	"May the Lord depart from this skin of his."
2.183.1	It is with the tail, for completeness.
2.183.2	And indeed all of us are offspring of Prajapati.
2.183.3	He who among your sons is the most miserly, he severs his father's heart.
2.183.4	He goes to the knowledge of Prajapati, saying, "He who gives everything goes to miserliness."
2.183.5	Those who live in the forest should live in the Udumbara.
2.183.6	When Prajapati divided the food and nourishment among his creatures, what remained over was this tree.
2.183.7	The Udumbara is nourishment, food.
2.183.8	He who gives everything away has his food and nourishment in the forest.
2.183.9	He who is the part of Prajapati, and the food,
2.183.10	he indeed obtains that by them.
2.183.11	And those who do not live in a village or in the forest, they indeed live among the Niṣādas.
2.183.12	For these indeed are neither in a village nor in the forest, namely the Niṣāḍas.
2.183.13	By these indeed one obtains both kinds of food, namely the food of the village and the food of the forest.
2.183.14	He who is the part of Prajapati, and the food, that he wins by them.
2.183.15	If one lives among the people, among the Vaishyas or among the enemies,
2.183.16	This indeed is the people of the Brahman, whether the Vaishya or the enemy.
2.183.17	One whose food and livelihood are taken away by the people, is he who gives everything.
2.183.18	He who is the part of Prajapati, he obtains that food by means of them.
2.183.19	If one were to live among the people, one should live among the king.
2.183.20	For this is the people, namely the king.
2.183.21	The prosperity of food is at the end, and he establishes the prosperity of food at the end.
2.184.1	Prajapati created beings.
2.184.2	He created this world by this very same Viśvajit.
2.184.3	And because these (verses) have different forms, therefore this world is of different forms.
2.184.4	This is the union of the Prstha (verses).
2.184.5	The Rathantara is yoked with the Upati (verses).
2.184.6	Sarasvatī, Vairaj, Sārasvatī, Mahānāmnī, Brāhmaṇaspatyā, Vaivarūpa, Sāvitrī, Revatī, Agnipāvamānī, Bṛhat.
2.184.7	Now, why are these of different forms?
2.184.8	They are the Pratipads at the morning pressing.
2.184.9	They ascend to the midday pressing.
2.184.10	They say, "Those who undertake the Pavasvini rites are indeed successful in life."
2.184.11	And because this is the Vayu rite, they are successful in life, for Vayu is life.
2.185.1	Now these are the Sarasvati and Sarasvati rites.
2.185.2	The divine couple Sarasvati and Sarasvatl are indeed the begetters.
2.185.3	By the divine pair, for the offspring.
2.185.4	They say that the male should be done first, and the female afterwards.
2.185.5	So that the sacrificer may not be timid, and offspring may be born.
2.185.6	They say, indeed, that Vayu is the bearer of semen,
2.185.7	Sarasvati is the generation.
2.185.8	They generate the Sarasvata from the pair.
2.185.9	Or, indeed, the cow is the first to run, and the bull follows. It should be done first for Sarasvati.
2.185.10	This is indeed the case. It should be performed first for Sarasvati alone.
2.185.11	Now this is the Brahmaspatya step.
2.185.12	Prajapati created the offspring without Brahma. Those created by him went away.
2.185.13	He saw this Brahmanaspatya step.
2.185.14	With that he created the progeny of Brahma.
2.185.15	Those created by him did not perish.
2.185.16	In that this is the Brahmanaspatya (step), with that he creates the progeny of Brahma, those created by him do not perish.
2.186.1	Then the Savitri-born ones.
2.186.2	Whatever form of the universe these various forms have come to, may that be ours, blessed by Savitar.
2.186.3	Now the Agni Pavamānas.
2.186.4	They go like a path, those who proceed with the Pavamānas."
2.186.5	Agni is the path-maker of the deities.
2.186.6	Whichever way one goes, one goes making a path.
2.186.7	Now, the Agni-Pāvamānī is the first step. By Agni itself they go around the path.
2.186.8	The verse "O Pavamāna, your poets" is a circumambulation.
2.186.9	They go around the path again.
2.186.10	He who knows the leader of the Prstha (hymn) becomes the leader of his own people.
2.186.11	The Prstha (sūktas) are indeed the leader of the Vaimāntaka (sūktas).
2.186.12	He who knows this becomes the best of his friends.
2.187.1	They say, "This is like doing something bad, for the Brihat and Rathantara are on either side of the middle Prstha."
2.187.2	"Just as a better person would sit below a worse person sitting above, so it is like this, for the Brihāt and Rathantara are around the middle Prsthas."
2.187.3	The Brihat and Rathantara should be in the middle, with the other Stotras around them, for the exclusion of the Pāpāvasya.
2.187.4	And as the better one sits above, the worse one below, so it is when the Brihat and Rathantara are in the middle, and the other Stotras are around them.
2.187.5	But it would not be so if all the Stotras were not in the middle.
2.187.6	Of all the Prastara-verses, the Viraj is the first to be recited.
2.187.7	If one is asked about the last verse of the Prastara, one should say "No".
2.187.8	The Brihat and Rathantara should be recited in between the Prastara verses for the sake of all the Prastaras.
2.187.9	This is the Rathantara, that is the Brihat.
2.187.10	The Prastara verses are the animals.
2.187.11	By these two worlds he encloses the animals on both sides for protection.
2.187.12	He whose knowledge is thus, his wealth is not taken away by others.
2.188.1	And as a father is to a son, so are the Brhat and Rathantara; as sons are to a father, so are the Prstha Stotras.
2.188.2	What a son does in excess, the father is his pacifier, the father is the restrainer.
2.188.3	Now, the reason why the Brhat and Rathantara are placed together is for the sake of peace and protection.
2.188.4	And as the parents would surround their sons, so are the Brhat and the Rathantara placed together, with the Prastara in the middle.
2.188.5	Just as if the bulls or the enemies were to stand up in a rage, so are these middle-most backs. And why the two are on either side of the Naudhasa (cup) is this:
2.188.6	The Naudhasa is indeed Brahman.
2.188.7	Having thus appeased them with Brahman, they make them quiet with the Shyaita (cup) above.
2.188.8	Therefore, the Naudhasam should be at the beginning and the Shyait at the end.
2.188.9	They say, "The concluding verses of the Prastara are the same. By what is the Ajami (verse) composed?"
2.188.10	"Vairaja, Maha-namana, Vairupa, and Revati - by this account, it is Ajami."
2.188.11	And also because these have the same concluding verses in the middle, it is so.
2.188.12	In that (Satra) there are three, seventeen.
2.188.13	Those are fifty-one Stotriya (verses).
2.188.14	That is the morning pressing of the cow.
2.188.15	One hundred and ninety-one nights, that is the night of the Jyotishtoma.
2.188.16	That is indeed the union, the generation, which is done.
2.188.17	He is born with union, who knows thus.
2.188.18	Those two become fifty-one Stotrīya (verses).
2.188.19	That is Viraj.
2.188.20	Food is Viraj. The food is Viraj. That Viraj is the food.
2.188.21	Viraj indeed is the food. At the end of the sacrifice, it is established in the food.
2.189.1	The gods and the Asuras were contending.
2.189.2	Then indeed, at that time, these arts were in Prajapati alone, not in the other gods.
2.189.3	Indra approached Prajapati, saying, "May I conquer the Asuras."
2.189.4	Therefore he gave him that art.
2.189.5	He released it to him.
2.189.6	Just as one would release a necklace, a gem, or a garland, so he released the body.
2.189.7	Therefore he created this art and these verses.
2.189.8	And what other brilliance there was, by which he shines,
2.189.9	Knowing this form, the Asuras said, "Our father is killing us! Our father is killing us!" and were defeated.
2.189.10	Then indeed the gods became victorious, the Asuras defeated.
2.189.11	One becomes victorious over one's own self, one's enemy becomes defeated, he who knows this.
2.190.1	They say, "One should not praise too much."
2.190.2	Just as one would release a gold ornament, a gem, or a garland, and then release it again, so is it when one performs the Agniṣṭoma.
2.190.3	One who wins either of the two worlds wins all.
2.190.4	The day and night are all the worlds.
2.190.5	And just as one who climbs to the top of a great tree and cannot find a way back down, so is it with the Agniṣṭomam.
2.190.6	Now, the Stotras are in a descending order. The Atirātra is the entire foundation. By it he stands firm in it.
2.190.7	They say, "Those who perform the Atirātra, they indeed fall away from this world."
2.190.8	Now, the Brihat (Stoma) is in the Gāyatrī verses. This (earth) is the Gāyatrīs. He stands firm in it.
2.191.1	Now, just as a wheel is fitted to an axle, so all these arts are fitted to the Brahman. Those who perform the Brihat Agniṣṭoma Sāman in the Gāyatrī verses.
2.191.2	Therefore, the Brihat Agniștoma Sāman should be performed in the Gāyatri verses alone.
2.191.3	They say, "One should give a thousand." That is the same as "all."
2.191.4	They also say, "One may give as many as there are verses in the Visvajit Stotra."
2.191.5	That is the same as all."
2.191.6	They also state, "One should only give what one has."
2.191.7	What one destroys, that is sin.
2.191.8	Just as it flows from the pair, so it flows from him from all evil. What he destroys.
2.191.9	Therefore everything should be given.
2.192.1	Now this is the Vājapeya.
2.192.2	One who desires food should offer the Vājapeye.
2.192.3	Indeed, the Vājapeyi is the desire for food.
2.192.4	Food is Vāja.
2.192.5	When a cow, a horse, a man, and food are well-fed, then it becomes a prize.
2.192.6	One desiring brahmic glory should offer the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice. Agniṣṭoma is indeed Brahman. For the attainment of brahmic glory.
2.192.7	One is indeed anointed for the sake of the seasons and animals.
2.192.8	His five Stotras should be thirty-four in number, all Pavamana Stotras, and both Brahma and Sama.
2.192.9	So many are the Stotras of the Ukthya.
2.192.10	They attain that desire which is in the Ukthya,
2.192.11	They do not go from the Agniṣṭoma.
2.192.12	For this Agniṣṭoma is neither Ukthya nor Ṣoḍaśin nor Atiratra.
2.192.13	This is an additional sacrifice.
2.192.14	Prajapati is indeed additional.
2.192.15	This sacrifice is of Prajapati.
2.192.16	For the attainment of Prajapati itself.
2.192.17	For it, there is a verse beginning with "Brihat".
2.192.18	Animals are indeed Shipi-vistas.
2.192.19	The Kshatriya is Brihat.
2.192.20	This world is of the Kshatriya.
2.192.21	May the animals stand in the world of this our worldly hymn.
2.192.22	They praise in Tristubh, the Brihat (hymn).
2.192.23	The Tristubh is the Kshatra.
2.192.24	One who is consecrated with the Kshatra is consecrated.
2.192.25	The Vaisnavas praise (Vishnu) thus: "Vishnu is the supreme deity among the deities. He is being consecrated with the supreme deity."
2.192.26	They run the race for the attainment of Prajapati and the conquest of the heavenly world.
2.192.27	They run the races with seventeen posts.
2.192.28	Prajapati is indeed seventeenfold.
2.192.29	This sacrifice is of Prajapati, for the attainment of Prajapati.
2.193.1	They say, they should run in the three recitations.
2.193.2	For there are three breaths: the prāṇa, apāna and vyāna.
2.193.3	For the continuity of them, for their non-interruption.
2.193.4	Others say, they should only run in one recitation.
2.193.5	For who is this, that is prāṇa, that is apāna, that is vyāna?
2.193.6	They say, they should run in all the praises, for the sake of not mixing these two kinds of clarified butter.
2.193.7	They say, those who run outside the altar, after the offspring have been born, they go away from the sacrifice.
2.193.8	The sacrifice is only as big as it is inside the altar.
2.193.9	They should run from the altar's end.
2.193.10	Then he says, "Having placed the foot on the side of the chariot, he should again take it back."
2.193.11	That is called both running and not running.
2.193.12	They say, "They should run."
2.193.13	One wins the divine race with the Rathantara and the human race with the chariot.
2.193.14	Therefore they should run in these two races for victory."
2.193.15	Brahma, seated on the wheel of the chariot, sang the Sama, and reached the strength, O strong one.
2.193.16	They reached the strength, the strong ones.
2.193.17	The immortal one. Food is strength. For the securing of food.
2.193.18	He sings while moving.
2.193.19	For while moving one goes to the place where one wishes to go.
2.193.20	One gives a horse.
2.193.21-27	This is indeed the share of Vayu. This entire (universe) belongs to Prajapati. This sacrifice is connected with Prajapati; it is indeed for attaining Prajapati. He gives seventeen times seventeen (cows). Prajapati is indeed seventeenfold. This sacrifice belongs to Prajapatı; it is indeed to attain Prajapati. Its morning pressing is undefined.
2.193.28	Prajapati is not defined.
2.193.29	This sacrifice is of Prajapati, for the attainment of Prajapati.
2.193.30	The midday pressing is of the Vaja (kind).
2.193.31	For this is the Vajapeya.
2.193.32	The third pressing is of the Citra (kind).
2.193.33	This sacrifice is the most Citra.
2.193.34	The Gāyatrī verses of the midday Pavamāna are those which have the word 'andhas' (blind) in them.
2.194.6	When consecrated with the Ksatra, one is consecrated.
2.194.7	Now the form of Abhikam Abhiksit.
2.194.8	"Purifying, O Soma, I hold," the Brihatī has both forms.
2.194.9	This is the Udyaya with both Sāmans.
2.194.10	Therefore they perform this, they perform the Brihat and Rathantara Sāmans.
2.194.11	Among them, the Raurava is known as the Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
2.194.12	"The Agniṣṭoma sāman is known, lest we should be deprived of it."
2.194.13	Then the Vājajit. Food is indeed the Vājas, for the securing of food.
2.194.14	Then the Daighaśravas. Food is indeed Daighaśrava, for the securing food.
2.194.15	Then the Arka-flower, or food, for the securing of food.
2.194.16	Then the Samant.
2.194.17	"He is the Samant, the prosperity, the non-existent."
2.194.18	Then the Yaudhajayam, the Triṇidhāna, for the establishment of the Savanas.
2.194.19	Then the Ausham, the last Sāman, with the last Sāma, we have attained the last heavenly world.
2.194.20	Then the Rathantara.
2.194.21	Brahma is the Rathantara.
2.194.22-27	This is the Brahma-sava. One is consecrated by Brahma, one is consecrated by the consecration. Then the Vamadevya, the auspicious, the peaceful, the well-breathing, one follows the course. Then the Naudhasa, the Prajnat, the Brahma-saman. The Prajnat Brahma-saman, lest we should be obstructed.
2.194.28	Then, "At what time did he sleep?"
2.194.29	Then, "At what season did Susvān eat?" Then, "That time-eater, who was his time-eater?"
2.194.30	"Which is your best intoxication?" The verses of the Pavamāna Soma are in the Andhasvatī metre.
2.194.31	Andha means food.
2.195.8	These (verses) are for the one who gives food, for the securing of food.
2.195.9	Then (the verse) addressed to Vāravantīya. Prosperity stands by him.
2.195.10	Then (verse) addressed to Vāravantiya. Animals are Vāravantiyas.
2.195.11	For the securing of animals.
2.195.12	Then (verses) addressed to Sabha.
2.195.13	Sabha is the un-divided, the shining one.
2.195.14	Then (Sabha) is the shining one, the eater of food.
2.195.15	Now this is the famous Srughya Saman.
2.195.16	"The fame of him who rises up, rises up after him."
2.195.17	"O Purujit, you are the lord of the sacrifice." The Anushtubh verses have the word "sacrifice" in them.
2.195.18	Food is sacrifice.
2.195.19	They thus bless him with food, while he is still asleep.
2.195.20	In these (verses) there is no praise.
2.195.21	For even here the Sodashi (verse) is performed.
2.195.22	Then the Vishovishiyam (hymn) is sung. The Ksatra-sâman is sung. One who is consecrated with the Ksatra (hymn) should be consecrated with the Ksatriya (hymn).
2.195.23	Then the Susvâna (hymn) of the Vis.
2.195.24	The king is the Vis.
2.195.25	Then the Shyavasvam (hymn) which is heavenly. For the attainment of the heavenly world.
2.195.26	Then the Andhigavam (hymn). Food is Andhigavam. For the attainment (of food).
2.195.27	Then (the verse) "Who is the poet, who is the one who sleeps?"
2.195.28	Then (the verse) "Who is the poet? Who is the one who is asleep?"
2.195.29	Then the Yajñayajñiya, the Agnistoma Sāman, is known.
2.195.30	The Agnistoma Sãman is known, lest we should transgress.
2.195.31	Then (the verses) for seniority.
2.195.32	The Yajñayajnīya is indeed for seniority.
2.195.33	He thus establishes him in seniority.
2.195.34	Then the Sākma-asva-svarga, the Sama for attaining the Svarga world.
2.195.35	Then the Sauvira, the Brihat's splendour.
2.195.36	It is said, "We have been praised by the Brihat with splendour."
2.195.37	Then the Narmedha, the Atiratra Sama. The Atiratra Sama is not to be interrupted.
2.195.38	Narmedha is indeed cattle. It is for the securing of cattle.
2.195.39	Then the Sodasi (hymn). The desire that is in the Sodasi, that has been obtained by me.
2.195.40	Then there is the Bṛhat in the Śipivistavati (hymn).
2.195.41	Mind indeed is Bṛhat.
2.195.42	Mind is Prajapati.
2.195.43	This is the seventeenth hymn.
2.195.44	This is a seventeen-fold Stoma.
2.195.45	Prajapati is seventeen-fold.
2.195.46	Prajapatı is heaven.
2.195.47	That is prosperity.
2.195.48	They establish him in the heaven of the lord of creatures, in the world of heaven, at the very least.
2.196.1	Now this is the Rajasuya.
2.196.2	Varuna desired to be king of all the gods.
2.196.3	He saw this sacrifice.
2.196.4	He brought it.
2.196.5	He performed it.
2.196.6	Then he became king of all the deities.
2.196.7	He who knows this becomes the best of his own people.
2.196.8	And there are thirty-four Pavamana verses.
2.196.9	The world of the gods is indeed the kingdom of the self.
2.196.10	And the thirty-four verses are the kingdom of the Self.
2.196.11	They thus honour him, while he is singing, with the kingdom of the world in the Pavamana verses,
2.196.12	The Anushtubh verse is the first verse.
2.196.13	Speech is indeed the Anushtubh.
2.196.14	Speech is the kingdom.
2.196.15	When consecrated with the Kshatra, he is consecrated as the Kshatra.
2.196.16	Then these five wives belong to different deities.
2.196.17	When a man is consecrated for the kingdom of five, he is consecrated for the king, the Kshatriya, the Sūta, the Grāmaṇī, the Śūdra, and the Dāsa.
2.196.18	From here they carry the Trivrit Stoma and the Agniya Samvarta to the wives of the priests.
2.196.19	From here the Brahmana is superior to the Rajanya, the Amarya is superior to the Adandya, the Aghatya is superior to them.
2.196.20	If they were to perform the Trivrit stoma here and the Agniya samvarta for the wives of the Brahmanas, then the Rajanya would conquer the Brahmanas and would kill them without being killed.
2.197.1	They say, a noble should not know this.
2.197.2	As the merchant wishes, so he does.
2.197.3	If one were to say, "Perform the Trivrit Stoma and the Agnieya Sambharya," then the noble would conquer the Brahmanas, and would kill them without a wound.
2.197.4	They say, he who knows this, should be defeated by one who is not a Brahmin.
2.197.5	He should be killed for not knowing the truth.
2.197.6	They say, those who go to the three-fold Stoma go away from the vital breaths.
2.197.7	One should perform the Agniṣṭoma with the three-fold stoma in front.
2.197.8	The three-fold is the vital breath.
2.197.9	They do not go away from the vital airs by that alone.
2.197.10	Brahma is born in front, the Kshatra is born.
2.197.11	Some say that it is the Apaciti sacrifice.
2.197.12	One should perform it by that alone. It is said.
2.197.13	By that alone they do not go away.
2.197.14	Apaciti is enjoyed by the one who is awake.
2.197.15	They say that this is the Vayu-step. Vayu is the breath. By the breath they prosper.
2.197.16	"He goes to the bright Vayu." It becomes bright.
2.197.17	"He shines like a light among other men, he who shines, like a light."
2.197.18	"May the sweet be the foremost in the divine gifts." Thus they make the sweet the foremost.
2.197.19	"Come to the Soma-drinking." This is for Soma.
2.197.20	It is performed with the Pavamana hymn.
2.197.21	"O Sparha, O God, for the Nighyutvatis."
2.197.22	Sparha is the nobility.
2.197.23	The Nighyutvati are the common people.
2.197.24	They make the common people follow the nobility.
2.197.25	Therefore the Kshatra is the follower of the Vid.
2.198.1	Now these are of Sarasvat and Sarasvati.
2.198.2	This is indeed the divine pair, the begetting, that is Sarasvat and Saraswati.
2.198.3	By the divine pair, for the begetting of offspring.
2.198.4	They say: The man's should be done first, the woman's afterwards.
2.198.5	So it is said: "The prince was born to Susvan, not stammering."
2.198.6	They say that Vayu is the holder of semen.
2.198.7	Sarasvati is the generator.
2.198.8	They generate Sarasvata from the union of the two.
2.198.9	It is said that the cow goes first, and the bull follows. It is said that Sarasvati should go first.
2.198.10	This is indeed so. Sarasvati should go before.
2.198.11	Then the Brahmanical and Kshatriya (cows) should be let loose. The Kshatriya should go before the Brahmanical (cow).
2.198.12	Then Savitri, born from Savitar, should be sung.
2.198.13	Then these two verses are used as the introductory verses.
2.198.14	For both the Sāmans are used here.
2.198.15	The verse "Obeisance to the nine-fold" is used for the consecration.
2.198.16	And they proceed with the Trivrt Stoma.
2.198.17	It consists of six verses.
2.198.18	They are sung by those who speak the Sāman.
2.198.19	It becomes like a bull.
2.198.20	"This bull is being consecrated, may he be consecrated."
2.198.21	It consists of four verses for the securing of the four-footed animals.
2.198.22	The verses are in the Dvipadi metre for the securing of two-footed animals. The verses are in the Pañcadaśa-pada metre for the securing
2.198.23	of five-footed animals. It is a Parāsa verse, the desire for Parāsa is obtained by him.
2.199.1	The last verse is in Anushtubh metre.
2.199.2	The Udgātṛ priest should perform the Rājasūya sacrifice for the king, so that he may ascend the assembly of the gods in the Bahispavamāna (Sāman).
2.199.3	The first verse is in Anustubh metre and the last verse is also in Anushtubha metre.
2.199.4	There are sixty-four syllables in these two verses.
2.199.5	The assembly of the gods is sixty.
2.199.6-10	Now those four are the legs of the couch. This is the king, the Udgātṛ raises the couch of the gods on the Bahispavamāna. There are two kinds of oblations. For both the Sāmans are performed here. They say that the offerings should be made with the Barhītas.
2.199.11	Or the vessels of the Vidyadharas, or of the Vidyas, or of Vidyadharis, or of the Kshatra, or of the Suyas.
2.199.12	They say, however, that both kinds of vessels should be used.
2.199.13	For all the kingdoms he is consecrated.
2.199.14	Therefore both kinds of vessels are used.
2.199.15	They are fifteen in number.
2.199.16	The Kshatra is fifteenfold.
2.199.17	When consecrated with the Ksatra (royal) consecration, he is consecrated.
2.200.1	When the sun rises after the Avabhṛtha (rite), one releases the garland of twelve lotus flowers.
2.200.2	The waters were the wives of the gods.
2.200.3	They desired union.
2.200.4	The gods approached them.
2.200.5	They placed the embryo in them.
2.200.6	From that, the lotus flowers were born.
2.200.7	The waters are indeed truth.
2.200.8	Truth is indeed consecration.
2.200.9	That is indeed the truth, namely, the twelve Pushkaras.
2.200.10	He releases the truth for him, namely, the truth, for the Tapas and consecration.
2.200.11	It becomes twelve Pushkaras (in number).
2.200.12	Twelve months are a year.
2.200.13	The year is a sacrifice.
2.200.14	He releases that sacrifice in him.
2.200.15	Some say, it should be only seven Pushkaras.
2.200.16	There are seven metres.
2.200.17	The sacrifice is extended by the metres.
2.200.18	He thus releases the sacrifice in him.
2.200.19	They say, it should be with six lotus-flowers.
2.200.20	There are six seasons in a year.
2.200.21	The year is the sacrifice.
2.200.22	He thus places the sacrifice in him.
2.200.23-31	Then they say, it should be with five Pushkaras. The sacrifice is fivefold. Animals are fivefold. The animals are the sacrifice. He releases the sacrifice in him. Then they say, it (the sacrifice) should be with four Pushkaras. The directions are four. Animals are four-footed. The animals constitute the sacrifice.
2.200.32-38	He thus releases the sacrifice upon him. Some say, it should be with three lotus-cups. The sacrifice is threefold. He thus releases the sacrifice on him. Some indeed say, it should have twelve lotus-cups. For twelve are all these. Therefore it should be with twelve lotus-cups.
2.201.1	Then these are the Iṣṭis which are performed in succession.
2.201.2	Indeed, the waters, with the sixteenfold hymn, struck down the lustre of Varuna Suswan.
2.201.3	It fell on this direction.
2.201.4	It became fourfold: Bhrigu was one part, Sarasvati was one part, Dashapeyya was one part, and Sraiyantiya was one part.
2.201.5	Therefore the Hotri of this sacrifice is Bhārgava. The Sarasvatī waters are to be used for consecration. The Dasapeya sacrifice is the Brahma-sāman.
2.201.6	Those gods said, "Let us obtain this Bhārgava."
2.201.7	They saw these Iṣṭis (sacrifices) in the form of a serpent.
2.201.8	With them they followed him.
2.201.9	What they crept along, that is the creeping, the creeping along.
2.201.10	They found it with the deity Vishnu by means of the ten (verses).
2.201.11	Therefore, the tenth oblation of this sacrifice is offered to Vishnu.
2.201.12	For they found it on the tenth (day).
2.201.13	One should creep along on the tenth (verse).
2.201.14	For they found (it) on the tenth (verses).
2.201.15	There are ten cups.
2.201.16	For they found it on the tenth day.
2.201.17	Ten cups are spread out in succession.
2.201.18	For they discovered it on the tenth.
2.201.19	He who is not separated from the Soma-drinking of ten men is the performer of the feast.
2.201.20	For they came to know it on the tenth (day).
2.201.21	They then surrounded it with fire.
2.201.22	The Maruts blew.
2.201.23	They made it flourish by the Sraayantiya (Sastra).
2.201.24	That is why the Sraayantiyas are called Sraayantiyas.
2.201.25	Of that Yajnayajniya, the Bahispavamana is performed.
2.201.26	Agni is the praise of the Yajnayajnya.
2.201.27	By Agni alone they make it flourish.
2.202.1	The Brahma-sastra is the Sraayanti.
2.202.2	They make it flourish by that.
2.202.3	They chant the Yajñāyajñiya in Anushtup verses.
2.202.4	The Yajñāayajñiya is speech.
2.202.5	The Anushtup is speech.
2.202.6	They thus make it complete by speech.
2.202.7	The Varavantiya is the Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
2.202.8	The Varavantīya is power and strength.
2.202.9	They thus complete it by power and strength.
2.202.10	It is seventeen-fold; Prajapati is seventeen-fold.
2.202.11	Prajapati is the knower of the lost; he who is the knower, by him we obtain this light.
2.202.12	The Agniṣṭoma is the sacrifice; this is indeed the year, for the Agniṣṭoma; by the year they indeed surrounded them and placed them in themselves.
2.202.13	In that (sacrifice) the Dakṣiṇās are given in this way: a garland to the Udgātṛ, gold to the Hotṛ, a pair of garments to the Adhvaryu, twelve milch-cows to the Brahman, a bull to the Maitrāvaruṇa, a garment to the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, a large quantity of barley to the Nestr, a bull to Acchāvāka, a goat to the Agnidh.
2.203.5	Now, when these (sacrifices) are performed in due order, it is by prosperity.
2.203.6	He who knows this prospers.
2.203.7	Now, some say that the two Prakasha (sacrifices) of the Adhvaryu are called by their forms.
2.203.8	And whatever they do with light, that is done with the same purpose.
2.203.9	Now, as to why there are twelve heifers for the Brahman, the heifers are procreation, and the Brahman is procreation; thus it is done in accordance with the similarity of their characteristics.
2.203.10	And as to why there is a milch cow for Mitra-Varuna, the milch cow is milk, and Mitra-Varuna are the sharers of milk; thus it is performed in accordance with the likeness of their characteristics.
2.203.11	Now, the reason why the bull is given to the Brahman-priest is that the Brahman-priest belongs to Indra, and the bull belongs to Indra; thus it is done in accordance with their respective characteristics.
2.203.12	Now, the reason why garments are given to the Neshatapotar-priests is that the Neshatapotars belong to the Maruts, and the garments belong to the Marut; thus it is in accordance with their characteristics.
2.203.13	The Maruts are the earth, and the garment is made of threads.
2.203.14	Now, the barley-meal which is for the Acchavaka, is like a daughter, for the Acchavakya office is a worn-out office.
2.203.15	They make it grow with these very barley-grains.
2.203.16	It becomes thick, the form of prosperity.
2.203.17	The offices are concluded after the Acchavaka office.
2.203.18	Now, when the bull is given to the Agnidh, it is because the bull carries, and Agni carries the oblation to the gods. That is why this similarity is made.
2.203.19	And when these (gifts) are given in accordance with the prescribed form, it is for prosperity.
2.203.20	He who knows this prospers.
2.204.1	Rising from the Avabhṛtha, he shaves only the beard, not the hair.
2.204.2	Śrī is the head.
2.204.3	Indeed, Śrī goes to the head of one who is asleep.
2.204.4	If one were to shave one's hair before a year, one would be shaving Śrī and not the hair.
2.204.5	If one shaves one's hair after a year, one takes Śrī within oneself by means of the year and shaves the hair and not Śrī.
2.204.6	Therefore one should offer it only above.
2.204.7	It becomes an Atiratra (sacrifice).
2.204.8	This is the form of hair, namely, the Atiratra.
2.204.9	Those which are white are the form of the day, and those which are black are the form of night.
2.204.10	Therefore it becomes an Atiratrasacrifice.
2.204.11	These are its antithetical (verses).
2.204.12	Then he ascends to the better one, he who is being consecrated.
2.204.13	His Ekavimsa (twenty-one-fold) Soma-pressing is performed in the morning.
2.204.14	There are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun, making twenty-one.
2.204.15	This indeed is Varuna.
2.204.16	He now ascends Varuna's Soma-pressing. He who ascends the superior one and does not then honour him, he leads him by that with which he desires him.
2.204.17	Now, since these Stotras are in the reverse order, they are indeed the means of removing the obstacles. The Stotras again come in the forward order.
2.204.18	He who, having ascended the superior (heaven), then says to him, "Go away, do not go back," he says to him, that is, if the Aśvinī rites are performed again and rise upwards, as if one were to say, "Go away and do not go back." It is like that.
2.204.19	His Rathantara is at midday.
2.204.20	This (earth) is the Rathantara.
2.204.21	In this very (sacrifice) he finds support.
2.205.1	Now this is the two-day (sacrifice).
2.205.2	One who desires offspring should offer it.
2.205.3	In it both kinds of stomas are used, odd and even.
2.205.4	This is the divine pair, the begetting (of offspring), that both kinds of stoma are used.
2.205.5	"He thinks, 'May that divine pair, the procreation, procreate me."
2.205.6	His two Sāmans are Bṛhat and Rathantara.
2.205.7	This is the divine pair, the begetting, that is Bṛhat and Rathaṃtara.
2.205.8	So that the divine pair, begetting, may beget me.
2.205.9	His Brahman-sāman is Pañcaviṃśa.
2.205.10	Man is Pañcavimśa.
2.205.11	This is a desire of the sacrificer, that is the Brahman-sāma.
2.205.12	He thus makes the subjects attain the state of a man.
2.205.13	For him there are seven hundred and twenty Stotriya verses.
2.205.14	There are so many days and nights in a year.
2.205.15	The days and nights indeed generate everything here.
2.205.16	"Those who generate everything here, may they generate me."
2.206.1	Now this is the Triṣṭoma Agniṣṭoma.
2.206.2	One who desires to be established should offer this.
2.206.3	They say, "He who is sacrificed is indeed expelled from this world."
2.206.4	When it becomes Trishtum, it means that there are three worlds, and he is established in those worlds.
2.206.5	And this is indeed the sacrifice called Dhriti.
2.206.6	Its Prstha is Rathantara.
2.206.7	Then the king Abhipratarana was defeated by him.
2.206.8	He made it for two nights.
2.206.9	Then a brahmana said to him, "The Kurus will conquer Kurukshetra."
2.206.10	"Take only the subjects, not the fields."
2.206.11	The Kurus, having conquered Kurukshetra, are wandering. These are the Kurus in Kurukshetra.
2.206.12	Now this (Soma) is indeed taken away from the fields, because it is the Triṣṭu and Agnistūma.
2.207.1	Now these are the Nakṣat-sadas.
2.207.2	The gods indeed ascended to heaven.
2.207.3	Having gone to heaven, they were together without any distinction.
2.207.4	They desired: "We should be distinguished in heaven, in the world of heaven."
2.207.5	They saw these Nakṣat-sadā-s
2.207.6	They brought them.
2.207.7	They worshipped with them.
2.207.8	Then they dwelt in the world of heaven in the sky.
2.207.9	Because they dwelt in the heaven in the sky, it is called the world of heaven.
2.207.10	He who knows thus dwells in the heaven in sky, says Janashruti.
2.207.11	Then indeed Vaitehavya said, "In this very world, Prajapati created the gods."
2.207.12	Then indeed the upper worlds were cut off. The forests were indeed there, but they were not accessible by chariots. They were like the forest-fringes, but they were inaccessible.
2.207.13	The gods desired, "We should go to heaven."
2.208.1	The Vasus went first.
2.208.2	They established this world with three three-fold (sacrifices), and settled in one fifteen-fold (sacrifice).
2.208.3	They established the world of the atmosphere with three three-folds.
2.208.4	They settled in one seventeen-fold.
2.208.5	They established the other world with three three folds.
2.208.6	He (the sacrificer) is connected with the Ekavimsa (Stoma).
2.208.7	Just as a sharp axe, just as fire is the deity of the gods, so is this Trivrt Stoma.
2.208.8	Just as one would cut down in front with an axe and make it even with fire from behind, in the same way the Vasus made these worlds with the Trivrt Stotra.
2.208.9	Because he went to these worlds, therefore these Stotras are called Prayuta.
2.208.10	Just as one who is burnt by fire and then goes to a good place, so the Vasus went.
2.208.11	Therefore they are the gods of the other half.
2.208.12	For they went first.
2.209.1	Then the Rudras saw a path that was more difficult to traverse.
2.209.2	They established this world with one (verse) consisting of three (feet).
2.209.3	They settled down with three (verses) consisting of fifteen (feet).
2.209.4	With one (verse) alone consisting of three (they) established this world of the sky.
2.209.5	They settled down (there) with three (verses), consisting of seventeen (feet).
2.209.6	(They) established that world with one (alone) consisting of three.
2.209.7	They settled (there) with (three verses) consisting of twenty-one (feet).
2.209.8	Just as the path of the Kṛta age was uneven,
2.209.9	so they made it even afterwards. Thus the Rudras went.
2.209.10	Then the Ādityas went by the path of the four three-fold, four fifteen-fold, three seventeen-fold, and one twenty-one-fold (verses).
2.209.11-15	Then the Angirases went with three sets of three, five, seven, nine, eleven, thirteen, fifteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one, twenty-three, twenty-five, twenty-seven, twenty-nine, thirty-one, thirty-three, thirty-five, thirty-seven, thirty-nine, forty-one, forty-three, forty-five, forty-seven, forty-nine, fifty-one, fifty-three, fifty-five, fifty-seven, fifty-nine, sixty-one, sixty-three, sixty-five, sixty-seven, sixty-nine, seventy-one, seventy-three, seventy-five, seventy-seven, seventy-nine, eighty-one, eighty-three, eighty-five, eighty-seven, eighty-nine, ninety-one, ninety-three, ninety-five, ninety-seven, ninety-nine, one hundred and one, one hundred and three, one hundred and five, one hundred and seven, one hundred and nine, one hundred and eleven, one hundred and thirteen, one hundred and fifteen, one hundred and seventeen, one hundred and nineteen, one hundred and twenty-one, one hundred and twent-three, one hundred and tenty-five, one hundred and seventy-seven, one hundred and ninety-nine, two hundred and one, two hundred and three, two hundred and five, two hundred and seven, two hundred and nine, two hundred and eleven, two hundred and thirteen, two hundred and fifteen, two hundred and seventeen, two hundred and nineteen, two hundred and twenty-nine, two hunderd and thirty-one, two hundred and thirty-three, two hundred and ninety-five, two hundred and ninty-seven, two hundred and nin-ty-nine,
2.209.16	The thirty-three gods alone went to the world of heaven.
2.209.17	Having gone to the world of Svarga, they remained together without any disagreement.
2.209.18	They desired, "We too should be in the world of heaven in the sky."
2.210.1	They saw this Stoma of thirty-three gods.
2.210.2	They brought it.
2.210.3	They say, "Which are the thirty-three gods?"
2.210.4	These five deities are indeed the All-gods. One should say that they become the All-gods indeed.
2.210.5	Those All-gods, with this Stoma of thirty-three, attained the time.
2.210.6	Those thirty-three indeed are the deities, the thirty-three worlds of the gods.
2.210.7	From there they settled in the heavenly world.
2.210.8-11	They said, "We do not exist in the heavenly world, in the sky." What they said, "We don't exist in the heavenly realm, in the sky," that is the existence and essence of those who exist in the sky. Indeed, one who knows this does not perish in the heavenly world in the sky. Here, both are the same for them, for one goes there by both, wherever one wishes to go.
2.211.3	They saw these sacrifices.
2.211.4	They brought them.
2.211.5	They sacrificed with them.
2.211.6	Vasishtha first sacrificed.
2.211.7	He sacrificed with this.
2.211.8	He attained this prosperity, obtained this food, this renewal, which is that of spring.
2.211.9	Then Śiśira thought, "By the very same means by which these former ones performed the sacrifice and attained prosperity, I shall perform the sacrifice."
2.211.10	He performed the sacrifice by the very same means.
2.211.11	He attained the very same prosperity, obtained this food, and attained this renewal, which is Śiśira's.
2.212.1	This is indeed the most prosperous of them all.
2.212.2	For this is the form of a cow, a horse, and a man.
2.212.3	This is the endless wheel of the gods, inexhaustible, new again and again, it turns both hither and thither.
2.212.4	He who knows this thus conquers this endlessness, this inexhaustibility, this newness again and again.
2.212.5	He who desires, 'May I attain the same sacrifice, the same prosperity, may I obtain food and may I be renewed again and again', should offer these sacrifices.
2.212.6	He should offer the first one in spring.
2.212.7	He attains that prosperity, obtains that food and that renewal, which is this spring.
2.212.8	One should sacrifice with the second (verse) in summer.
2.212.9	One should sacrifice with the third (verse) in the rainy season.
2.212.10	One should offer with the fourth (verse) in autumn.
2.212.11	One should make an offering with the fifth (verse) in winter.
2.212.12	One should perform with the sixth (verse) in spring.
2.212.13	He indeed attains that prosperity, obtains that food, and that renewal, which is this spring.
2.213.1	He becomes one with the seasons.
2.213.2	He thus approaches the seasons and attains the imperishable, the well-done, which is not interrupted.
2.213.3	He comes back again and again, growing by the well-done.
2.213.4	These are the five hymns.
2.213.5	The sacrifice is fivefold, the animals are fivefold, the food is fivefold, and the seasons are fivefold. Whatever there is that is fivefold, this is the prosperity of all that, and the attainment of it.
2.213.6	Of them, each one has sixty Stotriya verses.
2.213.7	There are as many days as there are seasons.
2.213.8	They do not exceed the seasons.
2.213.9	All of them have three hundred and sixty Stotriya verses.
2.213.10	There are as many nights in a year.
2.213.11	They attain that year through the nights.
2.213.12	They say, "One should approach the Prstha (verses) only."
2.213.13	One should approach the next Prstha from the previous one.
2.213.14	Because the Prsthas are the seasons.
2.213.15	The Rathantara-sāman should be the first, then the Bṛhat-sāman, then the Vairāja-sāman and then the Śakvari-sāman. The Revati-sāman would be the last.
2.213.16	They say that the Prstha-sāmans should be separated from the Diksā and Upasad days.
2.213.17	If they do so, the Prstha sāmans are performed far away.
2.213.18	The Prstha indeed is worthy of being borne by the Prstha.
2.213.19	This is the offspring of the Brihat and Rathantara, namely these Sama-s.
2.213.20	The Brihat and Rathantara are the continuity of the interrupted sacrifice.
2.213.21	Therefore they should be the Brihat and the Rathantara.
2.213.22	The first one should be the Rathantara-sāman, then the Bṛhat-sāman; then the Rathantara-săman, then the Brhat-sāmaṇ; then the Rathantara-sāman and the Brhat-săman should be the last.
2.213.23	Among them, the Sama-s which are the receptacles of the seasons, they arrange them in such a way that they become the means of attaining heaven, for the prosperity of the heavenly world and for the prosperity of those having the form of the day.
2.214.1	Now these are the Stotras of the directions.
2.214.2	The directions desired: "May we attain the same sacrifice, the same prosperity, may we attain stability, may we conquer the endless heavenly world."
2.214.3	They saw these sacrifices.
2.214.4	They brought them.
2.214.5	They sacrificed with them.
2.214.6	This eastern direction sacrificed first.
2.214.7	He sacrificed with this.
2.214.8	He won this very prosperity, this very establishment, this endless heavenly world.
2.214.9	This is the endless heavenly world that he has won.
2.214.10	He who goes east for many days would not find its end.
2.214.11	Then this (region) of the zenith thought: 'By the same means by which these (regions) of the east have worshipped, I shall also worship.'
2.214.12	She worshipped by the same means.
2.214.13	She attained the same prosperity, the same stability, the same endless heavenly world.
2.214.14	This is the endless heavenly world conquered by her.
2.214.15	Now, indeed, he who would go beyond many days would not find the end of this.
2.215.1	They say, "One should approach the (sacrifices) in the order of the (sacrifices of) the Prstha."
2.215.2	One should approach the Prsthas in the order of Prsthas.
2.215.3	For the Prsthas are the directions.
2.215.4	The Rathantara-sāman should be the first, then the Bṛhat-sāman, then the Vairāja-sāman and then the Śakvari-sāman. The Revati-sāman would be the last.
2.215.5	They say that the Prstha-sāmans should be separated from the Diksā and Upasad days.
2.215.6	If they do so, the Prstha sāmans are performed far away.
2.215.7	The Prstha indeed is worthy of being borne by the Prstha.
2.215.8	This is the offspring of the Brihat and Rathantara, namely these Sama-s.
2.215.9	The Brihat and Rathantara are the continuity of the interrupted sacrifice.
2.215.10	Therefore they should be the Brihat and the Rathantara.
2.215.11	It should be Rāthantera-sāman first, then Bṛhat-sāman, then Rāthantera, then Bṛha, then Rāthantara and Bṛhat together. This is the last one.
2.216.1	They are five sets of twenty.
2.216.2	The twenty which are Viraṭ are this.
2.216.3	The four which are left are these four directions.
2.216.4	Now the one which is the fifth of the twenty-five is the upward direction.
2.216.5	The directions indeed milked the heaven, the heaven milked the directions.
2.216.6	He who knows thus obtains the milking of the directions and the heaven.
2.216.7	He who desires to attain the same prosperity as the gods, to attain the same success, to attain the highest heaven, should offer these sacrifices.
2.216.8	He should offer a great sacrifice to the gods.
2.216.9	He should build five halls and say: "One here, one here, one here and one here, and one in the middle."
2.216.10	He should offer sacrifice with this Rathantara-saman.
2.216.11	He attains this very prosperity, this very foundation, this endless heavenly world.
2.216.12	Then he should offer sacrifice with the Brihat-saman, then with the Rathantara-soman, then with the Brihat, then with both.
2.216.13	He wins this very prosperity, this very foundation, this very endless heavenly world, and goes to this very direction.
2.216.14	He becomes the only one among the directions, and goes to the directions.
2.216.15	This endless heavenly world is won by him.
2.216.16	Those who are in the directions, those who are in the ends of the directions, those in the ends of space, they arrange the hymns, those which are fit for heaven, for the attainment of heaven, for the prosperity of the day-like forms.
2.217.1	Now these are the Rishis' Stotras.
2.217.2	The sages indeed conquered the heavenly world by exertion, austerity, and observance of vows.
2.217.3	They desired, having created offspring in this world, to go to the heavenly world.
2.217.4	Vasishtha desired, "May my offspring be foremost and chief."
2.217.5	He saw this three-fold Stoma.
2.217.6	He brought it.
2.217.7	He performed the sacrifice with it.
2.217.8	The three-fold Stomas are indeed foremost and chief.
2.217.9	From that time his offspring became foremost and chief.
2.217.10	And these are now the best and foremost of the Kurus.
2.217.11	He who knows thus becomes the best and foremost.
2.217.12	Then Bharadvaja desired, 'May my offspring be the most vigorous and strongest.'
2.217.13	He saw this fifteen-fold Stoma.
2.217.14	He brought it.
2.217.15	He performed the sacrifice with it.
2.217.16	Strength is the power of the fifteen Stoma.
2.217.17	From that his progeny became the strongest and most powerful.
2.217.18	Even now the Kurus do not go by the path by which the Bharadvajas went.
2.217.19	And they cry out, "The strength of the Bharadvaja!"
2.217.20	Therefore only the Bharadvajan is permitted to strike the offender in the assembly.
2.217.21	He who knows this becomes the most vigorous and strongest.
2.218.1	Then Jamadagni desired, 'May I go to the earth with offspring and cattle.'
2.218.2	He saw this seventeen-fold Stoma.
2.218.3	He brought it.
2.218.4	He performed the sacrifice with it.
2.218.5	The seventeen-fold Stomas are indeed the earth, the creator.
2.218.6	From there he went to the earth with progeny and cattle.
2.218.7	He who knows this goes to the world with offspring and cattle.
2.218.8	Then Gautamī desired, "May my offspring be worthy of faith and have brahmic lustre."
2.218.9	He saw this twenty-one-fold Stoma.
2.218.10	He brought it.
2.218.11	He performed the sacrifice with it.
2.218.12	Faith is brahmic lustre among the twenty-one Stomas.
2.218.13	For that is the sun.
2.219.2	He brought it.
2.219.3	He performed a sacrifice with it.
2.219.4	The Tri-nav-stoma is indeed the brilliance of the Stotras.
2.219.5	From that time onwards, more sages were born in his progeny, and even his women were born as sages.
2.219.6	Therefore, even if one kills a woman of the Atri clan, one is looked upon as a sinner.
2.219.7	He who knows this becomes radiant.
2.219.8	Then Visvamitra desired, "May my subjects go to the kingdom."
2.219.9	He saw this thirty-three-fold Stoma.
2.219.10	He brought it.
2.219.11	He performed the sacrifice with it.
2.219.12	The thirty-three is the kingdom among the Stomas.
2.219.13	From that his subjects went to the kingdom.
2.219.14	Asta was consecrated in his lineage.
2.220.2	He desired, 'May I also, having created offspring in this world, go to the heavenly world.'
2.220.3	He saw this sixteen-fold Stoma.
2.220.4	He brought it.
2.220.5	He performed the sacrifice with it.
2.220.6	The heavenly world is the sixteen Stomas.
2.220.7	From there he went to the heavenly world, having created offspring.
2.220.8	Having thus established the progeny in this world, he goes to the heavenly world. He who knows thus.
2.220.9	Therefore, when Agastya approaches the Brahmanas, he becomes like a follower.
2.220.10	For the sixteenth (stoma) is indeed like a follower of the Stomas.
2.220.11	Therefore, Agastya is outside the Kurus and Pancalas.
2.220.12	For indeed, the sixteenth (Stoma) is outside the Stomas.
2.221.1	Now these are the Vratya Stomas.
2.221.2	The heavenly Vratyas ran to the Vratya (Stoma) with Budha as their architect.
2.221.3	They reached these Vratyas, this one who blows here, or the god Isana.
2.221.4	They were excluded from the sacrifice.
2.221.5	They did not know the heavenly world.
2.221.6	They desired, 'May we know the heaven world.'
2.221.7	They approached Prajapati himself.
2.221.8	He created for them this Vratyasstoma sacrifice.
2.221.9	They brought it.
2.221.10	They performed it.
2.221.11	Then they did know the heaven world.
2.221.12	Those who perform the Vratya rite are indeed confused.
2.221.13	Now, when they perform the Vratya Stoma, it is for the sake of the fame of the heavenly world.
2.221.14	There are thirty-two Pavamāna verses in it.
2.221.15	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
2.221.16	Anushtubh is speech.
2.221.17	Those who run the Vratya sacrifice, they are deprived of speech.
2.221.18	When there are thirty-two pavamāna verses, then they are enriched by speech.
2.221.19	The Anushtubh verse is the first verse.
2.221.20	The Anushtubh is speech.
2.221.21	Those who run in the Vratya rite are deprived of speech.
2.222.1	For they speak impure, unclean things with speech.
2.222.2	Their power and strength depart from speech.
2.222.3	Therefore, when the Anushtubh becomes the first verse, they prosper with speech in an orderly manner.
2.223.2	Agni is the one who designates the worlds.
2.223.3	He who designates the worlds, may he designate the worlds for us.
2.223.4	For you, O Agni, do not know the cruel body of mortals. Whatever cruel and unsettled deed we have done here, we destroy it with this (verse).
2.223.5	The monkey holds the fire-stick, the womb again, like a cow. They again go with this (verse),
2.223.6	"Agni with all the fires" - this is the offering of ghee to all the fires.
2.223.7	The All-gods are indeed the fires.
2.223.8	By this they attain all the gods.
2.223.9	It becomes Anushtubh, saying "We prosper with speech at the beginning of each pressing."
2.223.10	It becomes Trivrit, for the Brahman is Trivrit.
2.223.11	Those who make the Vratya run, run away from Brahman.
2.223.12	They are called "sons of kings".
2.223.13	When it is three-fold, they prosper through Brahman.
2.223.14	The fifteen-fold is for the Maitrāvaruṇa.
2.223.15	The fifteen is the Kshatra.
2.223.16	The Kshatra is the decline of Brahman.
2.223.17	They prosper by the Kshatra.
2.223.18	The seventeen belongs to the Brahmana-cchamsin.
2.223.19	Prajapati is seventeen.
2.223.20	They prosper by Prajapati.
2.223.21	The sixteen belongs to the Acchhavacaka.
2.223.22	The sixteen is the strength and energy.
2.223.23	They prosper through that strength and energy.
2.224.1	Then they take up the Uṣṇīṣa and Kakubha (verses) for the midday pressing.
2.224.2	The Uṣṇīsa and Kakubha verses are the offspring of the metres.
2.224.3	There are two Sāmans of the Bṛhat and Māruta (verses).
2.224.4	They are the divine Sāmans.
2.224.5	The metres are the heavenly world.
2.224.6	Just as one would beg for a beloved son or a friend would beg for a friend, so do all the metres, beginning with the middle, come to an end.
2.224.7	Of these two, the Brahma-sāman is in the other.
2.224.8	Brahma is the Brahma-saman.
2.224.9	This Brahma-saman is indeed the desire of the sacrificer.
2.224.10	They satisfy the sacrificer with his desires in his own abode.
2.224.11	The Hotr's verse is seventeen syllables long.
2.224.12	Prajapati is seventeen.
2.224.13	They thus make him (Prajapati) middle-sized.
2.224.14	The Maitravaruna's verse is twenty-one syllables long.
2.224.15	Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun are twenty-one.
2.224.16	They thus middle-size him.
2.224.17	The Brahmanachchasa's verse is thirty-three syllables long.
2.224.18-25	These are the nine worlds. They thus make the worlds in the middle. The sixteenth is for the Acchāvāka. The sixteenth (verse) is power and strength. They prosper by that power and strength. The sixteenth is for the Adhvaryu. That makes thirty-two. The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
2.224.26	The desire that is in the Anushtubh metre is not obtained, it is not there.
2.225.1	Then these are performed in the Arbhava Pavamana, in the form of Usnih verses, which are called 'flowing like a river'.
2.225.2	They have seven syllables in each foot.
2.225.3	There are seven vital airs.
2.225.4	They proceed prospering through the vital airs.
2.225.5	Vital airs they attain, vital airs they stand in.
2.225.6	For they do harm to the Brahman who is not to be harmed, to the student or to the householder.
2.225.7	And because they have seven syllables, they prosper through the vital airs.
2.225.8	And they have four feet for stability.
2.225.9	They say that the four-footed one stands firm.
2.225.10	The firm standing is the Abode.
2.225.11	The Abode is speech.
2.225.12	Those who make the Vratya run, their words are frustrated.
2.225.13	When it is reversed, their words are fulfilled.
2.225.14	"The Agniṣṭoma Sāman is "O Agni, come with the fires."
2.225.15	All the gods are Agni.
2.225.16	By that they attain all the gods.
2.225.17	That becomes the Trayastrimsa.
2.225.18	The thirty-three are all the deities.
2.225.19	In all these deities the sacrifice is finally established.
2.226.1	They become the Keśinī (verses).
2.226.2	We invoke Agni, the bestower of strength, the bestower, the one with hair of ghee, the ancient at sacrifices. For they move like hair.
2.226.3	Now this is the sixteen Pavamānas of the Kusītaghas.
2.226.4	The sixteen is the power of Indra.
2.226.5	They prosper with the power of Indra and with prosperity.
2.226.6	There are three fifteen-fold oblations.
2.226.7	The fifteen is the nobility.
2.226.8	They prosper by means of the nobility.
2.226.9	The sixteen belongs to the Acchāvāka.
2.226.10	The sixteen-fold (verse) is the power of the senses.
2.226.11	They prosper with the power of the sense itself.
2.226.12	The midday (verse) is sixteen.
2.226.13	That makes thirty-two.
2.226.14	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
2.226.15	The desire that is Anushtubh is not obtained.
2.226.16	There are three sets of seventeen verses.
2.226.17	Prajapati is seventeen.
2.226.18	They prosper through Prajapati.
2.226.19	The Sodashin is for the Acchhavasa.
2.226.20	The Sodashi is the strength and energy.
2.226.21	They prosper through strength and energy. The Sodashin is the Sodashin.
2.226.22	The Sodasin is for the Arbhava.
2.226.23	That makes thirty-two.
2.226.24	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
2.226.25	The desire for the Anushtubh is not obtained.
2.226.26	The Agniṣṭoma Sāman is the twenty-first.
2.226.27	There are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun, making twenty-one.
2.226.28	They go to the same world as this, they ascend to this.
2.227.1	Now this is for those who desire the foremost of the youngest.
2.227.2	Its Bahispavamāna is the twenty-fourth of the Trivṛt.
2.227.3	Those who are the youngest and desire the foremost should offer this sacrifice.
2.227.4	Now, the Bahispavamāna is twenty-four in number, because the year consists of twenty-four half-months.
2.227.5	The year is the foremost, the most excellent. He who is the foremost, may he lead us to the foremost, the excellent.
2.227.6	It is of three stomas.
2.227.7	The three-stoma is the foremost and most excellent of the stomas.
2.227.8	He thinks, 'May it lead us to the foremost and most excelent position.'
2.227.9	It is in the Gāyatrī verses.
2.227.10	The Gāyatrī is the foremost and best of the metres.
2.227.11	He thinks 'May it lead me to the foremost and best position.'
2.227.12	Its Rathantara is the Prastaara.
2.227.13	Rathantara is the foremost of the Prastaaras, the most excellent.
2.227.14	It is the foremost, the most excellent, may it lead us to the foremost, the excellent.
2.227.15	It has twelve Stotras.
2.227.16	Twelve months are a year.
2.227.17	The year is the foremost, most excellent.
2.227.18	May he who is the foremost and most excellent, lead us to the foremost and most excelent.
2.227.19	There are twenty-four hymns of praise for him.
2.227.20	The year has twenty-four half-months.
2.227.21	The year is the foremost and the most excellent.
2.227.22	May he who is the most excellent and foremost, lead us to that which is the most excellent. 
2.227.23	The inferior ones go to the position of the superior.
2.228.1	Now these are the four monthly rites.
2.228.2	Prajapati created beings.
2.228.3	Those created by him became lost.
2.228.4	That became the creeping thing, except for the serpents.
2.228.5	He created the second.
2.228.6	Those became lost to him.
2.228.7	Those became fish.
2.228.8	He created a third.
2.228.9	They became his own.
2.228.10	They became the birds.
2.228.11	He thought, "Those three kinds of beings that I created, they have become separate from Brahman, from food, from sacrifice."
2.228.12	"Let me create beings from Brahman, from the food, from the sacrifice."
2.228.13	He placed food in himself.
2.228.14	That which he milked, that became the two breasts.
2.228.15	That which he milked before, that became the breasts.
2.228.16	Those two became the breasts. That which he milched, that became the nature of the breasts.
2.228.17	That flowed out.
2.228.18	That became the milk.
2.228.19	That which flowed out, that became the milk. That which he poured out, that became
2.228.20	the nature of the milk.
2.228.21	Indeed, that is what he placed in himself.
2.228.22	That is the milk of the barley and the grain.
2.228.23	He thought, "It is enough for me to create from this. I will obtain food by creating. Let me create."
2.229.1	He saw these sacrifices of the four months.
2.229.2	He brought them.
2.229.3	He performed them.
2.229.4	He created these beings by them.
2.229.5	Those who had udders, he gave food to them.
2.229.6	They became his food-giving beings.
2.229.7	He who desires, 'May I beget many offspring and cattle, and may my offspring be many', should offer these oblations.
2.229.8	He indeed begets many offspring and cattle and his offspring become many.
2.229.9	This is said about it:
2.229.10	Three kinds of offspring went to the other world.
2.229.11	Others, having gone around the sun,
2.229.12	It stood in the great chariot of the Rishis.
2.229.13	Pavamana entered the green (grass).
2.229.14	Thus it is said.
2.229.15	What he says, 'Three kinds of beings have gone to the other world', those beings who have gone to the yonder world, they are those (beings).
2.229.16	'Others have spread around the sun', the sun is Agni, these beings have spread around him.
2.229.17	Brihadh stood in the chariot of the Rishis, Pavamana entered the green (region).
2.229.18	The directions are green.
2.229.19	This wind, Pavamana, has entered them, says Vasasneyi.
2.229.20	Now the Ekadasakshi (eleven-eyed).
2.229.21	Three kinds of creatures have gone to the other world.
2.229.22	Those very creatures which have gone to the yonder world, they are these.
2.229.23	The others have spread around the sun. The sun is food, and these creatures have spread around it.
2.229.24	The great one stood in the sky of the firmament.
2.229.25	The mind is great.
2.229.26	It is this that stands in the sky of space in the middle of the self, the heart.
2.229.27	Pavamana has entered the green.
2.229.28	The green is the creatures.
2.229.29	This breath has entered them.
2.230.1	He desired, 'May I create the offspring of all the gods.'
2.230.2	He saw this sacrifice to all the gods.
2.230.3	He brought it.
2.230.4	He performed it.
2.230.5	With it he created the offspring of all gods.
2.230.6	He who desires, 'May I produce offspring of all the Gods,' should perform this sacrifice.
2.230.7	He produces offspring of all the deities.
2.230.8	It is three-fold, with Rathantara as the Sama.
2.230.9	Brahma is indeed the Trivṛt.
2.230.10	Brahma is the Rathantara.
2.230.11	Brahma created them with Brahma.
2.230.12	He who knows this creates offspring with Brahma.
2.230.13	Of it, the Agniya and the Barhaspatya are the animals.
2.230.14	Brahma indeed is Agni.
2.230.15	Brahma, indeed, is Brihaspati.
2.230.16	Brahma has created them in succession.
2.230.17	He who knows this, creates offspring with Brahma himself.
2.230.18	The Maitrāvaruṇa priest performs the Anūbandhya rite.
2.230.19	Mitra takes the well-performed part of the sacrifice, Varuna takes the ill-performed part.
2.230.20	Therefore, the Maitrāvaruṇa performs the Anūbanya rite. Mitra again gives it to him.
2.230.21	Varuna performs the well-performed for him.
2.230.22	It is the support of heaven and earth.
2.230.23	Heaven and earth were anxious, thinking, "What is this that is creating us? What is this that is supporting us?" Seeing (them) he said, "I am the creator. Let them bring their share to me."
2.230.24	They desired their share in him.
2.230.25	He created this support of heaven andearth for them.
2.230.26	Now, since these two (animals) are the supports of heaven and earth, he thereby appeases heaven and earth with this share.
2.230.27	The animal is dedicated to Agni; Agni is the sacrifice: 'Let me not be separated from the sacrifice and Agni,' thus (he thinks).
2.231.1	His creatures, when created, took the barley of Varuna.
2.231.2	Varuna seized them with the noose of Varuna.
2.231.3	He thought, "Those former creatures which I created have become distant.
2.231.4	If these (creatures) become distant, where will you be? You will be afflicted by them."
2.231.5	He saw these two Varuna-offerings lasting for two days.
2.231.6	He brought them.
2.231.7	He offered with them.
2.231.8	With them he freed himself from the sin of Varuna.
2.231.9	Now, when these two days are dedicated to Varuna, he thereby releases his subjects from the sin of Varuna.
2.231.10	The first day of the Maruts is the beginning.
2.231.11	The Agni and the Maruts are the animals.
2.231.12	His subjects, seized by Varuna, were released by the Maruts, who were looking for the holes.
2.231.13	Now, the Marutvatī is the first step; by this offering they have obtained their share in the Maruts.
2.231.14	The Agniya animal is Agni, the sacrifice; lest he should be deprived of the sacrifice and Agni.
2.231.15	The Kavati is the first step of the northern day; Ka is Prajapati; thus they gratify Prajapati at the end.
2.231.16	Prajapati thought, "Who will be for the creatures and who for me?"
2.231.17	He saw this verse of four feet, the Kavyā, the Upālambhya.
2.231.18	Then he became for the creatures and for himself.
2.231.19	He who knows this becomes for the creatures and himself.
2.231.20	The Agniya animal is either a sacrifice or Agni. He does not want to be separated from the sacrifice or Agni.
2.232.1	And why the Varuna animal is for being released from Varuna.
2.232.2	His creatures were being released from Varun. Vritra, sin, seized them.
2.232.3	He thought, "I will indeed heal them from both sides."
2.232.4	He saw these three-day Soma sacrifices.
2.232.5	He brought them.
2.232.6	He sacrificed with them.
2.232.7	With them he released him from sin, from Vritra.
2.232.8	In that these three days are performed together, he releases his creatures from sin, from Vrtra.
2.232.9	All his creatures, being released from sin, from Vriitra, performed together.
2.232.10	The reason why they are called the Saakamedha sacrifices is that they are performed together.
2.232.11	He who knows this prospers together with offspring and cattle.
2.232.12	The first day of the sacrifice has the Anīkavati (verse) as its Pratipada.
2.232.13	The animal offering is to Agni.
2.232.14	Indra killed Vritra, the evil one, with Agni's army.
2.232.15	Now, the reason why the first day of the fortnight is called 'with a host' is that one slays the evil Vritra with the host of Agni.
2.232.16	He who knows this slays his enemy, the evil one, with the host of Agnis.
2.232.17	The second day of the fortnight has the name 'playful'.
2.232.18	The Agni and the Agni-Indra are the animals.
2.232.19	Now, the Kridani (the fourth day) is so called because the creatures, while playing, were freed from the sin of Vritra.
2.232.20	Then Indra, about to slay Vritra, said to the Maruts, "Play around me with axes in your hands." He (Vritra) will be free from fear and I shall slay him, the sinful one."
2.232.21	The Maruts then played around him with axes in their hands.
2.232.22	He indeed, being fearless, killed Vritra, the evil one.
2.232.23	He who knows this, indeed, kills his enemy, the evil one, being fearless.
2.232.24	The animal sacrifice is dedicated to Agni. Agni is the sacrifice. "One should not be away from the sacrifice and Agni."
2.233.1	And why it is dedicated to Indra and Agni, Agni is the Brahman,
2.233.2	Indra, with the Brahman and the Kshatra, indeed, is united with them both. He slays the wicked Vritra.
2.233.3	He who knows this slays his enemy, the wicked one, with the Brahman, and with the Kshatra.
2.233.4	Vaisvakanari is the first day of the third day.
2.233.5	The Vaisvakanemi, the Upalambhya, the Agnimanti and the Maindramati are for cattle.
2.233.6	Now, the reason why the Vaisvakanemī is the first step is that the Upalambhyā is for Vaisvānara. Vaisvānari is Prajapati. Thus they gratify Prajapati at the end.
2.233.7	And also because the creatures, when they were freed from the sin of Vritra, undertook all the activities, therefore the Vaisvakaṇemi.
2.233.8	The animal sacrifice to Agni is the sacrifice, Agni is the sacrifice; lest he should be separated from the sacrifice and from Agni.
2.234.1	And why the animal sacrifice to Indra?
2.234.2	For Indra was indeed the one who was here before the slaying of Vritra.
2.234.3	Having slain Vritra, he became the great Indra.
2.234.4	For he attains more and more by a greater deed.
2.234.5	Therefore they call the victorious king the great king.
2.234.6	Now this is the Shunahshepa. Whatever power and strength Indra had when he slew Vritra, that was Shunahshepa;
2.234.7	Whatever milk there is of the year when it is produced, that is the chariot;
2.234.8	Whatever power and strength Indra has when he slays Vritra, and whatever milk there is of a year when it is being produced, both of these are of the same nature.
2.234.9	The one who sacrifices for four months is indeed the year.
2.234.10	His (sacrifice) is the great vow of Shunashīri.
2.234.11	He who knows this, obtains as much as one who observes the great vow for a year.
2.234.12	His first day is solar, the second day is solar.
2.234.13	The sun indeed is the first.
2.234.14	The sun is indeed Indra.
2.234.15	The Aindra Mahavrata is performed with the same characteristics.
2.234.16	Indeed, he who performs the Catu-r-masya sacrifices attains heaven in the seasons.
2.234.17	He attains the spring with the first day, the summer with the second, the rainy season with the third, the autumn with the fourth, the winter with the fifth, and the cold season with the sixth.
2.234.18	He goes to the end of the year with the Suna-sirya (stoma).
2.234.19	It becomes the Sarvas toma.
2.234.20	For everything is the Sarvas toma,
2.234.21	and he goes to the end with it.
2.234.22	There are three razor-like blades of iron.
2.234.23	He shaves his hair in the four months, for the sun is endless.
2.234.24	He becomes infinite and enjoys everything. He becomes infinite and eats everything.
2.234.25	He becomes infinite and eats all this.
2.235.1	Now these two-night (sacrifices).
2.235.2	There were two Angirasas, Havishmas and Havishkrit.
2.235.3	Those two, while wandering in the world of women, have gone to the heaven of the good, leaving aside the fathers and grandfathers, the sages and the Angirasas.
2.235.4	When their conduct had ceased, they desired, 'How can we go to that place where the sages, the Angiras, the fathers and grandfathers have gone to the well-done heaven world?'
2.235.5	They practised austerities.
2.235.6	They saw this two-night sacrifice.
2.235.7	They brought it.
2.235.8	They performed it.
2.235.9	Then they went to that place where their Rishis, Angiras, fathers and grandfathers had gone to the well-done heaven.
2.235.10	He who desires, 'Where my fathers and grandfathers have gone to the well done heaven, may I go there,' he should offer this sacrifice.
2.235.11	Where his fathers and grandfathers have gone to the heaven of the good, he follows them.
2.235.12	They also say, "One should perform this sacrifice for the one who is better than his brother."
2.235.13	He who is better is like the one who has died before.
2.235.14	They have attained those who have died before.
2.235.15	Having obtained the better and the more powerful, one becomes (better and) more powerful than oneself.
2.235.16	Some say: One should offer this sacrifice only if one desires offspring.
2.235.17	The first day is the self, the second day is offspring.
2.235.18	One makes the self ready with the first day, and offspring with the second day.
2.236.1	Indeed, this sacrifice of two days is like a good and bad (sacrifice).
2.236.2	If the Jyotiṣṭoma Agniṣṭoma is the first day, then the Atiratra with all stomas is the second day. The stotras are interrupted.
2.236.3	If the Jyotiṣtoma Agniṣṭoma were the first day, the Atiratra would be the second day with all stomas. The stotras would be interrupted.
2.236.4-7	Now if the Jyotiṣṭoma is the first day, then the Atiratra is the last day, and they make the beginning of the sacrifice a patchwork. But because it is the Jyotiṣtoma, they do not make the beginning of sacrifice a patchwork. And because it is the Ukthya, they do not interrupt the Stotras. For indeed this sacrifice is like a goal, which is attained by reaching Viraj.
2.236.8	It is again to be begun.
2.236.9	The Bahispavamāna of the twenty-fourth day of the northern half of the year is the twenty-fourth; the year consists of twenty-four half-months.
2.236.10	The year is the sacrifice; they begin the sacrifice with the sacrifice.
2.236.11	Moreover, the Gāyatrī consists of twenty- four syllables.
2.236.12	The Gāyatrī-s again perform the sacrifice which has been attained.
2.236.13	For no other than the Gāyatrī is able to raise the sacrificial rite.
2.236.14	They say: How can the forty-fourth or the fifty-second not be the mouth, and how can the stomas be in pairs?
2.236.15	How can it be only twenty-four?
2.236.16	He should say: The Gāyatrī has three feet.
2.236.17	They attain that which has three feet.
2.236.18	The Sarvas toma Atiratra is performed. It is for the conquest and advance of all worlds.
2.236.19	For all this is indeed the Stoma.
2.236.20	And also because we have come to these one by one Stomas, having united them all, we shall enjoy the food in them.
2.237.1	The two-day sacrifice is indeed like a broken sacrifice.
2.237.2	The Gāyatrī is to be completed first, the Tristubh next.
2.237.3	Now they say, where are the Jagatī and the Anushtubh?
2.237.4	One should complete the Gāyatrī first, the Tristup, the Jagatī, and the Anushtup next, for the continuity of the metres.
2.237.5	"The verse 'Thou art exalted, O Agni, for the sake of light' is sung in the Andhasvadi metre. The Andhasvadi is the form of the Jagati metre. By it they do not go beyond the forms of the Jagati.
2.237.6	It is the Vaikhanasa Saman, sung to the Jagati metre."
2.237.7	By it they do not exceed the forms of the Jāgati.
2.237.8	Of the two Sāmans, one is sung, as it were, to stand firm against both.
2.237.9	The verse 'The light is gold' is sung.
2.237.10	The Suvar (verse) is the first day, the Jyoti (verse) is of the second day, for the continuity of the days and for the commencement of the days.
2.237.11	The Havismata and Haviskrta are the two verses for heaven, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
2.237.12	They say that the two (priests) should be performed quickly, because they may cause the sacrificer to die before his time. For they go to this world and the other world, disregarding him.
2.237.13	They should perform the Brahma-sāman in the Upavasatha of the northern half.
2.237.14	Thus one attains all his life and goes to heaven.
2.238.1	Now, he who has the Jyotis Utkhya as the previous day and the Ayus Atiratra as the subsequent day, he who performs this (rite) for crossing over, the king who desires offspring, and Khala and Daivavati, he who cuts off,
2.238.2	he then cut off Khala and Daivatī.
2.238.3	He attained this much of offspring.
2.238.4	Three are in excess of the other, and two are deficient in the other.
2.238.5	Those three are in excess of a man, by which he generates.
2.238.6	Those two are deficient in a woman, from which she generates.
2.238.7	This is the union, the generation, that is done.
2.238.8	He who knows this, is born by the union, the generating.
2.238.9	Those two hymns are completed. There are seven hundred and twenty-one such days and nights in a year.
2.238.10	The entire Prajapati is the day and night. We have prospered the entire Prajapati. The entire Prajapati has come to us."
2.238.11	And if one hymn is left over, that is the world of the sacrificer.
2.238.12	The Brahman always said to him, "There is no one like him in the progeny of Praja, who is not born from a womb."
2.238.13	He created his own world, not the world of progeny. He came to this world alone.
2.239.1	Then Hanubhuti said, "Let it be as destiny wills for his progeny."
2.239.2	"I am the god of gods, the god of gods is the one who is beyond."
2.239.3	Thus they trembled and wept over him.
2.239.4	This is the same.
2.239.5	These are the Abhipratarana verses.
2.239.6	Now, if this is the reverse of the Trivrt and Pañcadaśa,
2.239.7	then the Agniṣṭoma becomes the first day,
2.239.8	and the Atiratra becomes the last day.
2.239.9	One who desires offspring should offer this sacrifice.
2.239.10	The Stotras are three-fold and fifteen-fold, deficient and excessive, the two being the begetters of offspring.
2.239.11	One is deficient, the other is excessive.
2.239.12	From the deficient and excessive union offspring and cattle are born.
2.239.13	That is the begetting of offspring.
2.239.14	Its Prstha Stoma is Rathantara.
2.239.15	Rathantara is the begetting.
2.239.16-23	That is the generation. It has twelve praises. There are twelve months in a year. A year is generation. That is the generation. It is done. It has twenty-four praises and hymns. There are twenty-four half-months in a year. A year is generation.
2.239.24	That is the begetting of offspring.
2.239.25	He who knows this is born with offspring and cattle.
2.239.26	The Atiratra with all Stotras takes place. For the conquest and advance of all worlds.
2.239.27	For everything here is indeed Stotras.
2.239.28	Then, having performed the rites of the Stotras one by one, and having established ourselves in them, we shall enjoy the fruits of the rites.
2.240.1	Now, if this (rite) consists of three, fifteen, seventeen, twenty-one, twenty-seven, thirty-three Stotras in the earlier days, and twenty-one, nine, thirty-three in the later days, one desiring heaven should perform this rite.
2.240.2	These Stotras are ascending.
2.240.3	The heavenly world is indeed ascending.
2.240.4	For the attainment of the heavenly world.
2.240.5	The Stotras are ascending,
2.240.6	For by ascending one enjoys the sacrifice.
2.240.7	By this (Stoma) the sacrificer and the sacrificer of oblations went to the heavenly world.
2.240.8	His praises are directed towards the distant, his weapons are directed towards the remote, his hymns are directed towards the far, his praises are directed towards what is far, and he himself becomes directed towards the distant.
2.240.9	Therefore, one should perform this rite only for the benefit of the elder brother, if he does not desire to return to this world, if he does no longer desire to be in this world, if from this world he desires to go to the other world.
2.240.10	He should perform this rite.
2.240.11	Having performed this rite, one attains heaven.
2.240.12	In that, indeed, both the Havis-offerings and the Havis-offering-making are made, for the attainment of heaven, for the attainment (of heaven) of the heavenly world.
2.240.13	They say that they should make up seven hundred and twenty Stotriya verses.
2.240.14	So many are the days and nights of a year.
2.240.15	They do not go beyond the year.
2.240.16	They say, "The number of verses in the Stotriya of the three-day Soma rite should be equal to the number of verses in his Jyotirupa Gaur."
2.240.17	They do not go to the three-day form.
2.240.18	They say, "The Stotriya should be performed with a thousand verses."
2.240.19	The Stotriya of three-day Soma is indeed a thousand.
2.240.20	They do not go beyond the three-night (rite).
2.240.21	This indeed is the prosperous two-night (rite), which is attained by the prosperity of the three-night rite, or the three-night is attained by the four-night.
2.241.1	Now these are the three-night rites.
2.241.2	By the three-night the gods succeeded in these worlds, by the three-night they went to heaven.
2.241.3	The three-night is indeed speech.
2.241.4	The days and the oblations are divided by the form of speech.
2.241.5	Speech is one-syllabled, the syllable is three-syllabled.
2.241.6	The days are divided by the forms of the syllables.
2.241.7	There are three Gandharvas.
2.241.8	Their portions are: Earth for Agni, Space for Vayu, and Heaven for Aditya.
2.241.9	This is said about that:
2.241.10	Three make the seed in the worlds, three are the noble offspring, the foremost of light.
2.241.11	Three hot seasons follow the dawn; all know him, the Vasishthas.
2.241.12	Thus it is said.
2.241.13	"What he says, 'Three make the seed in the worlds', Agni makes seed in the earth, Vayu in the atmosphere, Aditya in heaven. The three noble offspring are headed by light."
2.242.1	Vasus, Rudras, and Adityas.
2.242.2	Their light is headed by that Aditya.
2.242.3	The three summer months follow the dawn. Agni follows the dawn, Vayu follows the dawn, Aditya follows the dawn.
2.242.4	All know him as Vasishtha. Those Brahmanas who are attentive, they are Vasishthas, for they know all this.
2.242.5	This is the extent of the three-night sacrifice.
2.242.6	The Gayatri is the breath, the Trishtup is the eye, the Jagati is the ear.
2.242.7	These are the three pairs. The two that are born from the pair are the third.
2.242.8	Indra took up the thunderbolt against Vritra.
2.242.9	Vishnu followed him.
2.242.10	He said, "Is there any of this in you? The power of energy and strength?"
2.242.11	"Bring it to me."
2.242.12	"Do not harm me."
2.242.13	"So be it."
2.242.14	He gave it to him.
2.242.15	Vishnu accepted it.
2.242.16	He gave him the second one.
2.242.17	Vishnu followed him.
2.242.18	He said, "Is there any of this in me, the power of energy and strength?"
2.242.19	"Bring it to me."
2.242.20	"Do not harm me."
2.242.21	"So be it."
2.242.22	He gave it to him.
2.242.23	Vishnu accepted it.
2.242.24	He gave him the third (part).
2.242.25	Vishnu followed him.
2.242.26	He said, "Is there anything in this (world)?" "There is the power of energy and strength."
2.242.27	"Bring it to me."
2.242.28	"Do not harm me."
2.242.29	"So be it."
2.242.30	He gave it to him.
2.242.31	Vishnu accepted it.
2.242.32	While it was being offered, Indra said, "Everything is mine." Vishnu said, "The third part is mine."
2.243.1	They are indeed the questioners.
2.243.2	They asked the two Prajapatis.
2.243.3	He replied to them with this (verse):
2.243.4	"You both strove, but neither of you conquered. Neither of you conquered.
2.243.5	O Indra and Vishnu, when you competed, you divided the thousand into three parts."
2.243.6	Thus it is said.
2.243.7	"Two parts are yours," he said to Indra, "and the third is yours" to Vishnu.
2.243.8	He gave this to them.
2.243.9	He gives it to one who has relatives and is a good speaker on the first day.
2.243.10	Just as this earth is, so is he.
2.243.11	This earth is established, so is he established.
2.243.12	Then he gives it to one without relatives and a good speaker on second day.
2.243.13	Just as this is the space, so is he.
2.243.14	They know this as space. They know the Veda.
2.243.15	And he who is related and not a stranger, to him one should give on the third day.
2.243.16	Just as this is the sky, so is he
2.243.17	They know this sky. They know the relation.
2.243.18	They are given every day in tens.
2.243.19	The Viraj has ten syllables.
2.243.20	The sacrifice is Viraj.
2.243.21	It is given every day in ten parts.
2.243.22	They are given every day as hundreds.
2.243.23	This is the measure of the sacrifice, namely, a hundred.
2.243.24	It is divided and given every day.
2.243.25	One should give thirty-three and three hundred on the first day.
2.243.26	On the second day, he should give thirty-three and three hundred.
2.243.27	On the third day, he should offer thirty-three and another three hundred.
2.243.28	Now this is the thousandth, with three forms and two deities.
2.243.29	Of that, two parts are for Brahma and one for the Agnidh.
2.244.1	Prajapati was here first.
2.244.2	Not seeing any second, his speech itself became his own. Speech was the second. He thought, "Let me release this speech."
2.244.3	"This alone, when released, will be able to accomplish everything."
2.244.4	He released it as "Speech."
2.244.5	It flowed upward like a continuous stream of water.
2.244.6	He came to her and cut off one syllable.
2.244.7	This became this.
2.244.8	"It was, or it is, this."
2.244.9	That is the earth's earth-ness.
2.244.10	"Ke" is the second.
2.244.11	This became the sky.
2.244.12	"It is, as it were, between both."
2.244.13	That is space's space-ness.
2.244.14	Ho is the third, which he threw upwards.
2.244.15	That became the sky.
2.244.16	It shone like the sun.
2.244.17	That is the sky's sky-ness.
2.244.18	Prajapati, here, divided the single-syllabled speech into three parts.
2.244.19	These became the worlds, the stars, and the means of livelihood.
2.244.20	He lamented, he was distressed.
2.244.21	He thought, "How can these worlds be covered with hair and become self-sustaining?"
2.244.22	He saw this three-day sacrifice.
2.244.23	He brought it.
2.244.24	He performed it.
2.244.25	He extended it to these worlds.
2.244.26	Then these worlds were covered with hair and became self-sustaining.
2.244.27	This is the essence of the three-night (rite), the purification of the three-nights, which is in these worlds.
2.244.28	One goes to the world of animals, of bipeds and quadrupeds, who knows this.
2.245.1	Just as a jewel is strung on a string of jewels, so is the three-night strung on these worlds.
2.245.2	His face shines, who knows this.
2.245.3	This indeed is the direct speech of the tongue, which it utters when it comes to the tip of the tongue.
2.245.4	It utters this speech when it comes to its middle.
2.245.5	All the essence of speech is uttered above, when it says "Ho."
2.245.6	For "Ho" is indeed all speech.
2.245.7	And when these forms are applied to the clarified butter and the days,
2.245.8	They let out speech from the mouth itself, for the sacrificial act is performed from the mouth.
2.245.9	When Prajapati let out speech, it sounded.
2.245.10	The first syllable of that was 'kṣe', the second was 'raḍ', the third was 'i'.
2.245.11	Now, whatever form Prajapati assumed when he uttered speech, in that form the animals are started and in that form the days are completed.
2.245.12	Indeed, this sacrifice of three days is the best of sacrifices.
2.245.13	The syllable is three syllables.
2.245.14	The three-syllabled one is the three-day sacrifice.
2.245.15	The three days are the syllable.
2.246.3	The Bahispavamāna hymns of these days are the head.
2.246.4	The two days on either side are the wings.
2.246.5	The middle day is the body.
2.246.6	The Agniṣṭoma Sāman is the tail.
2.246.7	Some say that the rising sun is the head.
2.246.8	Two days on either side of it are the wings.
2.246.9	The middle day is the Self.
2.246.10	Fire is the tail.
2.246.11	Some say that the rising sun is the head.
2.246.12	The days on either side are the wings.
2.246.13	The middle day is the self.
2.246.14	What sets is the tail.
2.247.1	The first day of the three-day sacrifice is dedicated to speech, the second to the vital breath, and the third to the eye.
2.247.2	They say, "How long is the three-day (sacrifice)?"
2.247.3	One should say, "This much."
2.247.4	Because this much is it.
2.247.5	Or one should say, "So much."
2.247.6	Because so much is it.
2.247.7	They say, "The three nights are in the past, the others are in the future."
2.247.8	One should say, "The others are in the past."
2.247.9	For one speaks in the past, breathes in the past, sees in the past, hears in the past.
2.247.10	Or one should say, "Both in the past and in the future."
2.247.11	He speaks both the near and the far, he breathes both the near and far, he sees both the near and afar, he hears both the near and distant.
2.247.12	They say, "One, three nights, two, three."
2.247.13	One should say, "One."
2.247.14	For he is one, namely, the breath, the out-breath, the through-breath.
2.247.15	They say, "May it be one more than a thousand."
2.247.16	One should say, "One."
2.247.17	For one is indeed more than a thousand in counting.
2.248.1	"Speech alone."
2.248.2	The first day of the three-day sacrifice is Gāyatrī, the second is Trisṭubh, and the third is Jagatī.
2.248.3	Or, the other one is the reverse of the three-night (rite). What is the reverse of this one is the reverse for the other one.
2.248.4	What is done here is that the higher day is made lower. For the sacrificer they produce cattle. For in the other world cattle are not produced.
2.248.5	These indeed are the most vigorous of the metres, namely, the Gāyatrī and the Tristubh.
2.248.6	In that the Gāyatrī and the Tristubha are on both sides, and the animals in the middle are the Jagatī, they thus surround the sacrificer with the two vigorous metres on both sides for the purpose of protection.
2.248.7	He whose wealth is not taken away by others knows this.
2.248.8	That very one is the three-night (rite) which shines.
2.248.9	As it rises, so is its first day; as it is at midday, so is the second; as it sets, so is the third.
2.248.10	He who knows this thus goes to his union and companionship.
2.249.1	Indra, having won a thousand skins from the Maruts, announced it to Soma, the king, in his own assembly.
2.249.2	And now, in imitation of that, they proclaim this to the king and make him rejoice.
2.249.3	Then Yama understood that a thousand had died.
2.249.4	He came.
2.249.5	He came and said, "Call me in this thousand."
2.249.6	"So be it."
2.249.7	They called him.
2.249.8	He saw her in this thousand, carrying the milk of a thousand cows.
2.249.9	He said, "This one is mine, and that one is yours."
2.249.10	The other two said, "Whatever you see in her, we see that." He said, "Let us do this with her."
2.249.11	They made it with that very (water).
2.249.12	They said, "Let us bring the shares. To whomsoever of us will come first."
2.249.13	They brought the shares.
2.249.14	Soma came first.
2.249.15	Then Indra, then Yama.
2.249.16	They put it in the water.
2.250.1	They said, "Give to Soma. With the third part of yourself and the third part of the thousand."
2.250.2	She, the tawny-coloured one, with reddish eyes, rose up with the third part of herself and with the third part (of the price).
2.250.3	This is the Soma-purchasing cow.
2.250.4	With the third part of her and with the third (part of the price) indeed, O king, Soma is purchased.
2.250.5	They again introduced her into the water.
2.250.6	They said to her, "Give it to Indra, with a third of yourself and a third of the thousand."
2.250.7	She went up to the post-hole, with a third part of herself and a third of a thousand.
2.250.8	This is given to Indra.
2.250.9	With a third part of himself and a third of his thousand, he gives it to her.
2.250.10	They again put her in the water.
2.250.11	They said to her, "Give Yama, the third part of yourself and the third part of the thousand."
2.250.12	She, the smoky Diti, rose up, the smallest, the youngest, the oldest, the crooked-horned, the third part herself and the third part the thousand.
2.250.13	This is the Anustarana.
2.250.14	And by the third (verse) he makes the third thousand of the thousand with its attendant (verses).
2.250.15	One should not think that he has done it by chance.
2.251.1	They say, "There is no room for a thousand in this world."
2.251.2	"For oneself, not for oneself."
2.251.3	They say, “How far is the heavenly world?”
2.251.4	"As many as a thousand cows are established in the cow-world, so many are there."
2.251.5	"As many as a thousands beings breathe together, so many are the cows," "As many as thousands of horses," "As many are the chariots," "As many is the day."
2.251.6	One attains that by means of the cow.
2.251.7	That cow, Sabhalī, which is to be offered in the Prsthya sacrifice, stands in the other world as a cow that yields what is desired to him who knows this.
2.251.8	He leads the Tarpya cow to the right side for the sake of being the source of a thousand.
2.251.9	When he created the thousand, its source was the Tarpya cow alone.
2.251.10	When he takes the Tarpya cup, he takes it to the south. He makes it a thousand-fold along with the seed.
2.251.11	He who knows this stands with the thousand-fold seed.
2.251.12	The one who is the thousandth, to her one should recite the ear. To the shining, to the shining, to Aditi, to Sarasvati, these are your names, O Agni, tell us the well-done ones among the gods."
2.251.13	Indeed, the gods tell him what is well-done.
2.251.14	He makes her smell the pot, saying, "Smell the pot, may the drops enter thee; may it yield us a thousand, flowing abundantly, and full of milk."
2.251.15	He who knows this, is given a thousand, and stands for a thousand.
2.252.1	Prajapati indeed was the first to know this.
2.252.2	He desired, 'May I be many, may I beget, may I attain the earth.'
2.252.3	He practised austerities.
2.252.4	He created speech.
2.252.5	He fashioned the cow from speech.
2.252.6	He thought, 'It is enough for me that I am this.
2.252.7	If I were to create, I would obtain food. Let me create.'
2.252.8	He created the Vasus, the Rudras, and the Adityas.
2.252.9	The Vasus approached him, saying, "May it be ours."
2.252.10	He gave them this cow.
2.252.11	They protected her for a year.
2.252.12	She produced thirty-three and three hundred offspring for them.
2.252.13	She was born again.
2.252.14	The Rudras approached him, saying,
2.252.15	He gave them this cow.
2.252.16	They protected her for a year.
2.252.17	She produced thirty-three thousand and three hundred calves for them in that year.
2.252.18	She again gave birth to a calf.
2.252.19	The Adityas approached her, saying, "Let there be our own."
2.252.20	He gave them this cow again.
2.252.21	They protected it for a year.
2.252.22	She gave birth to them in thirty-three years and three hundred years.
2.252.23	That became a thousand.
2.252.24	She herself became the thousandth.
2.252.25	She gave birth to her again.
2.252.26	He who, knowing thus, protects the cows, indeed, they attain his thousand.
2.252.27	Therefore, the cows should be protected by one who knows thus.
2.252.28	They said, "It is enough for him that we should sacrifice with a thousand."
2.252.29	"Let us sacrifice with this thousand."
2.253.1	They made it equal to a thousand.
2.253.2	That thousand was not enough for one cow.
2.253.3	They said, "Let us ask Prajapati for this thousandth."
2.253.4	They requested Prajapati for that thousandth (cow).
2.253.5	Prajapati thought, 'If I give it to them, they will be envious. If I do not give it to them their thousand will be incomplete.'
2.253.6	He thought, 'I will bring them together with that very (cow).'
2.253.7	He said to them, 'I will come to you with that very (thousandth cow).'
2.253.8	They said, 'Yes.'
2.253.9	He approached them with her.
2.253.10	They saw that sacrifice of three nights.
2.253.11	They brought it.
2.253.12	He said, "Let us perform this sacrifice with the same (sacrifice). Let us not perform with the unequal (sacrifice)."
2.253.13	They said, "With the same."
2.253.14	When they said, "With same," they made the year same, the country same, and the name same.
2.253.15	If he had said, "With the unequal," then the year would have been unequal, the country would have been unequal and there would have been no recognition.
2.253.16	"With what shall we be equal?"
2.253.17	"With the Yajnayajniya."
2.253.18	Therefore they are united with the Yajnayajnīya.
2.253.19	The Yajnayajnya is speech.
2.253.20	Speech is these worlds.
2.253.21	He ascends speech with speech.
2.253.22	They gave thirty-three and three hundred on the first day.
2.253.23	By that he prospered in this world with wealth.
2.253.24	They gave thirty-three hundred and three on the second day.
2.253.25	By this he prospered in the world of the sky with Rudras.
2.253.26	The thirty-three gods and the three hundred gods gave it on the third day.
2.253.27	By that he attained the world of the sun.
2.253.28	He who, knowing this, performs this sacrifice attains these gods and these worlds.
2.254.1	Prajapati, having created a thousand in the beginning, gave it to the creatures, saying, "This is yours together."
2.254.2	When he said, "Together," that became the thousandfoldness of the thousand.
2.254.3	Therefore, indeed, one should be like a thousand-holder.
2.254.4	For he said, "together."
2.254.5	He who would say to her, "I give you a thousand cows," would be as good as his word.
2.254.6	The gods said to the lord of the gods, "You are indeed the best."
2.254.7	"Release him."
2.254.8	He brought down the essence of the three thousandfold (cows) in these three forms: Taratni-dhana, Eni-dhana and Trinidhana.
2.254.9	These are the Sāmans to be performed at the Tri-sahasra-Sahasra-Sahasrātra sacrifice. They are the Sāman of the Lord of the East, extracted.
2.254.10	He who knows this, is extracted.
2.254.11	Therefore, these Sāmans should be performed at the Sahasra-Sahsra-Sahasrātra sacrifice. They belong to the Lord of the Eastern Quarter, the entire Sāmans. The Lord of the Sacrificer, the one who desires cattle.
2.254.12	But if he gives a thousand of the other kind, it would be as if he gave a thousand.
2.254.13	The duties themselves are for the sake of a thousand.
2.254.14	When Prajapati gave a thousand to the gods, they ate it without waiting for it.
2.254.15	That which was being eaten by the gods disappeared.
2.254.16	They then consulted each other.
2.254.17	It said, "I am afraid of loss."
2.254.18-21	They said, "No." "So that we may be as we were before, and not be drunk or destroyed today." "He said, 'You will make me true.' "Therefore they made him true by the truth-maker, and made him true by truth-maker, truth-maker, they made him true. And they made him true with the truth-maker. And they made truth-maker true. And they caused him to be born with the truth-making, and made him truth-making, truth-making, they made him truth-maker. They made him truth-giving, and made him giving, giving, they made him giving. They made him giving, and made him giver, giver, they made him giver. They made him giver, and made him gift, gift, they made him gift. They made him gift, and made him givable, givable, they made him givable. They made him givable and made him giveless, giveless, they made him without gift. They made it giveless and made it giveless, givelesss, they made it giveless. They made it without gift and made it without gift, without gift, they made it without gift. They caused it to be born without gift, and made it without giving, without giving, they made it giving. They made it giving, and made it giving, giving, it made it giving. It made it giving, it made giving, giving, made it giving. They made it giving, they made giving, giving made it giving. Giving made it giving, made giving, giving it
2.255.7	The daily milking of the animals is indeed the animals themselves.
2.255.8	The daily milking of the cattle is indeed the animals.
2.255.9	These worlds are the daily milking of the cows.
2.255.10	The daily milkin of the cattle is these worlds.
2.255.11	Agni's milking, Vayu's milking, Asau Aditya's milking.
2.255.12	If the milkings are done every day, then one stands firm in these deities.
2.255.13	These worlds are called 'milking'.
2.255.14	These are their milkings.
2.255.15	He who knows this milks these worlds.
2.255.16	The Arkas (verses) are recited daily. The Arka is food; for the securing of food.
2.255.17	The Arka verse on the first day has the word 'svashira' (own head).
2.255.18	Water is the own head.
2.255.19	Water is food.
2.255.20	One does not reach the end of the path without water.
2.255.21	The Arka on the second day has the word Agni (fire).
2.255.22	The second day has the sky as its abode.
2.255.23	The sky is indeed the darkness, and the Rākṣasas are associated with it. Agni is indeed the destroyer of Rākṣasas, for the destruction of Rākṣasa alone.
2.255.24	The long-darkened sun is on the third day.
2.255.25	The long darkened sun is indeed the one who is awake.
2.255.26	The third day is indeed the one that is awake.
2.255.27	They indeed make it equal to the day in form.
2.256.1	They are performed daily, for heaven, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
2.256.2	They say, "The Sāman chants are swift, the lord takes the sacrificer before his life is over."
2.256.3	"Two should be performed, for falling down alone."
2.256.4	They say, "It accomplishes him in that way."
2.256.5	"One should be performed, only for the attainment of heaven."
2.256.6	What to speak of those who would destroy it? All the rites are indeed performed.
2.256.7	By performing the three-night rite, the gods went upward to the heavenly world.
2.256.8	But he, not included among them, was left behind.
2.256.9	He, having been stretched out by Gayatriparshva, was stretched out by Santani, made uniform by Samantani, made uniform in three joints by Samandhina, made uniform by Shrayantiya, and made free from injury by Arista.
2.256.10	Now, the reason why these Sāmans are performed is to make the three-day sacrifice complete, to make it continuous, to make it well-performed, to make it united, to make it firm, to make it without injury.
2.256.11	The Aindri, Kakubhi, Svarāri, and Ushniha.
2.256.12	They place the three-day (sacrifice) in the middle, so that it may not be lost.
2.257.1	And the Gāyatrī metre is composed of six and ten Stotriya verses.
2.257.2	And the Tristubh metre is composed of three and one Stotriya verse.
2.257.3	And the Jagatī metre is composed of two Savanas and Anushtubh verses.
2.257.4	The third Savana is composed of twenty-one and sixteen verses.
2.257.5	The Sodasi desired to be the Apitva of the two former days.
2.257.6	The Sodasi desired to become the Apitva on the two former days (of the fortnight).
2.257.7	He was approached by these eleven Stotriyas.
2.257.8	He became the Sodasi in the Anushtubh metre.
2.257.9	Now he who knows the sixteen-fold (Stoma) in the two preceding days, he who is the giver, he becomes the giver in the two preceding sixteen-fold days. He becomes the giver where he desires, 'May I be the giver.'
2.257.10	They say, 'One attains the six-day (Stoma) by the Stomas, the tenth day by the Sampada and the Chandomas.'
2.257.11	He who knows this, obtains the twelve-day sacrifice with gifts.
2.257.12	Now this is the thousandth (cow). If one were to give it, one would be impoverished; if one were not to give it, his thousand would be incomplete.
2.257.13	One should not give the cow of the month of Kārtika and the cow of the year.
2.257.14	That is a pair.
2.257.15	From that one is born.
2.257.16	They say, "It becomes like that only if it is not given. One conquers only a part."
2.257.17	One should give a thousand or a part.
2.257.18	One should give the part or a thousand. It is ignorance. One should redeem it today with a cow."
2.257.19	They say, "It is given only if it is given.
2.257.20	The cow is one thing, the thread of wool is another. One should buy it for as much as one thinks it is worth.
2.257.21	The thread of wool is a bit like a cow.
2.257.22	One gives a thousand, but does not lose oneself.
2.257.23	Just as one would bind a herd of cattle with a rope or a stick, so does he bind the cattle for the purpose of not letting them go away.
2.257.24	He whose wealth is not taken away by others knows this.
2.258.1	The sea is variegated, the earth is his, the Brahman-goddess is his first-born, the one syllable of truth, thou art shining, thou art shining forth, thou art shining above the worlds, thou art shining with the light of the gods, thou art shining. We know thee, O shining one, shining with light, shining, thou art the earth, shining, thou shinest.
2.258.2	Thou art splendour, thou art the bright, thou art the immortal, thou art food, thou art the great, thou art this, thou art the greatness. Thus do I know thee.
2.258.3	In thee, in that (earth), the gods have placed this Dakshina, the imperishable, the inexhaustible, the great light of the gods, the most brilliant of creatures, the covered one, the follower of the followers.
2.258.4	This indeed is the most shining and greatest, namely, that Aditya.
2.258.5	Of her these two are the two feet, namely, day and night, truth and falsehood.
2.258.6	Of her this is the true foot, namely, day.
2.258.7	This is called the 'transcendent'.
2.258.8	He who knows this 'transcendent' foot of hers, he indeed transcends others in progeny, cattle, glory, fame and life.
2.259.1	Now this is his dark-spotted foot, which is the night.
2.259.2	He who knows this dark-spotted foot of his becomes dark-spotted with offspring, cattle, prosperity, fame, and life.
2.259.3	Just as one would offer oblations to a burning fire, so does the Brahman, speaking the truth, burn himself.
2.259.4	He should speak the truth, act the truth, desire the truth, and be the truth.
2.259.5	But if he is tempted to lie, it may be for the sake of life, or for the sake of a woman, or for the purpose of sport, or for the friendship.
2.259.6	He should speak it in the shade of night.
2.259.7	Then it does not harm him.
2.259.8	For he speaks it in his own place.
2.259.9	The earth is called Prithvi.
2.259.10	He, she, she, she. The mind is yours, the sacrifice is yours, you are the ghee of the sacrifice, you are the one who is to be worshipped. The seasons are in your mind, the mind is in the village. You are the bearer of the entering. I am the one who delights, you are the delight. You are the one who delights. You are the heaven. You are the nourishing one. You are the giver of nourishment. You are the spotted one. Come here. I am the bearer of the sand. I am the mother of a thousand. I know you, O man, the one who is so. Tell me this, so that this will happen.
2.260.1	O Agni, thou art the Hotar of the gods; I am the Hotar of men. Tell me this, that it may be so. The Sama does not meet the Sama, the Stotra does not meet the Stotra, my worlds do not pass over to him. The world of the sacrificer becomes greater.
2.260.2	If the Sama met the Sama, if the Stotra met the Stotra, if these worlds passed over to him, the world of the sacrificers would become smaller.
2.260.3	It (the Gāyatrī) is equal to the Gāyatrī.
2.260.4	The Gāyatrī is indeed the vital breath.
2.260.5	For everywhere the vital breath is equal.
2.260.6	It (the Gāyatra) is equal to Yajñāyajñiya.
2.260.7	The Yajñāyājñiya is indeed speech.
2.260.8	For everywhere speech and vital breath are equal.
2.260.9	Two Sāman verses are equal. The sacrificer has two feet for stability.
2.260.10	He who knows this stands firm.
2.261.1	Indeed, Prajāpati was the first to know this.
2.261.2	He desired, 'May I be many, may I beget, may I attain the earth.'
2.261.3	He sorrowed.
2.261.4	He tormented himself.
2.261.5	While he was sorrowing and tormenting himself, the vital airs spoke to him, 'We have seen this sacrifice of yours. We shall sacrifice for you.'
2.261.6	He said, 'How did you see it? What did you see?'
2.261.7	They said, "Let us proclaim!" "Let us hear!"
2.261.8	"Let us sacrifice!" "Let us worship!"
2.261.9	"Let it be so!" "We have seen this."
2.261.10	He knew, "We have seen."
2.261.11	Since there were five, the sacrifice is fivefold.
2.261.12	He knew, "We have seen."
2.261.13	Of these five, the seventeen syllables were the seventeen Prajapati. The sacrifice is connected with Prajapati.
2.261.14	He knew them by means of that (knowledge). He saw them.
2.261.15	He said: "By whom shall we offer? In what shall we offer?"
2.261.16	They said, "We will offer your own victim, having dug it out, in your own heart, as the All-offering."
2.261.17	They dug out the victim of Prajapati.
2.261.18	Breath alone announced to them, Out-breath announced back.
2.261.19	Mind alone was the Hotar.
2.261.20	Prajapati himself was the fourth Brahman, sitting on the right.
2.261.21	They offered her in the fire of Prajapati, the all-consuming fire.
2.261.22	When they offered her, she became the offering.
2.261.23	When they had offered her, they offered her again.
2.261.24	Therefore one should offer her.
2.261.25	For everything is born from the offered (seed). The goat is offered to her.
2.262.1	The white, hairy, with a tuft on the head, with a tail, with four feet, was born.
2.262.2	In him he saw all forms.
2.262.3	They said, "All these forms are in him."
2.262.4	"We shall obtain him alone."
2.262.5	They obtained him.
2.262.6	His breath alone announced, his out-breath announced in return,
2.262.7	Mind itself was the Hotar.
2.262.8	Prajapati himself was the fourth Brahman, sitting on the right side.
2.262.9	They offered everything to Agni in Prajapati's heart.
2.262.10	From that offering, Agni was born as the deity.
2.262.11	That is the Veda of the Rig verses.
2.262.12	The wind god was born as the next deity.
2.262.13	That are the Yajus verses of the Veda.
2.262.14	The sun was born as the deity.
2.262.15	The Vedas are the Sama hymns.
2.262.16	These three best gods and these three kinds of creation were born.
2.262.17	This much alone was created by Prajapati.
2.262.18	Now, by these deities, this entire other (world) was created.
2.262.19	They said, "Let us perform the sacrifice by which our father Prajapati was satisfied."
2.262.20	They brought him.
2.262.21	Vayu himself announced, Aditya responded,
2.262.22	Agni himself was the Hotri.
2.262.23	Prajapati himself was the Brahma, the moon was the fourth, and he sat to the south.
2.263.1	They themselves sat around the four Hotri.
2.263.2	These indeed are the four Hotṛs, whom they call the four Hotṛ-priests.
2.263.3	At the thousandth oblation of them a cow was born.
2.263.4	In her he saw all the enjoyments, whatever enjoyments there are in a cow.
2.263.5	They said, "All the enjoyments are in her."
2.263.6	"Let us say, 'Let her generate these for us.'"
2.263.7	They said to her, "Do you generate us."
2.263.8	She generated thirty-three and three hundred for Agni.
2.263.9	She generated thirty three and three hundred for Vayu.
2.263.10	She generated three hundred and three for Aditya.
2.263.11	That became a thousand.
2.263.12	She herself was the thousandth.
2.263.13	She was born again.
2.263.14	He who, knowing this, protects his cattle, indeed, he attains a thousand.
2.263.15	Therefore, cattle should be protected by one who knows this.
2.263.16	They said, "It is enough for us that we do not go away from here and the sacrificers do not come here."
2.263.17	They went away from here and did not come here.
2.263.18	They were neither better nor worse.
2.263.19	They said, "We were neither better nor worst."
2.263.20	"Let us sacrifice with this thousand."
2.264.1	They made it half a thousand.
2.264.2	That thousand of theirs was the number of one cow.
2.264.3	They said, "We shall ask Prajapati for this thousandth (cow)."
2.264.4	They asked Prajapati for that thousandth (cow).
2.264.5	Prajapati thought, "If I give it to them, they will be envious; if I do not give it to them their thousand will be incomplete."
2.264.6	He brought them together with that very (cow).
2.264.7	He said to them, "I will come with you and her."
2.264.8	"So be it."
2.264.9	He came with her.
2.264.10	They saw this three-night sacrifice.
2.264.11	They brought it.
2.264.12	He said, "Let us perform this sacrifice with the same, not with the different."
2.264.13	They said, "With the same."
2.264.14	When they said, "Let us be equal," they made the year equal. They made the country and the name equal.
2.264.15	If they had said, "Let it be unequal," the year would have been unequal, the country would have been unequal and the name would have been unequal.
2.264.16	"By what shall we be equal?"
2.264.17	"By the Yajnayajniya."
2.264.18	Therefore they are equal by the Yajnayajnīya.
2.264.19	Speech is the Yajñāyajñiya.
2.264.20	Speech is these worlds.
2.264.21	By speech he ascended speech.
2.264.22	They gave thirty-three and three hundred on the first day.
2.264.23	By that Agni attained in this world.
2.264.24	They gave three hundred and thirty on the second day.
2.264.25	Therefore, in this world of the atmosphere, Vayu became prosperous.
2.264.26	They gave thirty-three hundred and three on the third day.
2.264.27	Therefore, in that world, Aditya became prosperous.
2.264.28	He who, knowing this, performs this sacrifice, prospers in these deities and attains these worlds.
2.265.1	That which was the thousandth, it became lightning and entered Prajapati.
2.265.2	This is said about that:
2.265.3	This is the one that shines, by which the cow is covered, seeking its life, settled on the ashes.
2.265.4	It made the mortal one with its thoughts. Becoming lightning, it sought the fire.
2.265.5	Thus it is said.
2.265.6	Having abandoned this form of the cow, it enters Prajapati again, becoming lightning.
2.265.7	This is that lightning. When it thunders, it says, "Give! Give!"
2.265.8	It indeed gives rain and food to creatures. It says, "I will give! I will give!"
2.265.9	This deity gives rain and food for us. He who knows this.
2.266.1	Now this is the horse sacrifice.
2.266.2	One who desires progeny should offer this sacrifice.
2.266.3	Prajapati desired, "May I beget many offspring and cattle, may I attain the worlds, may I attain Indra's power."
2.266.4	He saw this sacrifice.
2.266.5	He brought it.
2.266.6	He offered it.
2.266.7	Then indeed he became many, with offspring and cattle, he attained the worlds of the gods, and obtained the power of Indra.
2.266.8	He who desires, 'May I beget many offspring and cattle, may I attain the worlds of the Gods, may I obtain the power of Indra,' let him offer this sacrifice.
2.266.9-10	He who knows this becomes very prolific in progeny and cattle, attains the worlds of the virtuous, and obtains the power of the senses.
2.266.11	When they were first created, all were endowed with energy. The Brāhmaṇa was born as a sage, the creator of mantras; the Kṣatriya as a hero, the Vaiśya as a nourisher, the Śūdra as a worker, the woman as a virtuous wife.
2.266.12	The crops grew without being sown.
2.266.13	But even a single handful of cooked rice is enough to feed a family.
2.266.14	So, then, everything is indeed endowed with milk.
2.266.15	But in the forest, animals are born with great strength: lions, tigers, bears, bear cubs, snakes, and pythons.
2.266.16	The tigers among men, the Smaraṇyas, stand guarding the forests.
2.266.17	And a certain Śiṃśumāra protects many holy places.
2.266.18	It is by their valour that they are able to do so.
2.267.1	From his forehead was born the lion, from his chest the tiger, from his belly the bear, from his eyes the antelope, from his ears the horse-eared (deer), from his mane the bears and bearesses, from his hair the Dūrvā grass, from his navel the crocodile, from his tail the horse-tailed (deer), from the joints of his legs the cranes, from his testicles the boars, from his mouth the Cakravāka birds, from his anus the Udra, from his anus (the animal called) Aja, from his anus serpents, from his anus Vartakas, from his anus Śalyakas, from his anus Kūṣmāṇḍas, from his penis the Urvarus, from his penis Tanti-Santanta, from his penis Śyāmāka, from his penis Lohitika. Thus was born this small food.
2.268.1	They say, "Which one is to be offered?"
2.268.2	They say, "The one who is heard from afar."
2.268.3	He is heard because of his strength.
2.268.4	This sacrifice is strength.
2.268.5	Some say, "The stronger of the two yoked ones is to be offered."
2.268.6	He is stronger because of his strength
2.268.7	This sacrifice is the strength.
2.268.8	At that time, Shaunaka and Kapya Abhipatarana were engaged in a discussion about the nature of the animal to be offered.
2.268.9	They decided on a black-and-white animal.
2.268.10	The animal that is white and has black or the animal that is black and has white is indeed Prajapati's limb.
2.268.11	Prajapati's eye fell out.
2.268.12	It fell down.
2.268.13	It entered the water.
2.268.14	Then the horse came into being.
2.268.15	Because it was a horse, it is a horse.
2.268.16	Because it became a horse, it became putrid. Because it entered the water, it became white.
2.268.17	There is a black in the white eye or there is a white in the black eye.
2.268.18	That is the same as the part of Prajapati.
2.268.19	They offer it to him.
2.269.1	Maudnibh Udaneyu performed this sacrifice, and became king of the Udaneyus.
2.269.2	Then Yavakri Saumastambhi sat down in front of him.
2.269.3	They made these formulas for him: "Pusha, wealth, Bhaga."
2.269.4	He said, "Do not be angry, Maudbhibh, you have not taken away my life."
2.269.5	This was the discussion that took place then.
2.269.6	Then Maundibha Udanika, who knew the three Vedas, was the Hotri priest.
2.269.7	He said, "Cover the sacrificial post with clay and place my cups in it."
2.269.8	"When this Brahmanic Hotri priest dies, then we will sacrifice."
2.269.9	They placed the Grahas in the earth, having mixed them with clay.
2.269.10	Then there was a certain Yavakri, a son of Soma-stambhi, who was brilliant and had the lustre of Brahman.
2.269.11	He died when he was desired by a woman.
2.269.12	He died even when he was not desired by a woman (i.e. he died even when he did not desire her).
2.269.13	He desired the wife of Rajastambayana, who was learned in the Vedas.
2.269.14	She thought, "If I desire him, he will die. He will die."
2.269.15	"Let me desire him."
2.269.16	"If a Brahmin dies after doing something pleasing to me."
2.269.17	He said to her, "Wait here."
2.269.18	"I will come to you."
2.270.1	His wife, crying and wearing her hair loose, came to him.
2.270.2	He said to her, "What are you doing? Why are you crying?"
2.270.3	She said, "You will die." She was indeed compassionate towards herself.
2.270.4	"Yavakri, indeed, told her."
2.270.5	He said, "Bring ghee from here."
2.270.6	Having purified it with two strainers, he made her offer it.
2.270.7	"She who today protects us, prepared by Bharadvaja,
2.270.8	"O Agni, bring to me that beloved of Agni, the one who is dear to Agni, Svāhā."
2.270.9	Thus it is said.
2.270.10	For her, Hayati created a Gandharva named Irsha, who was jealous.
2.270.11	He said to him, "That is your wife who has gone to Yavakriya."
2.270.12	"That is true."
2.270.13	For her, Irsha followed.
2.270.14	She became angry.
2.270.15	He said, "It seems you have not done anything wrong to me.
2.270.16	Then he said, "Smara."
2.270.17	"What?"
2.270.18	"You will die."
2.270.19	She, taking his foot, said, "You are not a man who would kill a woman."
2.270.20	The two laughed, and sat down below.
2.270.21	They sat down either together or separately.
2.270.22	Then this Gandharva, with a hammer in his hand, began to strike.
2.270.23	He said, "Salutations to you."
2.270.24	What is the atonement for it?"
2.271.1	He said, "Is there or is there not?"
2.271.2	Whatever wealth your father had, cut off the head of that entire wealth before the sun rises.
2.271.3	It may be so or it may not be so."
2.271.4	He began to cut it off in that way.
2.271.5	They said, "Let us bind Yavakrī."
2.271.6	"No," said his father.
2.271.7	"My son is doing what the gods have ordered."
2.271.8	"He alone knows what is best here."
2.271.9	But the deaf carpenter in the village did not hear the prohibition.
2.271.10	He went to kill him.
2.271.11	"Who among us will be able to stop him?"
2.272.2	The Brahman who is able to reply to a question is immortal.
2.272.3	They did so.
2.272.4	Soma-stambhi came to know of it and went there.
2.272.5	He sat down in the same way.
2.272.6	For him they used these words: "O Pūṣan, O Wealth, O Bhaga."
2.272.7	He said, "This king's kinsman did not know this sacrificial rite."
2.272.8	"He did not tell me that he killed his son."
2.272.9	"This was the life of his son."
2.272.10	He cursed him, "This king will die. His descendants will be the Maundibha."
2.272.11	Those who are defeated by him, the Gotama, go on speaking.
2.272.12	"He who is running, he is running," they say, and they run in the same way.
2.272.13	Therefore the horse runs the fastest on the road.
2.272.14	They run in the same manner.
2.272.15	Therefore the running horse catches up with the road.
2.272.16	There is one step that is equal.
2.272.17	Therefore the horse stands with one foot pointing north.
2.273.1	There are four outer Praushtas.
2.273.2	Horses have four feet and four hoofs.
2.273.3	Those animals that have four feet and hoofs, he wins them by this.
2.273.4	There are eight kinds of butter in each (verse).
2.273.5	Animals have eight hoofs.
2.273.6	Those who are the eight-footed animals, he wins them by this.
2.273.7	The midday (rite) is twelvefold.
2.273.8	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
2.273.9	Animals are Jagati.
2.273.10	What is small among animals, that is Jagati.
2.273.11	He wins that very thing by this.
2.273.12	Saviman is the morning Pavamana.
2.273.13	These two are the two sets of ten in Viraj, namely twenty.
2.273.14	The animals of the king are the twenty-one.
2.273.15	Those animals of the king who are the twenty-ones, he wins them by this (rite).
2.273.16	Then the twenty-fourth Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
2.273.17	The animals of the king have four feet.
2.273.18	Those animals who have four feet and are of the king, he wins them with this (rite).
2.273.19	Then the twenty-four half-months are the year. With the year itself he (the sacrificer) takes it.
2.274.1	Having taken it, they offer it on the second day.
2.274.2	This becomes the twenty-first second day, with one Stoma.
2.274.3	Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun is the twenty-first.
2.274.4	Just as the firm Methi is destroyed, so is the Ekavimsa (stoma) of the Stomas.
2.274.5	In it they offer these animals, the elephant as the supreme, the antelope as the inferior.
2.274.6	Having encircled them with fire, they offer some and release others.
2.274.7	Its Prsthastomas are called Mahanama.
2.274.8	For these are not worthy of being offered to the great names.
2.274.9	They have seven steps, for there are seven domestic animals. For the purpose of including domestic animals.
2.274.10	The seventh step is exceeded, for the purpose of including wild animals.
2.274.11	For him there is the Brahma-sāman called Pārturarśma, which is prosperous with the word "atha".
2.274.12	For the horse runs as if saying "atha, atha".
2.274.13	And indeed the wide ray is worthy to lead the horse.
2.274.14	It becomes the Pāṅkta (sāman).
2.274.15	For the Pāṅktam is the Brahma-sama of the Mahānāmni (sāmans).
2.274.16	There are twenty-one sacrificial posts, each with twenty-one jewels.
2.274.17	For they are not worthy of being raised up as many as twenty-one animals.
2.274.18	Six posts are of birch, twelve of Khadira, two of Puşyara, and the king of the Rajjudala is of Puşyāra. The twenty-one posts are of Puşyārā.
2.274.19	He is the Agniṣṭha.
2.274.20	Prajapati is the king of trees, namely, the Rajjuḍāla.
2.274.21	Its fruits are the penis.
2.274.22	And what is mucus is semen.
2.274.23	Prajapti is the father, the sun is the son.
2.274.24	The Atiratra with all Stotras is performed. It is for the conquest and advance of all worlds.
2.274.25	All this is indeed Stoma.
2.274.26	And when we have come to these individual Stomas, having united them, and having established ourselves in them, we shall attain the goal.
2.275.1	Now this is the Govinata Chandoma Pavamana.
2.275.2	One who desires cattle should offer with this.
2.275.3	His Stotras are both odd and even. Those who know that the Stotras are odd, they are the domestic animals, and those who know that the even ones are the wild animals.
2.275.4	The Stotras are indeed animals.
2.275.5	He who knowing thus offers with the Stotras and Pavamana, he indeed obtains both kinds of animals, the domestic and the wild.
2.275.6	Now this is the second day, with the Ekavimsa (Stoma).
2.275.7	It is the same Ekavimsa which has not yet been praised.
2.275.8	This is the same Brahman.
2.275.9	On that day they offer the horse as a victim.
2.275.10	Because this is the Ekavimśa, therefore it is bent towards the cow.
2.275.11	The Trayastrimsa (the thirty-three) is the third day.
2.275.12	The thirty-three are the deities, the thirty-three are heaven.
2.275.13	They ascend them after having attained them at last.
2.275.14	Now as to him who has a fifteenfold Agniṣṭoma, a fifteenfold Ukthya, and a fifteenfold Atiratra.
2.275.15-21	One who desires the Kshatra should offer this sacrifice. The Kshatra is the horse, the Kshatra is fifteen, the Kshattra is the sacrifice. This is done with the same characteristics. With this sacrifice, the bull Yajnatura, the king of the Svetnas, offered a sacrifice desiring sovereignty. And he became the sole sovereign of the Svetnas. One who desires prosperity should offer this sacrifice.
2.275.22	This is the sacrifice of the Kṣatriyas.
2.275.23	He attains prosperity.
2.276.1	Now, he for whom this has three days and five nights, three days and five night, three days and fivenights, should offer this sacrifice if he desires heaven.
2.276.2	And having given (gifts) to the Sūta-manas and Mitravīḍ, Daṃṣṭradyumna, they both became students of the king of Śvetadvīpa, the son of Prati-darśa.
2.276.3	Mitravīḍ performed the duties of a teacher for Daṃṣṭrodyumna.
2.276.4	He protected the cows.
2.276.5	Then he studied the other chapters.
2.276.6	They used to meet in the evening and say to each other, “Bring Soma, we shall place our hands on it.” “Bring Soma, O good-doer, we shall place hands on it.”
2.276.7	Then the teacher gave instructions to Datvā Sutemana.
2.276.8	They met in the evening and said to each other, "Bring the Soma, we shall place our hands on it." "Bring the Soma," he said, "we shall place our hands upon it."
2.276.9	"No," he said.
2.276.10	"I have already let you go, or I am instructed by my teacher."
2.276.11	He spent that night with a feeling of displeasure.
2.276.12	The next day he went after the cows.
2.277.7	He said, "You may speak, having given (the fee). The teacher has instructed you."
2.277.8	"Do you see the path of the gods?"
2.277.9	He said, "No."
2.277.10	"Or do you see it?"
2.277.11	"Tell me about it."
2.277.12	"So be it."
2.277.13	He said to him,
2.277.14	Therefore, a friend of a Brāhmaṇa is indeed more affectionate than a friend of a Kṣatriya.
2.277.15	He said to Sutema, "Do you see the path of the gods? Come, let us go to heaven."
2.278.1	He replied, "No."
2.278.2	"One goes to it either by giving or by exertion."
2.278.3	"Well, shall we give or exert?"
2.278.4	He went for a year with Mitravind and Damantadyumna, with Go and Ayus.
2.278.5	He indeed went to the heavenly world after a year.
2.278.6	Then, having given, Sutemana, having performed this very three-day sacrifice, went to the heavenly worlds.
2.278.7	One indeed goes to the heavenly worlds by performing this very (sacrifice).
2.278.8	By performing this very (three-day sacrifice), Hirannyadan, desiring union, performed a sacrifice.
2.278.9	Whatever is here, cattle, horses, elephants, gold, goats, sheep, barley, rice, sesamum, and beans, that is his wealth.
2.278.10	He who, knowing this, performs the sacrifice with this (verse) for the sake of a pair, has much wealth.
2.279.1	Now this is the internal wealth.
2.279.2	Khāṇḍika Hāudāri and Keśin Dārbhya competed with each other among the Pañcālas.
2.279.3	He, Khāṇḍika, challenged Keśin.
2.279.4	Keśin, being challenged by Khāṇḍikā, went to the king of Kurus, his mother's brother, to Uccaiḥśravas, the horse.
2.279.5	He said to him, "Arrange a sacrifice for me."
2.279.6	He said, "So be it."
2.279.7	"How shall I arrange it for you?"
2.279.8	"As one prospers in this world and as one prospers in the other world."
2.279.9	He said, "As in this (world)."
2.279.10	He said, "Does he ask about the sacrifice who does not know the sacrifice is a companion?"
2.279.11	"How so?"
2.279.12	"Because the sacrifice is for that world, not for this one."
2.279.13	"No," he said.
2.279.14	Khāṇḍikya Vaudāri became angry.
2.279.15	"Do it so that I may overcome him."
2.279.16	Therefore he placed this treasure within.
2.279.17	The Agniṣṭoma is of all stomas.
2.279.18	From here onwards the procedure of the Chandomas is as follows: The morning pressing has twenty-four stomas, the midday pressing thirty-four stomas and the third pressing thirty-eight stomas.
2.279.19	The Atiratra is of all stoma beyond this.
2.279.20	Brahma is twenty-four, Kshatra is thirty-four, and Vid is forty-eight.
2.279.21	The entire Stoma is indeed the year.
2.279.22	Having encompassed this threefold world with these two entire Stomas, he established it within himself.
2.279.23	From that he went to Shri.
2.280.1	Then he expelled Khundika.
2.280.2	Then the one called Kesi becomes the one called Darbha, and the one called Para becomes the one called Khandhika.
2.280.3	One who knows this becomes one who has conquered his enemies through his own self.
2.280.4	One who desires prosperity should offer this sacrifice.
2.280.5	By means of these two sacrifices, one who has conquered all, having encompassed the three worlds, takes them into himself.
2.280.6	One goes to that prosperity.
2.280.7	Now this is the Paraka sacrifice.
2.280.8	One who desires heaven should offer this sacrifice.
2.280.9	His hymns, verses, and praises are all directed towards the distant heaven. Everything becomes directed towards the distant (heaven).
2.280.10	He who is old, the king of Kauravas, offered this sacrifice to Uccaiḥśravas of Kauveyas.
2.280.11	Having offered this sacrifice, he attained heaven.
2.280.12	By performing this sacrifice, one attains heaven.
2.280.13	One who desires brahmic glory should perform this sacrifice, which consists of the Jyotiragniṣṭoma, Jyotiruktha and Jyotiratirātra.
2.280.14	He who attains brahmic glory shines like the light.
2.280.15	By performing this sacrifice, he attains brahmic glory and becomes brahmic.
2.280.16	Now, he who has the Agniṣṭoma with seventeen, the Ukthya with seventeen, and the Atiratra with seventeen, his is the horse sacrifice of Prajapati.
2.280.17	One who desires progeny should offer this sacrifice.
2.280.18	Now, he who has Agniṣṭoma of twenty-one, Ukthya of twenty-one and Atiratra of twenty-one - his is the horse-sacrifice of Aditya.
2.280.19	One who wishes for heaven should offer this sacrifice.
2.281.1	Now these are the four-day sacrifices.
2.281.2	Atri desired, "May four heroes be born to me."
2.281.3	He saw this four-day sacrifice.
2.281.4	He brought it.
2.281.5	He performed it.
2.281.6	Then four heroes were born to him.
2.281.7	Those who know this have four heroes born to them.
2.281.8	The sages of the Atri clan desired, "May four sons be born to us."
2.281.9	They saw this four-day sacrifice.
2.281.10	They performed it.
2.281.11	They offered it.
2.281.12	Then four sons were born to them. Four sons are born to him who knows this.
2.281.13-16	The four-fold union is the union of procreation. One and one, two and two, three and three, four and four, this is the four-fold union of procreation.
2.281.17	And there are twenty-four Pavamāna verses, because the year consists of twenty-four half-months.
2.281.18	"May he generate me."
2.281.19	There are two Sāman verses, Brihat and Rathantara.
2.281.20	This is the divine pair, the generating (pair), that is, Brihat and Rathaantara.
2.282.2	The seasons are odd.
2.282.3	The seasons indeed generate all this.
2.282.4	They who generate all this, may they generate me.
2.282.5	They go forth, abandoning the praise of the day.
2.282.6	They take up the praise of the next day.
2.282.7	The praise is indeed a hero.
2.282.8	They go on, producing that strength day by day, and they take up the strength of each day. They go on, departing with each syllable.
2.282.9-10	The first day has the Agniṣṭoma Sāman with one syllable, the second with two syllables, the third with three syllables, the fourth with four syllables. The hero is the best of syllables. The hero was the best of syllables.
2.282.11	He is not a hero who follows the heroism of another.
2.282.12	He is indeed a hero who follows his own heroism.
2.282.13	And because the Agniṣṭoma Sāmans are different, it is for the sake of the different heroism of heroes.
2.283.1	They say that one should perform the Yajñāyajñiya Sāman at each Agniṣṭoma.
2.283.2	The Jyeṣṭhya is the Yajñāyajñiya.
2.283.3	"The hero does not fall from the Jyeṣṭhyā."
2.283.4	If the Stotras were to be the same, then they would attain the same kind of strength.
2.283.5	If they were different, then they would have the strength in the Jyeṣthyas alone.
2.283.6	If the Pavamānas are the same, then one attains the same kind of power.
2.283.7	Now when they proceed with the later Stotras, they proceed with greater strength in the superior ones.
2.283.8	This indeed is a two-day sacrifice.
2.283.9	In the third day, they should perform the Rathantara as the Prstha in the two Stotras beginning with "O Agni, do thou, O Agni, O Agni, do thou" and ending with "O Agni do thou, O Indra, do thou, do thou."
2.283.10	That which is the verse, "O Agni, thou art the most excellent of all," by that verse they do not go beyond the form of the Rathantara.
2.283.11	The third day is extended with the Gayatri metre.
2.283.12	"Who is that Indra, O Indra, with the Vasus?" is the Maitravaruna-sastra.
2.283.13	These syllables are completed here.
2.283.14	Those which are Gayatri, those which are Kakubha, those which are Brihat, those which are Anushtubha, those which
2.283.15	The desires are yoked according to the place.
2.283.16	The first day is extended with the Gāyatrī, the second with the Tristubh, the third with the Jagatī, and the fourth with the Anushtubh.
2.283.17	They should perform the Brihat Sāman on the fourth day with the verse "We invoke you in sacrifices."
2.283.18	Because of the word "you" in that verse, they do not go beyond the form of the Brihat.
2.283.19	The fourth day is extended with the Anushtubh metre.
2.283.20	"We have come to you, O new one," is the Maitrāvaruṇa Sāman.
2.283.21	The syllables of these are completed here.
2.283.22	Those which are Gāyatrī, those which are Kakubha, those which are Bṛhatī, those which are Paṅktyā, those which are Śākinī, those which
2.283.23	The metres are yoked in their respective places.
2.284.1	The Agniṣṭoma is the first day, the Ukthya the second, the Ṣoḍaśī the third, and the Atiratra the fourth.
2.284.2	The days have different powers, for the sake of the different powers of the heroes.
2.284.3	Now, indeed, Taksaka Bāgārathi, the Matsyan king, said: "The Catuṣṭoma (sacrifice) covers the Prsthya (stotras).
2.284.4	The two days are performed with the Brihat and Rathantara tunes.
2.284.5	They should perform the Vaivarupa and Mahanama on the third day.
2.284.6	They are Rathantara.
2.284.7	The third day is Rathantara.
2.284.8	They should perforin the Vaimata and Revati on the fourth day.
2.284.9	They belong to the Bharata.
2.284.10	The fourth day is Bharata.
2.284.11	Thus, indeed, the four-day sacrifice pervades the (three) days. So he said.
2.284.12	They say: Which is the most excellent of the sacrifices? Which is the best?
2.284.13	He should say: The three-day sacrifice is the most excellent.
2.284.14	These worlds are the three-day sacrifice, and the four-day is the directions.
2.285.1	Now this is the Jamadagni (sacrifice).
2.285.2	One who desires progeny should offer this sacrifice.
2.285.3	Jamadagni desired, 'May I beget many offspring and cattle.'
2.285.4	He saw this four-day sacrifice.
2.285.5	He brought it.
2.285.6	He performed it.
2.285.7	Then he begot many offspring and cattle.
2.285.8	Even his two sons, Aurva, did not know each other, saying, 'Who are you? Who are you?'
2.285.9	Thus many are born here.
2.285.10	Therefore, even now, when two gray-haired Aurvas come together, they do not recognize each other.
2.285.11	One who knows this is born with many offspring and cattle.
2.285.12	They say that the consecration should last for a year.
2.285.13	The year is indeed procreation.
2.285.14	This sacrifice is procreation.
2.285.15	That procreation is performed.
2.285.16	Therefore, one who desires progeny should offer this sacrifice.
2.285.17	Some say that there should be forty-eight (syllables).
2.285.18	The Jagati has forty-eight syllables.
2.285.19	Jagati is cattle.
2.285.20	This sacrifice is Jagati.
2.285.21	Therefore, one who desires cattle should offer this sacrifice with it.
2.285.22	Some say there should be thirty-six (syllables),
2.285.23	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
2.285.24	The Brihatī indeed brought the heavenly world.
2.285.25	That is indeed his heavenly (world).
2.285.26	Therefore, indeed, one who desires heaven should sacrifice with it.
2.285.27	Those three are the Jagatī verses.
2.285.28	There are three Jagatī verses in the foot.
2.285.29	They do not go beyond the form of the Jagatī.
2.285.30	Some say, "There should be twenty-four only."
2.285.31	The year, consisting of twenty-four and a half months, is the procreation.
2.285.32	This sacrifice is procreation.
2.285.33	That procreation is performed.
2.285.34	Therefore one who desires procreation should offer sacrifice with it.
2.285.35	That becomes the single Jāgata (verse).
2.285.36	They do not go beyond the forms of the Jāgati (verse).
2.286.1	They say, "The first day is performed with the Gāyatrī, the second with the Tristubh, the third with the Jagatī, and the fourth with the Anushtubh. But why is this sacrifice called Jagatī?"
2.286.2	He would say, "When Bahvashva and Bahvashvatarika, knowing the others, come to us, they come in this way, each verse of the Jagati ascending to another verse of the Jagatī."
2.286.3	And because these Stotras, having been chanted, approach the Jagatī, therefore it is called Jagatī.
2.286.4	And the Jagatī is the most eminent of the metres.
2.286.5	Therefore, they call the Grhyas (the Grhyas) by the name of the Jyeṣṭhas. He who knows this, he sees the Grhyas.
2.286.6	Indeed, this is a two-day sacrifice, namely, the one with the Brihat and Rathantara (Samans). In the third day of this, they should perform the Rathantara Sāman.
2.286.7	In that it is said, "To you, O bull, the Soma has been pressed," by that they do not go beyond the form of the Rathantara.
2.286.8	The third day is extended by the Gayatri metre.
2.286.9	"The Maitravaruna-saman is sung with the verse, "Who is that Indra, the protector?"
2.286.10	The verses of these (saman) are completed here.
2.286.11	"We invoke thee at sacrifices," they should sing the Brihat-saman on the fourth day.
2.286.12	"That thou art," by this (verse) they do not go beyond the form of Brihat.
2.286.13	The fourth day is extended by the Anushtubh metre.
2.286.14	"We have come to you, O new one," is the Maitrāvaruṇa Sāman.
2.286.15	The syllables of these are completed here.
2.287.1	Indeed, this four-day (rite) is extended in the Chanda.
2.287.2	The Brihatī is the first among the Prstha (stotras), the Gāyatrī is the second, the Uṣṇīṣa is the first among those of the Ārbhava, and the Anushtubha is the second.
2.287.3	Now, when these (verses) are composed in a mixed manner, it is because the offspring and cattle are born from a mixed union.
2.287.4	And man is indeed mixed with sins.
2.287.5	By means of these mixed verses he removes the mixed sins.
2.287.6	They say, what is the sequence of the four-day (rite)?
2.287.7	One should say, "Day and night."
2.287.8	Day and night are indeed the four nights.
2.287.9	One covers the day with the first day, the second day covers the day's sign, the third day covers the night, and the fourth day covers the sign of the morning day.
2.287.10	Day and night indeed generate everything here.
2.287.11	Those who generate all this, may they generate me.
2.287.12	One should say, 'The four directions are the four nights.'
2.287.13	There are four directions.
2.287.14	The fifth direction is above.
2.287.15	These are the four days.
2.287.16	The fifth is the night.
2.287.17	By this one attains the directions.
2.287.18	Having established oneself in the directions, one goes to the heavenly world.
2.287.19	These are the oblations of the Puronuvākyā.
2.287.20	The Puronuvāka is the womb, the ghee is the semen.
2.287.21	When one offers the Puronuvākya and then offers the ghee, one establishes the semen in the womb.
2.287.22	If one knows this, the semen that has been deposited becomes fruitful.
2.287.23	Now, indeed, he offers oblations to those very deities. He prospers in them.
2.287.24	Having established himself in them, he goes to the heavenly world.
2.288.1	Now, this is the Prajapati-rite.
2.288.2	One who desires progeny should offer this sacrifice.
2.288.3	Prajapati desired, 'May I beget many offspring and cattle.'
2.288.4	He saw this four-day (rite) and brought it.
2.288.5	He performed it.
2.288.6	For him there are Trivṛt, Pañcadaśa, Saptadaśa and Ekavimśa stomas.
2.288.7	The deficient and excessive ones are the begetting ones.
2.288.8	One is deficient, the other is excessive.
2.288.9	From the deficient and excessive ones, offspring and cattle are born.
2.288.10	The Trivṛt and Pañcadaśa are the pair, the begetting.
2.288.11	The Saptadaśa and Ekavimśa are the begetting pair. May that beget me.
2.288.12	From that he became many with offspring and cattle.
2.288.13	He who knows this becomes many with offspring and animals.
2.288.14	Then they say, "When the created beings were created, he was afraid of their destruction."
2.288.15	He saw this four-day sacrifice.
2.288.16	He brought it.
2.288.17	He performed it.
2.288.18	The Agniṣṭoma and Ukthya are at the beginning and end, with the Atirātra in the middle.
2.288.19	The Agniṣṭoma is Brahman, the Ukthyas are progeny and cattle. Thus he encloses both progeny and cattle on both sides for protection.
2.288.20	He whose knowledge is thus, his wealth is not taken away by others.
2.289.1	Now this is Vasiṣṭha's creeping.
2.289.2	Vasiṣṭha desired, "May I creep over these worlds."
2.289.3	He saw this four-day sacrifice.
2.289.4	He brought it.
2.289.5	He performed it.
2.289.6	Then he conquered these worlds.
2.289.7	That he conquered these worlds, that is the reason for the name of Sansarpa.
2.289.8	He conquers these worlds, he who knows thus.
2.289.9	Its three-three stomas are yoked and carry the day.
2.289.10	The three are the best of the yoked.
2.289.11	One goes to where one wishes to go by means of the yoked (horse).
2.289.12	Some say, "One should offer this sacrifice only if one desires offspring." One becomes united with the Stoma through this.
2.289.13	From the union of the two, offspring and cattle are born. It is for procreation.
2.289.14	They go on giving up the praise of the day by day. They take up the praise of day by day.
2.290.1	Now this is Gautama's four-stoma.
2.290.2	They did not have faith in Gautama.
2.290.3	The royal sage was not worthy of faith.
2.290.4	He desired, "May they have faith in me. May I be worthy of faith."
2.290.5-12	He saw this four-day sacrifice. He brought it. He performed it. Then they had faith in him, he became worthy of faith. He who knows this becomes worthy of faith. He is indeed the one who has performed the Stoma. Faith is indeed the one performed. Whatever is won by doing and taken by faith, it is taken by faith.
2.290.13	Therefore, he is praised.
2.290.14	He is indeed the one who has gone to the heaven of the Angirasas by crossing four.
2.290.15	The Adityas went to heaven by crossing two, and the Angirasas went to heaven crossing four.
2.290.16	He who knows this goes to heaven crossing four (stages).
2.290.17	They say, "The sacrifice is a falling away, the lord is the one who goes to this world before his life is over."
2.290.18	And in that the praises are in descending order, therefore it is not lost, therefore it is life-giving.
2.290.19	Now this is the All-Light.
2.290.20	The gods desired, "May we be like all light."
2.290.21	They saw this four-day sacrifice.
2.290.22	They brought it and performed it.
2.290.23	Then indeed they became like all light.
2.290.24	Therefore, they say that even now they see the light of the gods as if in a mirror.
2.290.25	One who desires brahmic splendor should offer this sacrifice.
2.290.26	He who attains brahmic splendor shines like light.
2.290.27	One attains brahmic splendor through this, and becomes one who has brahmic splendor.
2.291.1	Now, these are the five-day rites.
2.291.2-8	There are five victories. The gods conquered with the five Vyāhṛtis. They conquered as much as the gods conquered. The sacrifice is fivefold. They conquer as much as the measure of the sacrifice. Animals are fivefold. As much as the measure is of animals, they conquer so much. Animals are not excluded from the sacrifice.
2.291.9	The five-day rite is for food.
2.291.10	The five-day rite, which is for food, is for the one who stands up with as much food as there is.
2.291.11	These are the five days.
2.291.12	The year has five seasons.
2.291.13	The year is Prajapati, the sacrifice.
2.291.14	By this one attains Prajapati, sacrifice, the year.
2.291.15	The gods and the demons competed.
2.291.16	They did not conquer by means of sticks and arrows.
2.291.17	They said, "We do not conquer by means means of sticks and arrow.
2.291.18	O Brahman, may we conquer by means of speech alone."
2.291.19	They thought, "Those who will speak first to us, they will be conquered by us."
2.291.20	The gods said to the Asuras, "You speak first."
2.291.21	"You are indeed!" said the Asuras to the gods.
2.291.22	The gods saw this pair of words:
2.292.1	"One is ours!" said the gods. "One is ours!" the Asuras.
2.292.2	The gods said, "Mind!" The Asuras said, "Speech!"
2.292.3	The gods, by means of the mind, took away the speech of the Asuras.
2.292.4	Therefore, whatever one attains by means of the intellect, one speaks by means of speech.
2.292.5	The gods said, "We have two," and the Asuras said, "We also have two."
2.292.6	The gods said the two breaths, and the Asuras the day and night.
2.292.7	The gods won the Asuras by means of the Prāṇa and Apāna.
2.292.8	Therefore, one who lives long, passes many days and nights.
2.292.9	The gods said, "Ours are three." The Asuras said, "Ours too are three."
2.292.10	The gods said these three worlds. The Asuras said three sciences.
2.292.11	The gods, with these very worlds, won the three sciences from the Asuras.
2.292.12	Therefore, these sciences are said to be in these very worlds.
2.292.13	The gods said, "We have four." The Asuras said, "We also have four."
2.292.14	The gods said that animals have four feet, and the Asuras said that there are four directions.
2.292.15	The gods, with the four-footed animals, conquered the four directions from the Asuras.
2.292.16	Therefore, when one brings an animal from any direction, he follows it as conquered, established, and settled.
2.292.17	"The five are ours," said the gods to the seasons.
2.292.18	Then the Asuras did not succeed.
2.292.19	There is nothing at all that is five.
2.292.20	Those Asuras, finding no beginning, saying "five, five" only, were defeated.
2.292.21	Then indeed the gods became victorious, the Asuras defeated.
2.292.22	One becomes victorious over oneself, one's enemy becomes defeated, one who knows this.
2.293.1	These are the victorious Vyahrtis.
2.293.2	Victory is the five-day (rite).
2.293.3	He who knows this, he conquers, he conquers.
2.293.4-8	This is the only victory over all, the only defeat of all. By this the gods conquered the Asuras. The Asuras were defeated by all. He who knows this conquers his enemy by all, and his enemy is defeated by all. Then these become continuous.
2.293.9	Just as wood is bound together by a yoke, so the five-day (Stoma) is bound together by the Stomas.
2.293.10	The Stomas are indeed the breaths.
2.293.11	A man is bound together by his breaths.
2.293.12	He who knows this is indeed bound together.
2.293.13	Two Stomas are yoked together and carry the day.
2.293.14	Two are the best yoked ones.
2.293.15	He goes there by the proper means, to where he desires to go.
2.294.1	Now, as for this three-day rite of light, cattle, and life, the twenty-fifth day, the Great Vrata, the Atiratra with all Stotras, one who desires food should offer it.
2.294.2	They say, "One should not undertake the Great Vrata before a year."
2.294.3	Now, the three-day sacrifice called Jyotiḥ, Gauḥ, Āyuḥ is performed. This world is Jyotiḥ, this world is Gauḥ, that world is Āyuḥ.
2.294.4	These worlds are the seasons, the year.
2.294.5	The seasons and the year cook the entire food offering. They obtain the food offering won by the year.
2.294.6	The twenty-five-fold Mahavrata sacrifice is performed. Food is twenty-five-folded. For the attainment of food.
2.294.7	The Atiratra sacrifice with all Stotras is performed. For the conquest and advance of all worlds.
2.294.8	All this is indeed Stotras.
2.294.9	Then, having performed the rites of the three days, we shall perform the rites of the four days.
2.294.10	Then, if one performs the rites of the Trivṛt, Pañcadaśa, Saptadaśa, Pañviṃśa, Mahāvrata, Sarvastomātirātra, one who desires food should perform this.
2.294.11	They say that one should not undertake the Great Vrata before a year.
2.294.12	That it is three-fold, fifteen-fold, seventeen-fold, it becomes a three-day rite. This world is three-fold; this is fifteen-fold; that is seventeen-fold.
2.294.13	These worlds are the seasons; the year is the seasons.
2.294.14	The seasons cook the entire food-offering. They obtain the food-offering won by the year.
2.294.15	The Mahavrata sacrifice is of twenty-five (Stoma). Food is of twenty- five. For the attainment of food.
2.294.16	The Atiratra sacrifice is of all (Stoma). For the attainment and conquest of all worlds.
2.294.17	All this is indeed the Stoma.
2.294.18	And when we have come to these individual Stomas, having united them, having established ourselves in them, we shall eat together.
2.295.1	Now, he who desires that his Mahāvrata should be accompanied by the Paroksa should offer this sacrifice.
2.295.2	Since it is the twenty-fourth day, his Mahāvrta becomes accompanied by the Parokṣa.
2.295.3	Whatever is the invocation, the introduction, or the response, it is by that alone that he attains the twenty-five.
2.295.4	The Atiratra with all Stotras takes place. For the conquest and advance of all worlds.
2.295.5	For everything here is indeed Stotras.
2.295.6	Then, having united all these Stoma-s, and having established ourselves in them, we shall eat together.
2.295.7	Now, he who has three days, five days, seven days, twenty-four days, the Jyotiṣṭoma and the Atiratra, if one desires that his Mahāvrata should be remote, he should offer this sacrifice.
2.295.8	Since it is the twenty-fourth day, his Mahāvrta becomes remote.
2.295.9	Whatever be the invocation, the invocation, or the response, it is by that alone that he attains the twenty-five.
2.295.10	The Jyotiṣṭoma and the Atiratra are indeed known as the divine path. By the known divine path, the auspicious, we shall attain the auspicious goal.
2.296.1	Now, if the Agniṣṭoma and the Ukthya are performed on either side of this Jyotiṣṭoma, the Goāyuṣī and the Ukthīya are performed in between, and the Jyotiṣṭomātirātra is performed in the middle, one who desires progeny should perform this sacrifice.
2.296.2	This Jyotiṣṭoṃātirātra indeed is the entire sacrifice for progeny.
2.296.3	Progeny is produced from the middle of the self.
2.296.4	Now, the Atiratra sacrifice in the middle is performed; it places the generation in the middle of the self; one becomes many and is born.
2.296.5	The Goayushi and Ukthya are performed in between.
2.296.6	The Ukthas are indeed cattle.
2.296.7	There are five hundred Stotriyas in them.
2.296.8	He thus encloses the progeny on both sides with cattle.
2.296.9-12	The two Jyotiṣṭomas are on either side of the Agniṣṭoma. Brahma is the Jyotiṣṭoma. Thus he encloses his progeny and cattle on both sides with Brahma for their protection.
2.296.13	Now, if the Agniṣṭoma and Ukthya are performed on either side of this Jyotiṣṭoma, then the Goāyuṣī and the Ukthya are in between. The Jyotiṣṭomāgniṣṭoma is in the middle. If one desires, "May my offspring be endowed with brahmic lustre," then one should perform this sacrifice.
2.296.14	Brahmic lustre is indeed brilliance. The Jyotiştoma Agniṣṭoma is brilliance.
2.296.15	The generation of offspring is in the middle of oneself.
2.296.16	Now, in the middle, there is the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice. It is indeed the light in the middle of the self that he bestows. He is born with lustre among his progeny.
2.296.17	The Goāyuṣī and Ukthya are the two in between.
2.296.18	The Ukthas are indeed cattle.
2.296.19	There are five hundred Stotriyas in them.
2.296.20	By means of the animals he takes possession of the progeny on both sides, endowed with brilliance.
2.296.21	The two Jyotiṣṭomas are performed on either side of the two Atiratras.
2.296.22	These two worlds are the two Atiratra sacrifices.
2.296.23	By means of these two worlds he takes possession of progeny and cattle on both sides, for the purpose of obtaining them.
2.296.24	He whose wealth is not taken away by others, knows this.
2.297.1	Now these are the six-day (sacrifices).
2.297.2	The Maruts desired: "May we be the most powerful, the strongest, the most numerous, the most heroic among the gods; may we conquer heaven."
2.297.3	They saw this six-day sacrifice.
2.297.4	They brought it.
2.297.5	They performed it.
2.297.6	Then they became the most powerful, the strongest, the most numerous, and the most heroic among the gods. They conquered the heavenly world.
2.297.7	He who knows this becomes the most powerful, strongest, most numerous, and most heroic among his kinsmen. He conquers the heavenly world. He who knows this.
2.297.8	They proceed with the six-day Prsthya (Sacrifice).
2.297.9	The Prsthya sacrifices are the glory and the strength.
2.297.10-16	The back-parts of the earth are indeed the back-parts of prosperity. The back-parts are indeed strength and valour. They go with strength and valour. The back-parts are the heavenly world. They go, ascending the heavenly world. The initiation is in the bathing with Sarasvati. They are initiated on the southern bank.
2.298.1	The sacrificial post is the mortar and pestle of the sacrificial post. It is the post that has been raised for the sake of non-deterioration.
2.298.2	For those who do so, there is no deterioration.
2.298.3	They go to the Shamiaparasa.
2.298.4	These are the steps of the heavenly world, namely, the Shamiaparasas.
2.298.5	They go, stepping on the steps of the heaven.
2.298.6-14	They go, striking and shouting. This is the form of strength, that which is struck and shouted at. They go to Sarasvati. Sarasvati is speech. The path of the gods is speech. They go by that very path of the gods. They go in the opposite direction. The heavenly world is indeed like the opposite direction. They go in the opposite direction. They attain that very heavenly world.
2.298.15	They go to the east and north.
2.298.16	The heaven world is indeed like the east and north
2.298.17	They go to the heaven world, ascending it.
2.298.18	They go to Prakshat and Prasravan.
2.298.19	This indeed is the end of speech, namely Prakshat and Prastravan.
2.298.20	Where indeed is the end (of speech), that is the heaven world.
2.298.21	They go indeed to the heaven world.
2.299.1	Then indeed, by this (rite) the Maruts, when Indra and Agni looked at them, they thought: "If they complete this (rite), then the Maruts will be everything here."
2.299.2	They won a thousand in the Sattr-pariveṣaṇa.
2.299.3	They made it their own.
2.299.4	They made their sin their own.
2.299.5	Therefore, one should not desire to be like Vimāthya, lest one be deprived of sin.
2.299.6	Of those two, the wise ones chose the one who stood up, saying, "I am not afraid."
2.299.7	Those who chose the one who was afraid, they became the ones who are afraid.
2.299.8	Of those who chose the one not afraid, these are their goals: when they accomplish something, that is one goal.
2.299.9	When one of them dies, that is one.
2.299.10	When ten cows become a hundred, that is one.
2.299.11	The hundred cows are one thousand.
2.299.12	By this very thing, the ancient householders of Sthūra
2.299.13	having risen up against the Trikṛtas, the Salvas, and the Vyādhinis, conquered them.
2.299.14	They killed their householder.
2.299.15	Those who were grieving over the death of that householder Hemagṛhapati sat around him.
2.299.16	Then Dhruva-Gopas, with the help of Saṅkāśin, pursued him and caught him.
2.299.17	He ascended to heaven from the Āhavaniya fire.
2.299.18	He said, "Do not be sorry for me."
2.299.19	"He who you are sorry for, he has ascended to heaven from Āhavaniya."
2.299.20	Those who killed them went to heaven.
2.299.21	Those who remained are now the most prosperous of the prosperous.
2.299.22	They were the most sinful of the sinful in those days.
2.299.23	Therefore, they say that prosperity is the result of the defeat of the enemy.
2.300.1	Now, when the two Atiratras of Visvajit and Abhijit are performed on either side, and the four Ukthyas in the middle are called 'Cow is life, cow is life', then those who desire cattle should perform them.
2.300.2	This world is Abhijit, that world is Visvajit.
2.300.3	Then these four Ukthyas are performed in the middle.
2.300.4	The Ukthyas are indeed cattle.
2.300.5	Among them, the Stotriyas are a thousand.
2.300.6	And with this world and that, he thus encloses these animals on both sides, and binds them.
2.300.7	They become owners of many animals.
2.300.8	With this, indeed, Indra and Agni, together with the Maruts, conquered a thousand.
2.300.9	Agni is the conqueror of the battle, Indra the conqueror of all.
2.300.10	And these four are the middle Utkhyas.
2.300.11	The Upavasatha is the animals.
2.300.12	Of them, a thousand are the Stotriyas.
2.300.13	For this is what Indra and Agni took away, having surrounded it on both sides with a thousand.
2.300.14	And indeed, those animals which know this, stand around him on both sides, by these two worlds and by Indra and Agni.
2.300.15	They go to the middle of Kurukshetra, to the place called Parinad. That is the place for consecration.
2.300.16	They go to Kurukshetra facing east.
2.300.17	This is indeed the divine sacrifice of the gods, namely Kurukshetra.
2.300.18	They go there by means of the divine sacrifice of gods.
2.300.19	Their ablution is in Yamuna.
2.300.20	This indeed is the heavenly world, namely Yamuna.
2.300.21	They go to that very heaven.
2.300.22	Now, he for whom this is the third day above and the third day below, if he desires, 'May I go to heaven and stand in this world,' he should offer this sacrifice.
2.300.23	By the three days he goes to heaven above and by the three days below he descends.
2.301.5	Speech is the lordship of speech.
2.301.6	Therefore one performs the sacrifice for seven nights.
2.301.7	There are seven vital airs.
2.301.8	Through the vital airs, offspring and cattle are held and stand up.
2.301.9	Those by whom offspring and cattle are taken up and stand up, may those vital airs take up and stand up with offspring and cattle.
2.301.10	The gods went to the heavenly world by means of the vital airs.
2.301.11	Those vital airs by which the gods went to the heaven, by those vital airs we have gone to the heaven.
2.301.12	There are seven principal vital airs.
2.301.13	These are the vital airs that are free from sin, which are the principal ones.
2.301.14	They are the vital airs which are free from sin. By means of their measure we have performed the sacrifice.
2.301.15	The seven sages, desiring prosperity, practised austerities.
2.301.16	They saw this sacrifice lasting for seven nights.
2.301.17	They brought it.
2.301.18	They performed it.
2.302.1	They became the owners of the days.
2.302.2	Then one of them prospered in one day, another in one day, and still another in one day.
2.302.3	That indeed is the most excellent of the worlds, the most meritorious of the worlds, by which the seven sages have attained success.
2.302.4	"That which is the most excellent, the most meritorious, by which the sages have attained success, one attains success by that."
2.302.5	Therefore one performs the sacrifice for seven nights.
2.302.6	These are the seven days, the seven Stotras.
2.302.7	The Stoma indeed carries the day, the Stoma carries the day, it carries the day.
2.302.8	Indeed, that is the prosperity of the days, that they carry the Stomas in different ways.
2.302.9	That prosperity of the days is indeed done.
2.302.10	They all become twenty-one, the Trivrt and the Trayastrimsa, those two are twenty-one, and the Pañcadaśa and the Trinava, those two are also twenty-one, then the Saptadaśa and the Pañcavimśa, those two are again twenty-one, only the Ekavimśa is twenty-one.
2.302.11	The twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and this sun are twenty-one.
2.302.12	Those who sacrifice for seven nights go to the same world as this.
2.302.13	He who has attained this world prospers.
2.302.14	He who knows this goes to this world and attains the same world as it.
2.303.1	Janaka of Videha performed a sacrifice with this.
2.303.2	The Brahmanas of Kuru and Pancala used to say to him, "We shall perform the sacrifice with you as our priest."
2.303.3	He replied, "No."
2.303.4	"There was no Brahman among you who was more learned than he who created this sacrificial rite for me."
2.303.5	"Let him perform the sacrifice for me."
2.303.6	They said, "So be it."
2.303.7	They indeed made him perform the sacrifice.
2.303.8	This indeed is the six-day Pañcavimśa Mahavrata.
2.303.9	They perform the night rite from there itself.
2.303.10	The Prastara (s) are indeed prosperity and the back (s).
2.303.11	One thus ascends prosperity and the back.
2.303.12	The Mahavrata is indeed food. For the attainment of food.
2.303.13	They say, one should not undertake the Mahāvrata before a year.
2.303.14	Now, when it is a six-day Pañcadaśa, the Pañcadaśas are the seasons.
2.303.15	The seasons are the year.
2.303.16	The year cooks the entire food. They obtain the food won by the year.
2.303.17	The Mahavrata is the twenty-fifth. Food is the twenty-five. For the securing of food.
2.304.1	They say, "This is the place of the day and night." The Agniṣṭoma is this day.
2.304.2	They say this, "This Agniṣṭoma indeed is the year."
2.304.3	The year is Prajapati.
2.304.4	The Prajapati-rite is the great vow itself. The hymns of the Agniṣṭoma Sāman should be of twenty-five verses.
2.304.5	Then they should descend to the night with twenty-one Ukthyas.
2.304.6	Thus indeed, these two sacrificial rites are proclaimed.
2.304.7	Now, in the case of this six-day Sattra, where the Stotras are performed on the fifth day, the Mahāvrata, the Viśvajit, the Sarvapṛṣṭha and the Atiratra, it was by this sacrifice that the king Kārīra, desiring prosperity and food, performed.
2.304.8	The six-day Sattras is the Self, the Mahā-vrata is food.
2.304.9-13	"He will be the best of those who eat food, and will be the best among those who eat food." Then the six-day Sattra is the year. "He thought, "I will be honoured with the year, and will be honoured with food." The Vishvajit is the last day of the Sattra. The Vishva-jit is the last of the Sattras. The Vishvajits are the last of the Vishva-jits.
2.304.14	He thought, "I will step over the back of the goddess of wealth."
2.304.15	Then a brahmin said to him, "As long as he lives, he will be the best among his own people, but he will be headless."
2.304.16	The great vow is indeed the head of the sacrifice.
2.304.17	Just as if one were to cut off the head and join it to the shoulders, it would not stick together. He said, "It is like that."
2.304.18	Those who cut off his head knew it.
2.304.19	And that was just as it was.
2.304.20	As long as the sacrificer Kārīrādi lived, he was the best among his own people.
2.304.21	But he died with his head cut off.
2.305.2	His first day is seventeenfold, then three-fold, then fifteen-fold, then twenty-one-fold, then nine-fold, then thirty-three-fold, then the Jyotiṣṭoma Atiratra.
2.305.3	He who desires prosperity and food should offer with this (rite).
2.305.4	The six-day (rite) is the self, they say.
2.305.5	The three-fold (rite) is (the rite) for the face, the fifteen-fold (rite is the rite) for food.
2.305.6	He will first eat food from the mouth. He will be the best eater of food among his own people."
2.305.7	"Then he thought, "The six-day Sattra is indeed a year. I will be able to obtain food before the year."
2.305.8	The Jyotiṣṭoma Atiratra is performed.
2.305.9	This is indeed the known divine path, namely the Jyotiṣṭomātirātra.
2.305.10	He said, "I shall go to the heaven of the gods by the well-known path of the gods, the path of the righteous." His own disciple followed him.
2.306.1	"Govarṇa, the son of Khālata, will be worse."
2.306.2	Even at the beginning, food was offered from the mouth.
2.306.3	When the food reaches the mouth, then it becomes pure. If one vomits, it becomes pure. When one spits, it becomes pure, thinking, "The food has become impure."
2.306.4	But it became as it was before.
2.306.5	He became worse.
2.306.6	They said to him, "This your own student, Govärna, the son of Khālata, has criticized you."
2.306.7	He said to him, "You should perform this sacrifice for me."
2.306.8	He said, "Yes."
2.306.9	"Just as one would repair a chariot or a cart, so I will repair you."
2.306.10	He made the first day three-fold, then fifteen-fold, then twenty-one-fold, then nine-fold, then thirty-three-fold, then seventeen-fold, then seven-teen-fold.
2.306.11	Two seventeen-fold days are reversed.
2.306.12	By this (rite) Govarman Khālatateya made his teacher perform the sacrifice.
2.306.13	The self is the six-day Prsthya, food is the seventeen-fold.
2.306.14	He will ascend to the food above himself.
2.306.15	That food above you will be enclosed and will be placed in the seventeen, the food above the food.
2.306.16	He said, "May your food be known."
2.307.1	These are the Babaraya in Kuru, the Panayya.
2.307.2	When he was serving at the sacrifice of the gods, he said, "This one sacrificed, this one did not sacrifice."
2.307.3	Now, he who desires to go to the heaven, to the cow, to the life, should offer this sacrifice of three days, the Viśvajit, the Upavasatha, the Sāmnidhā, the Pañcadaśa, the Sāman, the Upabarhaṇa, the Upakalana, the Upaśānta, the Upabhṛt, the Upabṛt, the Sāmans, the Upagraha, the Upaghāta, the Upagama, the Upakrama, the Upaplava, the Upapluta, the Uparātra, the Uparatra, the Uparudra, the Uparudrā, the Uparuddha, the Uparūḍha, the Upariṣṭa, the Uparīṣṭa, and the Uparīṭa. He who desires to go up to the heaven, up to the cow, up to the life, he should offer this sacrifice. He who wishes to go up to heaven, to the Cow, to Life, should offer this three-day sacrifice, the Viśvajiti, the Upavāsa, the Sāmindhā, the Pañca-daśa, the Sama, the Upa-barhaṇa, Upa-kalana, Upa-śānta, Upa-bhṛt, Upa-bṛt, Sāmans, Upa-graha, Upa-ghāta, Upa-gama, Upa-krama, Upa-plava, Upa-pluta, Upa -rātra, Upa-rātra, Uparudra, Uparudrāḥ, Uparuddhaḥ, Uparūḍhāḥ, U
2.307.4	Having approached the Abhijit, having approached the Prishtha, having approached the Chandomas, one approaches the Mahavrata. Food is the Mahavrata, for the securing of food.
2.307.5	They say, "One should not approach the Mahavrata before a year."
2.307.6	That it is a six-day Prishthya sacrifice, the Prishthas are the seasons.
2.307.7	The seasons are the year.
2.307.8	The year cooks the entire food-offering. They obtain the food-offering won by the year.
2.307.9	The Mahavrata sacrifice is of twenty-five (saman verses). Food is of twenty- five. For the obtaining of food.
2.307.10	The Jyotiratiratra (sacrifice).
2.307.11	This indeed is the known divine path, namely, the Jyotiratirātra.
2.307.12	The Devatirtha, which is well-known, is without evil, and one attains the goal without evil.
2.308.1	The seven-day sacrifice has six days as the Pratiṣṭhīya, and the seventh day has twenty-four verses in the Bahispavamāna, thirty-three verses in the Uttara Stotras, twenty-five verses in the Mahāvrata, and thirty-four verses in Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
2.308.2	The sacrifice is indeed obtained as if it were obtained, for this is the six-day sacrifice of the Prsthya.
2.308.3	The reason why the Bahispavamāna is twenty-four verses on the seventh day is that the year consists of twenty-four half-months.
2.308.4	The sacrifice is indeed the year, and they begin the sacrifice with the sacrifice.
2.308.5	And the Gāyatrī consists of twenty- four syllables.
2.308.6	The Gāyatrī verses again make the sacrifice complete.
2.308.7	For by it alone the other Gāyatrī verse is able to make the sacrifice complete again.
2.308.8	The northern Stotras are thirty-three, for the thirty-three gods.
2.308.9	The Mahāvrata is twenty-five, for food is twenty-five.
2.308.10	The Agniṣṭoma Sāman is the thirty-fourth.
2.308.11	The thirty-three are the deities.
2.308.12	Prajapati is the thirty-forth.
2.308.13	Thus he finds support in the deities, including Prajapati, at the end of the sacrifice.
2.308.14	The seventh day is the Sāman of the Agnistoma.
2.308.15	The sacrifice is as if it were being filled up when it is the Pañcahas, the sixth day.
2.308.16	Now, the reason why there are twenty-four Pavamāna verses in the seventh pressing is that the sacrifice has been begun at the beginning of the pressing.
2.308.17	The Trayastrimsa (verse) is repeated again. The Trayastrimsa is the thirty-three deities. It is for attaining the deities.
2.308.18	The Mahavrata (verse) is the twenty-five. The twenty-five is food. It is for the attainment of food.
2.308.19	The Agniṣṭoma Sāman is the thirty-fourth.
2.308.20	The thirty-three are the deities.
2.308.21	Prajapati is the thirty-forth.
2.308.22	Thus he finds support in the deities, including Prajapati, at the end of the sacrifice.
2.309.1	The seventh day is the entire twenty-four, twenty-five, Mahāvrata and thirty-four Agnistoma Sāman.
2.309.2	The sacrifice is indeed accomplished as this is the sixth day of the Prsthya. It is accomplished as the seventh day.
2.309.3	Now, the seventh day is entirely twenty-four (in number). The sacrifice was begun with the entire day.
2.309.4	The twenty-fifth day is the Mahāvrata. The twenty-fifth is food. For the attainment of food.
2.309.5	The thirty-fourth is the Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
2.309.6	There are thirty-three deities.
2.309.7	Prajapati is the thirty-fourth.
2.309.8	In this way, the sacrifice comes to rest in the deities including Prajapati.
2.309.9	The seven-day sacrifice is the same as the six-day sacrifice. The seventh day has the Chandomas and Pavamana hymns, the thirty-fourth, the return to the twenty-fifth, the Mahavrata, the thirty-third, and the Agnistoma Saman.
2.309.10	He who, having approached, desires to approach the Prsthas, the Chandomas, and the Mahavrata, should offer this sacrifice.
2.309.11	Having approached, he approaches the Prsthas and the Chandomas and the Mahavratas. Food is the Mahavrata. It is for the attainment of food.
2.309.12	The thirty-four is again to be repeated.
2.309.13	There are thirty-three deities.
2.309.14	Prajapati is the thirty-fourth.
2.309.15	He thus stands firm in the deities including Prajapati.
2.309.16	The twenty-five-fold is the great vow. The twenty-five is food. For the securing of food.
2.309.17	The thirty-three is the Agniṣṭoma Sāman. The thirty-three are the deities. For the attainment of the deities.
2.310.1	Now these two are connected.
2.310.2	Jamadagni was the priest of the Mahenanas.
2.310.3	He robbed them of their wealth.
2.310.4	They then attacked him.
2.310.5	He thought, "How can I kill seven of each of the seven kinds of domestic animals in one day?"
2.310.6	He saw these two sacrifices.
2.310.7	He performed them.
2.310.8	He performed sacrifices with them.
2.310.9	Then he killed seven by seven of the domestic animals.
2.310.10	This indeed is the unbroken thunderbolt.
2.310.11	He indeed makes them advance with this unbroken thunderbolt.
2.310.12	Just as one would thresh sesame seeds with a pestle, so does he thresh them with this pestle, and then he winnows them.
2.310.13	One who has an enemy, one who wants to perform sorcery, one who wants rivalry, should offer these two sacrifices.
2.310.14	With this very flawless thunderbolt he crushes the hateful, sinful enemy.
2.310.15	Some say, one should offer with these (verses) if one desires offspring.
2.310.16	This is a Stoma (verse) connected with a Stoma. From the union of the connected (verses) offspring and cattle are born. It is for the sake of offspring.
2.310.17	Now this seventeenth day is the seventh day.
2.310.18	On that they undertake the Mahāvrata vow.
2.310.19	Prajapati is the seventeenth.
2.310.20	Food is the great vow. They honor Prajapati with food in his own abode.
2.311.1	Now these are the eight-night (rites).
2.311.2	Brihaspati desired, "May I be lustrous and brilliant, may fame go to the gods."
2.311.3	He saw this eight-night sacrifice.
2.311.4	He brought it.
2.311.5	He performed it with it.
2.311.6	Then he became brilliant and lustrous, and his fame went to the gods.
2.311.7	For this is the fame that went to them, that he obtained the office of their priest.
2.311.8	He becomes brilliant and lustrous, his fame goes to the gods, he who knows this.
2.311.9	They also say, "One should offer this sacrifice to one who desires long life."
2.311.10	The Gayatri is indeed the breath.
2.311.11	This sacrifice has been accomplished in the Gāyatrī.
2.311.12	Therefore, one who desires longevity should perform this sacrifice.
2.311.13	Some say that one should perform this sacrifice only if one desires cattle.
2.311.14	The Gāyatrī has eight syllables.
2.311.15	Cattle have eight kinds of hoofs.
2.311.16	Cattle are the Gāyatrīs.
2.311.17	This sacrifice has been accomplished as the Gāyatri.
2.311.18	Therefore, one who desires cattle should perform this sacrifice.
2.311.19	Prajapati desired, 'May I go from this world to the other world.'
2.311.20	He saw this eight-night sacrifice.
2.311.21	He brought it.
2.311.22	He performed it.
2.311.23	Then he went from this world to that other world.
2.311.24	The reason why the eight-day sacrifice is called 'eight-day' is that it leads one from this world to the other world.
2.311.25	He who knows this leads from this world to another world.
2.311.26	They say, what is the connection with the eight-day (sacrifice)?
2.311.27	One should say, 'The directions.'
2.311.28	The eight-day (ritual) is indeed connected with the directions.
2.311.29	There are four directions and four intermediate directions.
2.311.30	The ninth is the upward direction.
2.311.31	These are the eight days, the ninth is the night.
2.311.32	By this one attains the directions, and having attained the directions, one goes to the heavenly world.
2.312.1	Now, he for whom this Agniṣṭoma of the Jyotiṣṭoma is the Pañcadaśa sacrifice, and the Jyotiṣtoma is the Agniṣṭoma, if one desires, 'May I be lustrous and brilliant in this world, may I go to the heavenly world, may I be lustrous and bright in the other world', he should offer this sacrifice.
2.312.2	Now, the Agniṣṭoma is the light in front. Light is indeed brilliance and splendour. The Agniṣṭoma has light. By it he becomes brilliant and resplendent in this world.
2.312.3	The Pañcadaśa is the heaven. The Pañcadaśā is the heaven. By it one goes to heaven.
2.312.4	The Agniṣṭoma sacrifice is performed in the upper world. The Agniṣṭomapurīṣa sacrifice is the light, and the Agniṣṭoma is the light of Brahman-splendour. By it one becomes endowed with Brahman-splendout in the other world.
2.312.5	Now, he who has the Jyotiṣṭoma-Atirātra as the sixth day of the Pañcadaśa-stoma, and the Jyotiṣtoma-Atirāta as the sixth day, and who desires to stand in this world, to go to the heavenly world, and to stand in the other world, should perform this sacrifice.
2.312.6-7	Now, the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice is performed before (the Atiratra sacrifice). The Jyotiṣṭo ma sacrifice is the entire support. By means of that (Jyotiṣṭoma) he stands firm in this world.
2.312.8	The Jyotiṣṭoma-Atirātra comes at the end. This is the complete foundation, the Jyotiṣṭōma-Atirāta. By it he is established in the other world.
2.313.1	Now, he who desires to be lustrous and brilliant in this world, to go to heaven, and to stand in the other world, should offer this sacrifice.
2.313.2	Now, the Agniṣṭoma is the light in front. Light is indeed brilliance and splendour. The Agniṣṭoma has light. By it he becomes brilliant and resplendent in this world.
2.313.3	The Pañcadaśa is the heaven. The Pañcadaśā is the heaven. By it one goes to heaven.
2.313.4	The Jyotiratītra is performed above. This is the complete foundation, namely, the Jyotiratīra. By it one is established in the other world.
2.313.5	Now, he who has the Jyotiṣṭoma-Atirātra as the sixth day of the Pañcadaśa-stoma, and the Jyotiṣtoma as the Agniṣṭoma, and who desires to stand in this world, to go to the heavenly world, and to be lustrous and Brahmanic in the other world, should perform this sacrifice.
2.313.6-7	Now, the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice is performed before (the Atiratra sacrifice). The Jyotiṣṭo ma sacrifice is the entire support. By means of that (Jyotiṣṭoma) he stands firm in this world.
2.313.8	The Agniṣṭoma with Jyotiṣṭoma as the fifth day is performed above. The Agniṣṭomapurṇamāsa is the light, the Jyotiṣṭomapūrṇamāsa the lustre. By means of this one becomes lustrous and brilliant in the other world.
2.314.1	Now this is the Pañcaviṃśa Mahāvrata with all Stoma and Atiratra.
2.314.2	One who desires food should perform this.
2.314.3	They say, one should not undertake the Mahāvrata before a year.
2.314.4	Now, when it is a six-day Pañcadaśa, the Pañcadaśas are the seasons.
2.314.5	The seasons are the year.
2.314.6	The year cooks the entire food. They obtain the food won by the year.
2.314.7	The twenty-five-fold Mahavrata sacrifice is performed. Food is twenty-five-folded. For the attainment of food.
2.314.8	The Atiratra sacrifice with all Stotras is performed. For the conquest and advance of all worlds.
2.314.9	All this is indeed Stotras.
2.314.10	Then, having performed the Stotras one by one, we shall perform them together and shall attain the goal.
2.314.11	Now, if one desires that his Mahavrata should be performed in a hidden manner, then he should perform this sacrifice. This is the Mahavrata.
2.314.12	Now, when it is the twenty-fourth day, then his Mahāvrata (rite) is completed by that (rite).
2.314.13	Whatever be the Hinkāra, Prāstāra, or Pratihara (rite) there, then his Pañcavimśa (rite) is accomplished by that (rite) alone.
2.314.14	The Viśvajit (rite) with all the Prstha (rites) and the Atiratra (rite) are performed.
2.314.15	The Prstha rites are the glory of the body.
2.314.16	The lustre of the sun is indeed the highest. They ascend the back of the sun.
2.315.1	Now, if in the six-day Pañcadaśa sacrifice, the Jyotiṣṭoma Agniṣṭoma is in the middle and the Jyotiṣmatī Ātirātra is at the end, then one who desires that his progeny may be endowed with brahmic lustre should perform this sacrifice.
2.315.2	The six-day Paṣṭhya sacrifice is indeed the self.
2.315.3	The Agniṣṭoma is indeed the lustre, the splendour, the light.
2.315.4	The procreation is indeed in the middle of the self.
2.315.5	When the Agniṣṭoma becomes the light in the middle, then he places the light in the very middle of the self, and he is born with splendour in his progeny.
2.315.6	The Jyotiratītra is performed at the end. This is known as the divine path, the Jyotiratītrā. By the known divine path, we shall attain prosperity without misfortune.
2.315.7	Now, if one performs the Agniṣṭoma sacrifices of Viśvajit and Abhijit on either side of this (Agniṣṭoma), then it becomes a six-day sacrifice with the Jyotiṣṭoma in the middle. One who desires cattle should perform this.
2.315.8	These four are the middle Uthyas.
2.315.9	The Uthyas are cattle.
2.315.10	Of them, the Sahasra is the Stotriya.
2.315.11	These four Agniṣṭomas are on both sides.
2.315.12	The Agniṣṭoma is indeed Brahman, the light.
2.315.13	By means of Brahman he thus encloses the cattle on both sides for protection.
2.315.14	He who knows this, his wealth is not taken away by others.
2.315.15	Indeed, one becomes like the lord, whatever kind of lord one worships.
2.315.16	When one thinks that one has become like the lord, then one should worship with this.
2.315.17	Having worshipped, one indeed goes to heaven.
2.316.1	Now these are the nine nights.
2.316.2	One who desires brilliance should worship with this, if it is the nine-night (rite).
2.316.3	The Trivṛt Stoma is brilliance.
2.316.4	This is the Trivṛt Stoma, which the sacrifice has attained.
2.316.5	Therefore, one who desires brilliance should offer this sacrifice.
2.316.6	Some say that one who desires brahmic glory should offer this sacrifice alone.
2.316.7	Brahmic glory is the Trivrt Stoma.
2.316.8	This is the Trivrit Stoma, which has been attained by the sacrifice.
2.316.9	Therefore, he who desires brahmic brilliance should offer this.
2.316.10	Now they say, one should offer this sacrifice for the sake of long life.
2.316.11	The Trivrit stoma is indeed the breath.
2.316.12	There are nine days, the tenth day is the night.
2.316.13	There are ten breaths in man, the navel is the tenth.
2.316.14	One conquers the breaths by this, one obtains the breaths.
2.316.15	They say, what is the significance of the nine-day sacrifice?
2.316.16	One should say, the directions.
2.316.17	The Navaratra (nine nights) indeed is the directions.
2.316.18	There are four directions, four intermediate directions, the upward direction is the ninth, and the downward direction is the tenth.
2.316.19	One attains the directions by this.
2.316.20	Having established oneself in the directions, one goes to the heavenly world.
2.317.1	Now, he for whom this is the three-day sacrifice, namely, Jyotiṣṭoma, Gautama and Ayus, and the three-day Jyotiṣṭoṃa, Gautama and Ayyus, and the Atiratra, he who desires, "May I ascend these worlds without interruption," should offer this sacrifice.
2.317.2	The three-day sacrifice consisting of the Jyotiṣṭoma, Gauṣṭoma and Ayusṭoma is performed. This world is Jyotiṣṭom, this world is Gauṣṭom, that world is Ayusṭom. By this one ascends these worlds without any interruption.
2.317.3	The two Atiratras are the supreme three-day sacrifice.
2.317.4	These worlds are indeed of such a kind. The Agniṣṭoma is like this world, the Ukthya is like that world, and the Atiratra is like this world.
2.317.5	Just as these worlds are arranged, in the same way he ascends them.
2.317.6	Now, he who desires to ascend these worlds without interruption should offer this sacrifice.
2.317.7	Now, the Jyotiṣṭoma, Gauṣṭoma, Ayusṭoma and Atiratra are performed; this world is Jyotiṣṭh, this world is Gauṣṭh, that world is Ayusṭh; thus he ascends these worlds without leaving them behind.
2.317.8	The three days are concluded with the Atiratra.
2.317.9	And in this way, these worlds are like this: the Agniṣṭoma is like this world, the Ukthya is like that world, and the Atiratra is like this world.
2.317.10	Just as these worlds are arranged, so he ascends them.
2.318.1	There are three points of equilibrium for these worlds: Agni is the point of equilibrium for this world, Vayu for the intermediate world, and Aditya for the heavenly world.
2.318.2	He crosses them by means of this (rite).
2.318.3	It consists of three stages, for Indra, to conquer.
2.318.4	The gods conquered the Asuras with the three-fold army of the gods.
2.318.5	Therefore, even now, when the army is three-fold, it conquers.
2.318.6	Just as one who wishes to conquer with a three-fold army marches forward, in the same way, one who wishes to win heaven marches forward. One who knows this conquers heaven.
2.318.7	Now, he for whom this Jyotiṣṭoma-Atirātra is the sixth day of the Pañcavimśa-Sahsra, and the Mahavrata is the Jyotiṣṭhoma, should perform this sacrifice for the sake of food.
2.318.8	They say that one should not perform the Mahavrata before a year.
2.318.9	Now, the reason why it is the sixth day is that the six days are the seasons.
2.318.10	The seasons are the year.
2.318.11	The year cooks the entire food-offering. They obtain the food-offering won by the year.
2.318.12	The Mahavrata sacrifice is of twenty-five (sāman) verses. Food is of twenty- five (sāman verses). For the obtaining of food.
2.318.13	The Jyotiratītrā is the known divine path. The Jyotiratītra is the divine path.
2.318.14	The gods, knowing the auspicious rite, ate without fear.
2.319.1	They call this the Sattra, because they think it is a Sattra. They prepare it in front of the Sattra.
2.319.2	The Stoma of the Sattra and the Dakshina are known by this.
2.319.3	Those who perform the Sattra have two Atiratras at the beginning and at the end. Those who perform the Dakṣiṇāvat have one Atiratra at the end.
2.319.4	One who performs the Dakṣiṇa-vat sacrifice should perform it after having performed the Agniṣṭoma.
2.319.5	Now, in this Pañcaha, the Stomas of the Prsthya sacrifice are performed on the fifth day, the Mahāvrata, Viśvajit Stoma and Atiratra.
2.319.6	And those who sacrifice and those who attend the sacrifice, they indeed speak here only.
2.319.7	They accomplish it on the tenth day.
2.319.8	The speech which is accomplished, unfaltering, established, is attained by the Mahāvrata.
2.319.9	Food is the Mahāvrta.
2.319.10	For the attainment of food.
2.319.11	The Visvajit Stoma is the Atiratra.
2.319.12	It is as if one were to go beyond.
2.319.13	The Visvajit Stotra is the Atirattra, which is as if one has gone beyond the world of heaven.
2.319.14	By this one goes beyond to the world of heaven itself.
2.319.15	And because the fourth Stoma is the Ekavimsa, and the Ekavimsha is stability, he stands firm by it.
2.320.1	Now, if in the middle of this six-day Pañchadasa sacrifice, there are three days called Jyotiḥ, Gauḥ, Āyuḥ, then one who desires progeny should perform this sacrifice.
2.320.2	The six-day Paṅchadasa sacrifice is the self.
2.320.3	These Stotras are for procreation.
2.320.4	When in the middle there are three days named Jyotiḥ, Gaur, Āyuḥ then it places procreation in the middle of the self. One becomes many and is born.
2.320.5	Now, he who desires to go to the heaven and to stay in this world, should offer this sacrifice.
2.320.6	By means of the six-day sacrifice, one goes to the heaven; and by means of the three-day sacrifice, he comes down from the heaven.
2.320.7	One goes to the heaven and stays in this world.
2.320.8	Then indeed he knows, 'He who was that, that am I.' Then indeed he is born again in this world.
2.320.9	Now he who has three days above and six days below, and who desires, 'May I go to the heavenly world and stand in this world,' he should offer this sacrifice.
2.320.10	In three days he goes to heaven, and in six days he comes back.
2.320.11	He goes to heaven and stands in this world.
2.320.12	And he knows, "He who was that, I am this." He is born again in this world.
2.320.13	Now, he for whom this is the sixth day, and the third day is the seventh, he who desires heaven should offer with this (sacrifice).
2.320.14	These Stomas are ascending, and heaven is the ascending world; for the attainment of the world of heaven.
2.321.1	Now, this is the varied (sacrifice).
2.321.2	His Jyotiragniṣṭoma, Gauṣṭoma, Ayusṭoma, Jyotiragnișṭoma, Ayūratīrastra, Jyotiragnisṭoma, Gaușṭoma, Ayyusṭoma, and Jyotiragnişṭoma.
2.321.3	One who desires cattle should offer this sacrifice.
2.321.4	His other two Uksthya sacrifices, Gauṣṭhya and Ayusṭhya, are in between.
2.321.5	The Ukthas are the animals.
2.321.6	Of them, there are five hundred Stotriyas.
2.321.7	The Jyotisis are the Agniṣṭomas on both sides.
2.321.8	Brahma is the Jyotis, the Agniṣṭoma.
2.321.9	He thus encloses the animals on both sides with Brahma, for the purpose of protection.
2.321.10	He whose knowledge is thus, his wealth is not taken away by others.
2.321.11	The Atiratra sacrifice comes in the middle.
2.321.12	Just as a well-built house has a strong middle, so is this.
2.321.13	The two Upavasatha sacrifices come at the end of it.
2.321.14	The Upavasatha is the animal sacrifice.
2.321.15	There are five hundred Stotriya verses in them.
2.321.16	The Jyotisa and Agnistomas come at the end.
2.321.17	The Agniṣṭoma is indeed Brahman, the light.
2.321.18	By means of Brahman he thus encloses the animals on both sides for non-deprivation.
2.321.19	He whose wealth is not taken away by others, knows this.
2.322.1	Now these ten-night (sacrifices).
2.322.2	One who is being cursed should offer this sacrifice. The ten-night (sacrifice) is indeed that.
2.322.3	There are ten such days.
2.322.4	There are indeed ten vital airs in a man.
2.322.5	He takes the Prāṇa in a day, the Prāṇa by day, the Prāna by day. Then that Prāṇa of his does not exceed, whom he would strike with this.
2.322.6	They say, one should perform this sacrifice only against an enemy.
2.322.7	There are ten such days.
2.322.8	There are十prāṇas in man.
2.322.9	He takes away the life of the enemy in a day, in a day he takes away the life, in a day the life.
2.322.10	There is no life left of the enemy by which he would live if attacked.
2.322.11	This indeed is the most important rite, that this Soma sacrifice of ten days is performed according to the prescribed procedure.
2.322.12	That is the highest of all acts, and by that our sacrifice is performed.
2.323.1	This indeed is the highest limit of speech, when it says 'ten'.
2.323.2	This is the highest limit that speech has reached.
2.323.3	And whatever is the highest limit reached by speech, that one obtains completely.
2.323.4	Some say: One should perform this sacrifice only if one desires food.
2.323.5	All others indeed praise Viraj.
2.323.6	But he alone praises Viraj who praises with ten (verses).
2.323.7	Viraj has ten syllables.
2.323.8	Viraj is food.
2.323.9	He obtains Viraj by day, by day he obtains Viraj, by day he attains Viraj. By the tenth day he obtains all Viraj, the food, and rises up at last.
2.323.10	The man indeed is superior to Viraj.
2.323.11	There are ten days and the eleventh is the night.
2.323.12	There are the ten breaths in the man and the eleventh is his self.
2.323.13	This man indeed is mounted on Viraj for the purpose of accomplishing it.
2.323.14	For no cow, horse or ass stands on Viraj.
2.323.15	The man indeed stands on Viraj.
2.323.16	Therefore, the person is the owner of the animals.
2.323.17	He who knows this becomes the owner of the cattle and stands above the supreme.
2.324.1	Indra, having struck Vritra with the thunderbolt, thinking, "I am not thirsty," was amazed.
2.324.2	He, the green one, amazed, became old.
2.324.3	He thought, "How can I go to the tenth place of this green sin?"
2.324.4-9	He saw this sacrifice of ten nights. He brought it. He performed it. Then he went to the tenth stage of purification of that sin of Hari. One who knows this goes to the tenth stage for the purification of the sin of Hari. Therefore, they ask one who is wounded, born, or fallen, "Did you go to the tenth stage?"
2.324.10	Those who know this go to the tenth stage of Harima's sin.
2.324.11	One who knows this goes to the tenth stage (of Harima's) sin.
2.325.1	Now this is the Trikakup.
2.325.2	One who desires progeny should offer this sacrifice.
2.325.3	The Stotras are Trivrit and Panchasad.
2.325.4	They are deficient and excessive, a pair, generating.
2.325.5	One is deficient, the other is in excess.
2.325.6	From the deficient and the excess, the animals are born.
2.325.7	They perform the Trivṛt Stoma.
2.325.8	They generate it.
2.325.9	The Stomas are seventeen and twenty-one.
2.325.10	They are deficient and excess, the pair generates.
2.325.11	One is deficient, the others are in excess.
2.325.12	From the union of the deficient and the excessive, offspring and cattle are born.
2.325.13	They perform the seventeenfold Stoma.
2.325.14	They generate him.
2.325.15	The Stomas are the Tri-navas and the Trayastrimshas.
2.325.16	They are the deficient and the excess, the union, the generation.
2.325.17	One is deficient, the other is excessive.
2.325.18	From the union of the deficient and the excessive are born offspring and cattle.
2.325.19	They perform the Stoma of three nines.
2.325.20	They generate him (Agni).
2.325.21	They say, "The Stomas are obtained, the metres are obtained, the deities are obtained, the seasons are obtained, the houses are obtained, when this six-day Pañcadaśa Stoma is obtained."
2.325.22-26	They should chant the Agniya hymns on the seventh day, which are not redundant. Agni is the one who is not redundant among the gods. They worship Agni, knowing him to be the one who is non-redundant among the gods. They should chant the Indra hymns on the eighth day, which are non-redundant. Indra is the one who does not become redundant among the gods.
2.325.27	They worship Indra, the one who is not exhausted among the gods.
2.325.28	They should praise on the ninth day in the Vaisvadevī verses, which are not exhausted.
2.325.29	The Viśve Devas are the ones who are not exhausted among the deities.
2.325.30	They worship the Viśve Devatās, the ones who are inexhaustible among the deities.
2.325.31	The Sarvas toma Atiratra is performed. It is for the conquest and advance of all worlds.
2.325.32	For all this is indeed the Stoma.
2.325.33	And when we have come to these one by one, we shall enjoy them together, having established ourselves in them, and shall enjoy them for ever.
2.326.1	Now this is the five-sacrificial rite.
2.326.2	The five divine coverings are the power of this (verse).
2.326.3	The sacrifice is fivefold, the animals are fivefold, the food is fivefold, and the five seasons. Whatever is fivefold, this is the power of all that, and its attainment.
2.326.4	They do not perform this rite at night, lest they should transgress Viraj.
2.326.5	They say that the Dasaraatra sacrifice is indeed a great sacrifice.
2.326.6	The reason why this sacrifice is performed for five days and the Dasaraatra for ten days is that one who performs the Dasaraatra attains his desire.
2.326.7	The Atiratra sacrifice is performed with all Stoma verses for the conquest and supremacy of all worlds.
2.326.8	All these worlds are indeed Stoma verses.
2.326.9	Then, having united all these individual Stoma-s, and having established ourselves in them, we shall eat together.
2.326.10	Now this is the seven-sacrificial rite.
2.326.11	This is the prosperity of those seven divine coverings.
2.326.12	The seven-footed Sakvarī verses, the seven domestic animals, the seven and four extra metres, the seven principal breaths, the twenty-seven heavenly stars, the twenty-seventh Stoma, whatever there is in sevens, this is the prosperity of all that, this is its attainment.
2.326.13	They say, "The ten-night sacrifice indeed exceeds the measure of the sacrifice."
2.326.14	Now, when this is the seven-day sacrifice, it is known as the Saptaha. One who has performed the Dasaratha sacrifice attains the desired goal.
2.326.15	The Atiratra with all Stoma-s is performed. It is for the conquest and advance of all worlds.
2.326.16	For everything here is indeed Stoma.
2.326.17	Then, having united all these Stomas one by one, and having established ourselves in them, we shall eat together.
2.327.1	Now this is the great Trikakup.
2.327.2	If one desires prosperity, if one desires to be a Purohita, one should offer with this.
2.327.3	Three are the seasons, three are the prosperities, these are the three worlds.
2.327.4	One attains that very thing.
2.327.5-10	The Trivṛt Stoma is praised by the Pañcadaśa Stoma. The Trivṛt is Brahman, the Pañcadaša is Ksatra. Thus they encompass the Ksatra with Brahman. The Saptādaśa Stoma is praised with the Ekavimśa Stoma The Saptāḍa is Brahman, the Ekavimsa is Ksatra. Thus they encompass the Ksatriya with Brahman.
2.327.11	With the Tri-navas they praise the Tri-trimsas.
2.327.12	Brahma is Tri-navas, Kshatra is Tri-trimsat.
2.327.13	By Brahma they embrace Kshatra.
2.327.14	When Brahma embraces Kshatra, then he goes to his Purohita. He goes to the Purohita, and he places him in front.
2.328.1	This is indeed the great Tri-kakubha.
2.328.2	The three directions are the three directions of these worlds.
2.328.3	Agni is the direction of this world, Vayu of the intermediate space, Aditya of the heaven.
2.328.4	He who knows this becomes one with the directions.
2.328.5	The Viśvajit is performed with all the Prsthya (Stotras).
2.328.6	The Prsthya Stotras are the glory and the height.
2.328.7	One thus ascends the glory and the Prsthyas.
2.328.8	The Prsthyas are strength and valour.
2.328.9-11	By the very power and strength of that (fire) he then takes up the Purodāsa. The Agniṣṭoma Sāmans are different from each other, so that they do not follow one another. "May the goddesses be gracious to us for prosperity, that golden one with the highest (Sāman). The Yajñāyajñiya and the Sākamāśva."
2.328.12	O Agni, the lord of wealth, the guest of each clan, may we hear the words of each clan.
2.328.13	O Agni, may we kindle your head, the desire of heaven and earth. (This is) for Sanjaya and Dirgashravya.
2.328.14	O Agni! Men kindle you with kindling woods. You are the lord of the house. (This is for) Brihat and Agnieya and Samanta.
2.328.15	The Agni who is kindled, with the hymn, we praise him, for our sacrifice, touching the heaven. This is the Rajo-vajiya and Brihat.
2.329.1	With this very (hymn) Jabala Aruni performed the sacrifice.
2.329.2	He went to the Purodhas of three Nigrhnas - Kaushika, Kausalya and Ikhsvaku.
2.329.3	His prosperity was very auspicious.
2.329.4	Now, when he saw his father's prosperity, Śvetaketu, the son of Uddālaka, disputed with his father, saying, "O grey-haired one, you are seeking the sacrifice, but you are serving others with prosperity and fame, not yourself."
2.329.5	"No," he replied.
2.329.6	"Do not say so, my son."
2.329.7	"I know the sacrifice well."
2.329.8	"He is like a sinner, seeking the sacrifice among the Brahmins."
2.329.9	He indeed is the same as they have told me.
2.329.10	Or rather, he is more than that.
2.329.11	He indeed is this sacrifice, the deceit of death.
2.329.12	The gods were afraid of death, who was in the world of heaven.
2.329.13	Therefore they approached Prajapati.
2.329.14	He created this ten-night sacrifice for them.
2.329.15	They brought it.
2.329.16	They performed it.
2.330.1	They praised with the Trivṛt.
2.330.2	They praised with the Trivrta, thinking, "Death has gone beyond the fifteen (verses) and has stood still. It will come to this (place)."
2.330.3	They followed him with the fifteen (verses).
2.330.4	They then bound him with the seventeen (verses).
2.330.5	He then went beyond the seventeen (verses) and stood still.
2.330.6	Then the others, having praised with the fifteen (verse), again praised with the Trivt.
2.330.7	They (the gods) praised with the Trivṛt (Stoma). Death pursued the Pañcadaśa (Stoma), thinking, 'It will come to this.'
2.330.8	Then the others went beyond the Saptadaśa (Stomas).
2.330.9	They praised with the Saptadaśas.
2.330.10	They (the gods) praisd with the Saptadaša (Stoma). Thinking, 'Death will pursue the Ekavimsa (Stoma)', he stood still, thinking, 'It (the Ekavimsa Stoma) will come to this.
2.330.11-15	He (the sacrificer) followed him in the twenty-one (stotra). He (the sacrificer), having followed him, then went up to him. He (the Sacrificer) then went out in the twenty-nine (stotra). Then the other (the sacrificer's opponent) having praised in the twenty- one (stotra), again praised in the seventeen (stotra). When they praise in the seventeen (stotrā), Death runs towards the twenty-one, thinking, 'They will come to this (stotra).'
2.330.16	Then the others went beyond the Trinava.
2.330.17	They praised with the Trinava. "
2.330.18	They praised with Trinava, thinking, 'Death will go beyond the Trayastrimsa and stand here, knowing that they will come from there.'
2.330.19	They followed him in the Trayastrimsas.
2.330.20	They raised him up from there.
2.330.21	He went beyond the Chandomas.
2.330.22	Then the other three, having praised with the Trayastrimsa, again praised with the Trinava.
2.330.23	When they praised with the Trinavas, Death rushed upon the Trayastrimsas, thinking, "They will come to this."
2.331.1	Then the others resorted to the father, the creator, the Visvajit, the Sarvaprstha.
2.331.2	Then indeed they, having slain Death, became immortal.
2.331.3	He who knows thus becomes immortal, having slain Death.
2.331.4	Then these are the ten days of Agniṣṭoma.
2.331.5	From these very Sāmans indeed Prajapati gave the Soma-drink.
2.331.6	These are the Sāmans that have been given the Soma-drink, that have been removed from sin.
2.331.7	He who knows this becomes better by removing evil.
2.331.8	These indeed are the full Sama-s of desires.
2.331.9	Just as a shield is soaked with curds, ghee or honey, so are these Sama-s full of desires.
2.331.10	These indeed were sung by Kumstha at that time with the Kala-s.
2.331.11	He always pours the red horses, like from a wood.
2.331.12	The jars are full, flowing, in Janamejaya's house.
2.331.13	He who desires with these Sama hymns, he attains him.
2.331.14	Then there are twelve days of the twelve-day ritual.
2.331.15	These indeed are the powerful days, which are the twelve days of the ritual.
2.331.16	Those days which are powerful, they do not praise what is not true.
2.331.17	They are carried by different Stotras.
2.331.18	This indeed is the prosperity of the days, that they are carried by different stotras.
2.331.19	This is the prosperity of days, this is done.
2.332.1	Now this is the Kusurvind-dasa-ratra.
2.332.2	He who desires to be lustrous, brilliant, powerful, vigorous, and to be a consumer of food, should offer this sacrifice.
2.332.3	The Trivrt stoma is splendour, the Pañcadaśa stoma is strength and vigour, the Saptadaśa stoma food, the Jyotiṣṭoma is prosperity, the Atiratra is light. He who performs this attains these desires.
2.332.4	The Atiratra is heard of in the Jyotiṣtoma. He attains the desire which is in the Dasara tra.
2.332.5	Now, indeed, when the sacrifice was suspended, two Brahmanas were together. "One said, "O Soma, which sacrifice will be suspended?"
2.332.6	One of them said, "If it is tomorrow, then we will perform the Agniṣṭoma. We will perform the Daso sacrifice for you."
2.332.7	Now, indeed, they make it the Agniṣṭoma itself, for these are the Agniṣṭomas of the Agniṣṭomah. Then this is the Abhirit with two ends.
2.333.1	Of it the Agniṣtoma with three Stotras is in front, the Agniṣṭom with three Stotras above, eight Ukthyas, seventeen in the middle.
2.333.2	One who desires food should offer this sacrifice.
2.333.3	Agni is the earlier Trivrt (stoma), Aditya is the later.
2.333.4	Agni indeed is the threshold of this world, Aditya of the other world.
2.333.5	Therefore one should offer this sacrifice for food.
2.333.6	Eight Ukthyas (Stotras) in the middle, seventeen.
2.333.7	This Agni here gives this food, Aditya from there gives rain from there.
2.333.8	They give him food from both sides. He who knows this becomes a food-giver.
2.333.9	Some say, "One should offer this sacrifice for the sake of cattle."
2.333.10	It has two Agniṣṭoma sacrifices on either side, and Ukthya in between.
2.333.11	Agniṣṭoma is Brahman, Ukthas are cattle.
2.333.12	Brahma himself takes the animals on both sides for the purpose of protection.
2.333.13	One who knows this, his wealth is not taken away by others.
2.333.14	Now, he for whom this is the six-day sacrifice, the three-day sacrifice above, the Jyotiṣṭoma and the Atiratra, he should perform this sacrifice for attaining heaven.
2.333.15	These Stotras are ascending; the heavenly world is ascending; for the attainment of the heavenly world.
2.333.16	Now, he who has this Jyotiragaurayu-Atiratra, the Jyotiragauraya-Atiratra is the Jyotiragaura-Atiratra. He who desires, 'May I conquer the worlds of the luminous ones', let him offer this sacrifice.
2.333.17	The four lights of the gods, as it were, are Agni on earth, Aditya in heaven, the moon among the stars, and lightning in the water.
2.333.18	He who, knowing this, performs this sacrifice, and he who knows this, conquers these worlds of light.
2.334.1	Now this is the thirteen-night sacrifice.
2.334.2	Now, the sun was equal to other gods. He was equal to Agni, Vayu, Moon and other gods.
2.334.3	He desired, 'May I go to the foremost position among all gods. May I ascend over everything by becoming the thirteenth month.'
2.334.4	He saw this thirteen-night (rite).
2.334.5	He approached it.
2.334.6	Then he attained the highest position among all the gods.
2.334.7	Having become the thirteenth month, he ascended over all this.
2.334.8	The year is all this.
2.334.9	Those very Stotras, those very Prsthas, those very metres, those very Savanas, those very gods, those very worlds, those very desires.
2.334.10	Having attained the twelve months in twelve days, he became the thirteenth month in the thirteenth day and ascended over all this.
2.334.11	Those who know this and perform the thirteen-night sacrifice attain this very (state) and go to the same world as this (state).
2.335.1	This is the annual sacrifice.
2.335.2	The prosperity of that (sacrifice) is the same prosperity.
2.335.3	The month, indeed, when it is passing away, attains the year.
2.335.4	They desire the year, they seek the year, when they perform sacrifice, when they sit in a session.
2.335.5	For there is nothing outside the year.
2.335.6	The fourteen nights are indeed the sovereignty.
2.335.7	Seven nights beyond and seven nights before.
2.335.8	Now that which is in the middle of the world, that is the king, that is the heaven world.
2.335.9	They go to that highest place of the Brahman, they go to that sovereignty.
2.335.10	They are not followed by others.
2.335.11	These nights are completed, Viraj and Gayatri.
2.335.12	Indeed, these two metres are the most powerful among the metres, namely Viraj and Gayatra.
2.335.13	Those who are the most vigorous among the metres, we have attained them, we have stood firm in them. There is no praise that is not theirs.
2.335.14	They go up to Viraj.
2.335.15	They go to Viraj's sovereignty and lordship over food.
2.335.16	Viraj is two less than a hundred. Two are less than her, from where she is born. By that she is generated.
2.335.17	The Vaishvanara is the Pravargya sacrifice, and the Atiratra is the Soma sacrifice.
2.335.18	For the Soma sacrifices of the Ahinas are offered to Vaishvanara.
2.336.1	Now this is the six-day sacrifice of the Prsthya kind.
2.336.2	The Prsthya sacrifices are prosperity, the Prsthyas are greatness.
2.336.3	They ascend the Prsthvas, which are prosperity and greatness.
2.336.4	They become those who perform the Sattra.
2.336.5	They say, "Those who undertake this six-day sacrifice of the Prsthya ascend to a higher state."
2.336.6	The six-day sacrifice called Prsthya is performed after this (the New and Full Moon sacrifices) for the sake of protection, for the sake of non-injury, for the sake peace.
2.336.7	But they say this about it: "Those who undertake the six-day sacrifice known as Prsthya, undertake it in this way.
2.336.8	The Atiratra sacrifice is dedicated to Vaisvânara.
2.336.9	The Soma sacrifices of the Ahina series are dedicated to Vaisvanara.
2.336.10	Then there are the Stotras called Jyotis, Gauri and Ayushi.
2.336.11	These are the auspicious, peaceful and suitable Stotras, namely Jyotis, Gouri and Ayushi.
2.336.12	Those who are auspicious, peaceful, and beneficial, they have not been praised by them.
2.336.13	They have attained Viraj.
2.336.14	They undertake Viraj as food.
2.336.15	He who, not knowing the superior, climbs up to it, he is indeed harmed by it.
2.336.16	By what he desires from it out of distress, he leads him to it.
2.336.17	Now he who, having known it, having approached it, mounts the chariot, he does not fall from it.
2.336.18	And in that these are the Stotras, 'Light', 'Cow', 'Life', it is as one who, having known the better, having approached it mounts the chariot.
2.337.1	Then there is this six-day Prsthya (Satra).
2.337.2	The Prstha (Stotras) are indeed prosperity, the Prstha (stotrās) are indeed greatness.
2.337.3	The glory of that (sacrifice) is attained by the backs of the animals.
2.337.4	That is what the sacrificers become.
2.337.5	They say, 'Those who perform this six-day sacrifice of the Prsthya (Stoma) ascend as if to the top (of a tree).'
2.337.6	He who, having ascended the top of a large tree, does not know how to descend, he falls and perishes, or he falls down. That (tree) above him dries up.
2.337.7	Now, the three days that follow are for the sake of protection, for the sake of freedom from distress, for the sake (of attaining) the auspicious, for the sake peace.
2.337.8	They rise from the day of the Jyotis (Sutra) from the known, from the Jyestha, from the Stoma.
2.337.9	Having established themselves in the known, in the Jyestha Stoma, we shall eat the food of the Udgitha.
2.337.10	It has twelve Stotras, the year has twelve months.
2.337.11	The year is the most excellent; there is no rival to it. The most excellent is the Stoma. Having attained the most excellent, we shall eat in abundance.
2.337.12	The Atiratra of the rising of Vaisvānara is performed.
2.337.13	The Soma-offerings of the rising of the Vaisvānaran are indeed without loss.
2.338.1	Now these are the twelve-day (sacrifices). Indeed, this is the sacrifice of the gods, this is the sacrificial session of Prajapati, that is the twelve-day sacrifice.
2.338.2	By this sacrificial session Prajapati succeeded. By that sacrificial session by which Prajapati succeeded, we shall succeed.
2.338.3	They say, what is the extent of the sacrificial sessions?
2.338.4	One should say, the twelve-day.
2.338.5	The twelve-day sacrifice is the highest of all sacrifices, for in no other sacrifice is there a Stoma of forty-four or of thirty-eight.
2.338.6	"That which is the highest of sacrifices, that is not to be surpassed."
2.338.7	"Those who perform sacrifices and those who attend the sacrifice, they indeed speak here and there."
2.338.8	They accomplish it in ten days.
2.338.9	"We eat the food of the accomplished, the unfaltering, the established."
2.338.10	With one sacrifice they perform two sacrifices: the twelve-day and the fourteen-night.
2.338.11	The Atiratra of the rising Vaisvānara is performed.
2.338.12	The rising Vaisvânaras are the Soma sacrifices without loss.
2.339.1	This is the sacrifice of a month.
2.339.2	The prosperity of that (sacrifice) is the same as this.
2.339.3	Indeed, the month, when it passes away again and again, attains the year.
2.339.4	They desire the year, they seek the year, when they perform sacrifices, when they sit in a sacrifice.
2.339.5	For there is nothing outside the year.
2.339.6	The fifteen nights are indeed the self-sovereignty.
2.339.7	Seven days beyond and seven days before.
2.339.8	And what is the day in the middle, that is the self-sovereign, that is the heavenly world.
2.339.9	They go to the expanse of the sun, they go to self-sovereignty,
2.339.10	and others do not follow them.
2.339.11	Indeed, the fifteen-night sacrifice is indeed a thunderbolt.
2.339.12	The gods, with the fifteen-night sacrifice, conquered the Asuras with the thunderbolt.
2.339.13	Those who think they are like those who have been seized by sin should perform this fifteen-night sacrifice.
2.339.14	With the fifteen-night rite, they conquer and rise up over their enemies, the sinful ones.
2.339.15	He said, "O Yama, the brother of Bhṛata, I have conquered Sarasvati with a fifteen-night-long thunderbolt. Who else is worthy of conquering her?
2.339.16	I conquered her with a thunderbolt.
2.339.17	The thunderbolt is indeed invincible.
2.339.18	Those nights are completed, and they are Viraj and Gayatri.
2.339.19	These indeed are the most powerful of the metres, namely Viraj and Gayatri.
2.339.20	Those who are the most powerful among the metres, we attain their prosperity, we stand in their stead, we do not sing their praise.
2.339.21	They approach Viraj.
2.339.22	They attain the sovereignty and lordship of Viraj's food.
2.339.23	The Viraj is one less than the number of the verses. Since the woman is born from that, it is the begetting of offspring.
2.339.24	The Pravargya-Atiratra is performed as Vaishvanara.
2.339.25	Because the Soma sacrifices are performed as Vaishvnar.
2.340.1	Then there are the Stotras called Jyoti, Gau and Ayus.
2.340.2	These indeed are the auspicious, peaceful, beneficial Stotras, namely, Jyotis, Gauri, Ayushi.
2.340.3	Those who are auspicious, peaceful, and beneficial Stotras, they have not been praised by them.
2.340.4	They have attained Viraj.
2.340.5	They undertake Viraj as food.
2.340.6	He who, not knowing the superior one, mounts upon it, is indeed injured by it. He desires it out of distress. He leads him to it.
2.340.7	But he who, knowing it, approaches it and mounts upon it, does not injure it.
2.340.8	Now, in that the Stotras are Jyotiḥ, Gauḥ, Āyuḥ, it is like this: one would ascend to a higher position by means of a concordant agreement.
2.340.9	Then there is this Agniṣṭoma with three Stotras.
2.340.10	Brahman is three-fold.
2.340.11	The six-day Pañcadaśa is the Kshatra.
2.340.12	Now, when they perform the Agniṣṭoma rite before the six-day Pañcahas sacrifice, then he places the Brahman before the Kshatra.
2.340.13	Therefore the Brahman is the Purohita of the Kshatriya.
2.340.14	And with one Sattra they perform two Sattras, the twelve-day and the fifteen-day.
2.340.15	The Vaisvānara Udayaniya Atiratra becomes the concluding rite.
2.340.16	The Soma-pressings are the rising of the all-pervading fire.
2.341.1	This is a two-month-long session.
2.341.2	The prosperity of that is the same as this.
2.341.3	For the two months are the prosperity of the seasons.
2.341.4	The season is the prosperity of the year.
2.341.5	They desire the year, they desire the year when they perform sacrifice, when they sit in session.
2.341.6	There is nothing outside the year.
2.341.7	The twenty-one nights are indeed the self-sovereignty, ten nights before and ten after.
2.341.8	And what is the day in the middle, that is the self-sovereign, that is the heavenly world.
2.341.9	They go to the expanse of the sun, they go to self-sovereignty.
2.341.10	That is not followed by others.
2.341.11	Those nights are completed, indeed, it is Viraj.
2.341.12	They attain lordship over food and drink of Viraj.
2.341.13	Five and Viraj.
2.341.14	Those five divine coverings, their power is this.
2.341.15	The sacrifice is fivefold, the animals are fivefold, the food is fivefold, and the seasons are fivefold. Whatever there is that is fivefold, this is the prosperity of all that, and its attainment.
2.342.1	These ten days are beyond, and ten are before, and the equinoctial point is the twenty-first.
2.342.2	Ten are the fingers of a man's hand, ten are the toes, and the body is the twenty-one.
2.342.3-8	This man, indeed, is mounted on Viraj for the purpose of not attaining (the goal). For a cow, a horse, or an ass does not stand on Viraj. But a man, indeed, stands on Viraj. Therefore, a man is the lord of animals. One who knows this becomes the lord of animals and stands on Viraj.
2.342.9	In the month of summer, Prajapati gave light to the sun.
2.342.10	Therefore, in the month of summer he shines with greater strength, and even twice the shadows approach him.
2.342.11	Agradeva, the king, approached him, desiring brahminical splendor.
2.342.12	Then a Brāhmaṇa said to him, "As long as the lustre of Brahman is not exhausted, Abhiśveta will be."
2.342.13	He was like a white horse.
2.342.14	These nights are so lustrous, so full of Brahmanic lustre, so full of energy.
2.342.15	Those who know this and perform these nights, all of them prosper, all of them become lustrous.
2.342.16	On them they should offer a Vayu-animal sacrifice. Vayu is peace; through peace they are not consumed.
2.342.17	The Atiratra of the Pravargya is dedicated to Vaisvânara.
2.342.18	For the Soma sacrifices dedicated to Vaisvanara are without loss.
2.343.1	Now there is this six-day sacrifice of the Prsthya kind.
2.343.2	The Prsthya (sacrifices) are indeed prosperity, the Prsthyas are greatness.
2.343.3	They ascend the Prsthvas, prosperity and greatness.
2.343.4	They become those who perform the Sattra.
2.343.5	Now these are the seventeen Svārasāman (sacrifices), the days of Prajapati, three beyond and three below.
2.343.6	Prajapati is indeed this (universe) divided into two parts. He bestows light on the sun.
2.343.7	"He who is the bestower of light, by whom light has been bestowed, may he bestow light on us."
2.343.8	Then this (rite) becomes the Ekavimsa (rite) of Visuva.
2.343.9	Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun are the twenty-one.
2.343.10	Those who go to the same world as this, they ascend to him.
2.343.11	They say, "They ascend to the superior one, namely, the sun."
2.343.12	That the six-day Prsthya is beyond that, is for the sake of avoiding misfortune, for the sake of peace, for the sake peace.
2.343.13	The Vaisvānara Udayaniya Atiratra is performed.
2.343.14	The Soma-offerings are indeed the birth-place of the all-pervading fire.
2.344.1	Now, in the middle of the six-day Pañcadaśa sacrifice, they perform the Triṃśat sacrifice.
2.344.2	Those who desire progeny should perform this sacrifice.
2.344.3	The Pañcadaśin sacrifice is indeed the begetter of progeny.
2.344.4	The Stotras are begotten by six, the Chandaḥs by four.
2.344.5	Now this Stoma of seventeen is placed in the middle, surrounded by six Stomas.
2.344.6	It stands as if concealing procreation.
2.344.7	When they place it above the thirty-three Stomas, it is from the concealed procreation that the offspring are born.
2.344.8	The two seventeen Stomas are for the sake of the third.
2.344.9	Now these two, the Viśvajit and the Abhijit, are the strength of the Stotras.
2.344.10	For by strength they support the Visuvat.
2.344.11	For the sacrifice is indeed a great thing, namely the Viśvaji and the Abhijit.
2.344.12	For by these the sacrifice is supported.
2.344.13	For the bed of the gods is indeed the Viśva-jit and the Abhi-jit, and the sun is the Ksatra.
2.344.14	The Kshatriya class is indeed the bed of the gods.
2.344.15	Therefore, the Kshatriya is the one who is elevated above the Vaishya.
2.344.16	Now this is the twenty-first Visuva (equinox).
2.344.17	There are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun as the twenty-first.
2.344.18	They attain the same world as this, they ascend to this.
2.344.19	They say, "They ascend to the superior ones, those who perform this (sacrifice) to the sun."
2.344.20	That it is performed in this way beyond (the normal) six-day (sacrifice) is for the sake of protection, for the sake of non-injury, for the sake (of attaining) auspiciousness, for the sake peace.
2.344.21	The Atiratra sacrifice dedicated to Vaisvânara is performed at sunrise.
2.344.22	The Soma sacrifices dedicated to Vaisvanara are performed at sunrise.
2.345.1	Now this is the five-day rite.
2.345.2	For indeed, the Ekavimsa-atra is not the one which is the Visuvat.
2.345.3	Which is that Visuvat, in which the Vishvajit and Abhijit are not performed?
2.345.4	When the Vishvajit is performed, it is said, "We have obtained the entire Visuvat, the entire Visuvan has come to us."
2.345.5	They say, "Those who perform these rites ascend to a higher state."
2.345.6	The five-day rite that follows is for the sake of protection, for the sake of freedom from distress, for the sake peace.
2.345.7	The Atiratra of the rising Vaisvānara is performed.
2.345.8	The Soma sacrifices of the rising Vāsuvanara are without loss.
2.346.1	This is a two-month-long session.
2.346.2	That is the prosperity of the Rtu.
2.346.3	Those two months are indeed the prosperity of the Rtus.
2.346.4	The Rtus are indeed the prosperity in the form of the Samvatsara.
2.346.5	They desire the Samvatsara, they desire the Samvatsaras when they perform sacrifices, when they sit in the Sattra.
2.346.6	For there is nothing outside the Samvatsara.
2.346.7	The twenty-four nights are indeed the self-sovereignty, twelve nights before and twelve after.
2.346.8	Now the world in the middle is the self-sovereign, that is the world of heaven.
2.346.9	They go to the expanse of the sun, they go to self-sovereignty.
2.346.10	They are not followed by others.
2.346.11	These nights are completed, indeed the Jagati.
2.346.12	The Jagati is indeed cattle.
2.346.13	By that this sacrifice becomes cattle-yielding.
2.346.14	They go to the Viraj.
2.346.15	They attain the sovereignty and lordship of food by that.
2.346.16	The Viraj is two less than the number of women. From where it is born, that is the reproduction.
2.346.17	They attain completion with the Gāyatrī through the Upasads and the Soma-pressings.
2.346.18	Praṇa is the Gayatri. By that this sacrifice is for the sake of life.
2.346.19	Tejas is the Gayatri, by that they become lustrous and brilliant.
2.346.20	The Gayatri is the eldest. By that they stand in the eldest position without a rival.
2.347.1	Then there are these seven days. The seven are the metres.
2.347.2	The worlds are the self-sovereignty of the Chandas. As much as the world is self-sovereignty, so much self-sovereignty in the world we attain.
2.347.3	There are seven vital airs.
2.347.4	Through the vital airs, offspring and cattle are held and stand up.
2.347.5	Those beings and cattle which are held by those vital airs, may they stand near us.
2.347.6	The gods went to heaven by means of the vital airs.
2.347.7	By those vital airs by which the gods went to heaven, may we go to heaven.
2.347.8	There are seven principal vital airs.
2.347.9	These indeed are the Apha-ta-pa-m-na-s, the vital airs, which are the chief.
2.347.10	"Those who are the Apha -ta-pa-ma-nas, the vital airs; by their measure we shall perform the sacrifice."
2.347.11	The Agni-stoma sacrifices are more numerous than the Ukthya sacrifices.
2.347.12	Brahma is the Agni-stoma.
2.347.13	They obtain that Brahmic glory.
2.347.14	They become Brahmic.
2.347.15	The Agniṣṭoma sacrifices are performed beyond (the Soma-pressing days), the Agniṣṭoma and Ukthya sacrifices are performed before (the Soma- pressing days), the Ukthya sacrifices in between.
2.347.16	The Agniṣṭoma is Brahman, the Ukthya is cattle.
2.347.17	Thus they enclose the cattle on both sides by Brahman, so that his wealth is not taken away by others. He who knows thus.
2.347.18	The Vaiśvānara is the Prāyaṇīya Atiratra.
2.347.19	The Soma-offerings are dedicated to Vaisvânara.
2.348.1	Now these are the Stoma-offerings of the six-day Pañcadaça sacrifice.
2.348.2	The Pañcadaça is prosperity, the Pañcadaça the height.
2.348.3	They ascend the Pañcadaças, prosperity and height.
2.348.4	They become those who are performing a Sattra.
2.348.5	Now this is the thirty-third day.
2.348.6	From the Trayastrimsa (Stoma) itself, the Trayastrimsas.
2.348.7	For he is within.
2.348.8	From where else would they bring it?
2.348.9	His Bahispavamana is of thirty-four (Stomas).
2.348.10	The deities are thirty-three.
2.348.11	Prajapati is thirty-four.
2.348.12	Prajapali is the sixth abode of the deities.
2.348.13	Now the seventh day is the world of sovereignty.
2.348.14	And the thirty-four (verses) are sovereignty.
2.348.15	In that the thirty-four verses of the seventh day are the outer Prausthamada, it is so that one may attain the world of sovereignty as much as the world of sovereignty is.
2.348.16	And also for the continuity of the thirty-three (verses) of the three (days).
2.348.17	The nights of Pratipad are indeed the form of the moon.
2.348.18	This six-day period is above, the middle is horizontal, and the one below is below.
2.348.19	The nights of Pratipada are indeed the form.
2.348.20	One who attains prosperity attains the Pratipada.
2.348.21	"We shall attain the Pratipada, the seniority, the preeminence, the prosperity."
2.348.22	Therefore they perform these nights.
2.348.23	They say, "Those who perform these nights ascend to a higher state."
2.348.24	The reason why the Stotras of the sixth day of the Prsthya Sastra are performed in reverse order is for the sake of avoiding misfortune, for the sake of peace, for the sake peace.
2.348.25	They rise from the Jyotisha day as described in the Brāhmaṇa.
2.348.26	The Vaishvānara Udayaniya Atiratra is performed.
2.348.27	The Soma-offerings of the Vaishvānaran are indeed the Soma-offerings without loss.
2.349.1	Now, if this (Soma-sacrifice) is to be performed for thirty-four days, then one should attain the world of sovereignty with all the days.
2.349.2	And for the continuity of the thirty-three.
2.349.3	Then indeed Bhallāyeya said, "One should not undertake the Great Vrata before a year."
2.349.4	"If one undertakes it, one should undertake it on the twenty-four nights."
2.349.5	The twenty-four nights are indeed the year.
2.349.6	The year has twenty-four half-months.
2.349.7	He is indeed surrounded on both sides by the year.
2.349.8-13	Now, the seventeenth day is in the middle of that (fortnight). One should approach on that very day. Prajapati is indeed seventeen. The great vow is connected with Prajapati. Prajapti is the deity in the middle. Where Prajapati is the deity in middle, we shall prosper Prajapati. For Prajapati is in the middle. The food eaten in the middle nourishes.
2.349.14	Now, when they perform in this way, they rise up after having removed hunger from the middle.
2.349.15	They say, "Those who perform these nights, they indeed ascend to a better state."
2.349.16	Now, when the Stotras of the six-day Pañcahas are performed in reverse order, it is for the sake of removal, for non-injury, for auspiciousness, for peace.
2.349.17	From the Brāhmaṇa that has been stated, it is known that one should rise with the Gayatri verse of the Jyotisha.
2.349.18	Indeed, this is the Gayatri verse.
2.349.19	If one were to rise with the Gayatra verse, one would be powerful and without support, wandering.
2.349.20	"Savitar with the instruments made the earth firm." One should recite this Savitar verse at the Vaishvadevya offering, praising the Hotr priest.
2.349.21	They rise from the firm, from the established.
2.349.22	The Atiratra of the rising Vaisvānara is performed.
2.349.23	The Soma-offerings of the rising Vāsuvanara are indeed without loss.
2.350.1	Then these assemblies take place.
2.350.2	This indeed is the assembly of the assemblies, that these Stotras and Chandaḥs are assembled in the middle.
2.350.3	The Stoma and the Chanda are all the deities.
2.350.4	The gods were afraid of death in the world of heaven.
2.350.5	Therefore they approached Prajapati.
2.350.6	Prajapati said to them, "Do not be afraid.
2.350.7	I will lead you beyond that death which is in the world of Svarga."
2.350.8	He placed them in the six-day Prsthya
2.350.9	The seasons are the Prsthas.
2.350.10	The seasons are the year.
2.350.11	The year is death.
2.350.12	Death indeed established them in the Prsthas and united them.
2.350.13	He led them with this thirty-three-fold (hymn) which is not-defined.
2.350.14	He thought, "They have become not-defined."
2.350.15	He defined them with the defined (hymn).
2.350.16	They went on, transgressing the Stotras and the metres.
2.350.17	They went on, transgress- ing the two feet of Death. The reason why these Stotras and metres are in the middle, is that they are in the middle.
2.351.1	Just as one who does not know where to go when a snake is placed in front of him, stands there, so also this is the placing of the foot of death, for the removal of sin, for non-attachment.
2.351.2	Death does not follow him again, he goes to the world of heaven, having destroyed sin.
2.351.3	Having gone to the other end, they were afraid again.
2.351.4-8	He led them to the heaven by means of the thirty-three (gods) which are not mentioned, and he spoke them by means of the mentioned (gods). Then indeed they conquered that death which is in the heavenly world. He who knows thus conquers that death which is indeed in the heavenly world.
2.351.9	These nights are like a pregnant woman.
2.351.10	These nights are like a snake that has swallowed its prey.
2.351.11	If a snake has swallowed its prey, both ends are thin and the middle is thick.
2.351.12	These nights have the form of one who has eaten well.
2.351.13	One who attains prosperity eats well.
2.351.14	We have obtained the best, the most excellent, the most auspicious, and prosperity. Therefore they perform these nights.
2.352.1	Then indeed did Ashada Savya say: "In the very year in which my servant brought me water and rice-gruel, in that very year twenty-four cows with golden necks and golden bells came to me as a gift."
2.352.2	"We do not see those who were without gold," (he said).
2.352.3	These nights are so bright, so full of Brahmanical splendour, so full of energy.
2.352.4	They say, "Those who perform these nights, they ascend to a higher state."
2.352.5	The Stotras of the sixth day of the Prsthya Sastra are beyond that, for the sake of avoiding misfortune, for the sake or non-injury, for the sake o f peace.
2.352.6-10	They rise up with the three-fold (rite) at the morning twilight. Brahma is three-fold. They attain the world of Brahma by means of this (rite). The three-fold (rites) are followed by the three-fold. Therefore a Brahman follows a Brahman.
2.352.11	Many followers of him obtain (the fruit of) his following. He who approaches these nights,
2.352.12	Indeed, this is not the limit of the Gāyatrī metre.
2.352.13	Indeed, it goes to heaven along with the sacrificer.
2.352.14	Indeed, his fame, prosperity go upwards, and he goes to heaven along the path of the Gāyatri. He who knows this.
2.352.15	The Vaishvanara Udayaniya Atiratra is performed.
2.352.16	The Soma sacrifices of the Vaishvanara are performed for the Udayaniya.
2.353.1	This is a two-month-long session.
2.353.2	The prosperity of that is the same.
2.353.3	Indeed, the two months are the prosperity of the Ritu.
2.353.4	The Ritu is the prosperity of the year.
2.353.5	They desire the year, they desire the year when they perform sacrifices, when they sit in a Sattra.
2.353.6	For there is nothing outside the year.
2.353.7	The nights are indeed sovereignty, the twenty-five nights, twelve nights beyond and twelve nights before.
2.353.8	And what is in the middle of the day is the sovereign, that is heaven.
2.353.9	They go to the highest heaven of Brahman, they go to the sovereignty of Brahman.
2.353.10	They are not followed by others.
2.353.11	These nights are completed, indeed, in the Jagati metre.
2.353.12	The Jagati metre is cattle.
2.353.13	This sacrifice is cattle-yielding.
2.353.14	They go to Viraj.
2.353.15	They go there to the sovereignty and lordship of food.
2.353.16	The Viraj is one less than the Viraj. Since she is born from that, it is the generation.
2.353.17	The Gāyatrī is accomplished through the Upasads and the Soma sacrifices.
2.353.18	The Gâyatrî is the breath; thus this sacrifice becomes life-giving.
2.353.19	The Gâyatrî is splendour; thus they become resplendent and lustrous.
2.353.20	The Gāyatrī is the eldest; in the eldest they establish themselves.
2.354.1	This indeed is the firm essence of the year, that this is the twenty-five-night (rite).
2.354.2	For this indeed is made in the form of the whole year.
2.354.3	These two Atiratras, these two are the first two days of the great sacrifice, these two are Pratiprastha and Visvajit, these two are Svarasama, this is the Visuva.
2.354.4	Those who think that they have begun the sacrifice according to their desire, they should perform this twenty-five-day sacrifice.
2.354.5	Having performed this sacrifice, they rise.
2.354.6	Now, indeed, this sacrifice of twenty-five nights is the same as the human being.
2.354.7	Ten fingers, ten toes, four limbs, and the body are the twenty-five parts of a human being.
2.354.8	These are the six joints, these are the six, these are the four, and the body is the twenty-fifth.
2.354.9	These are the twelve Parisaha (sacrifices). The Atma is the twenty-five.
2.354.10	They indeed make the man (Atman) and generate the man.
2.354.11	They say, "Those who perform this twenty-five-night sacrifice ascend to a superior state."
2.354.12	Now, the reason why the Pañcadaśa-stoma is performed after the Prāgvaṃśa Sadaha is that it is for the sake of avoiding misfortune, for the sake of welfare, for the sake peace.
2.354.13	They rise from the Mahavrata day. The Mahavrata is food; thus they attain the food and the prosperity of the Udayaniya Sadaha.
2.354.14	The Udayaniya Atiratra is performed.
2.354.15	The Soma-pressings are the rising of the all-pervading fire.
2.355.1	This is a two-month-long session.
2.355.2	The prosperity of that is the same as this.
2.355.3	For the two months are the prosperity of the seasons.
2.355.4	The season is the prosperity of the year.
2.355.5	They desire the year, they desire the year when they perform sacrifice, when they sit in session.
2.355.6	There is nothing outside the year.
2.355.7	The thirty-three nights are indeed the self-sovereignty, the sixteen days after that, and the sixteen before that.
2.355.8	And what is the day in the middle, that is the self-sovereign, that is the heavenly world.
2.355.9	They go to the expanse of the sun, they go to self-sovereignty.
2.355.10	That is not followed by others.
2.355.11	Those nights are completed, indeed, it is Viraj.
2.355.12	They attain lordship over food and drink.
2.355.13	Three and Viraj.
2.355.14	Those three divine coverings, their power is this, the three metres, the three sacrifices, the three breaths, the three worlds.
2.355.15	Whatever is thrice thrice of that, that is the prosperity of all, that is the attainment of all.
2.355.16	Indeed, this is a divine sacrifice, namely, this Trayastrimsa (rite).
2.355.17	The Trayastrimsa deities are thirty-three.
2.355.18	The deities who desired prosperity performed austerities.
2.355.19	They saw this path.
2.355.20	They followed it.
2.355.21	Then they succeeded in one day, in half a day, in one day, and in one day.
2.355.22	That indeed is the most successful of the gods, the most meritorious of the worlds, in which these gods succeeded.
2.355.23	"May we succeed in that which is the most successful among the gods, the meritorious among the worlds, in that which these gods have succeeded."
2.355.24	Therefore they perform these nights.
2.356.1	Then there are these five days. The five are the Victories.
2.356.2	By means of the five Vyāhṛtis, the gods conquered. As much as the gods conquered, by that much we conquer.
2.356.3	The sacrifice is fivefold.
2.356.4	We attain the extent of the sacrifice.
2.356.5	Animals are fivefold.
2.356.6-9	"As much as is the measure of cattle, so much are our cattle enclosed, may they stand by us." "As much as is measure of food, so much is our food enclosed, may it stand by us." Then the Kapeyas said, "This six-day (rite) is indeed established in the non-ritual. The five-day (rite), however, is established in the ritual."
2.356.10	Spring is the first of the seasons, summer the second, the rainy season the third, autumn the fourth, winter the fifth, and the cold season the sixth.
2.356.11	This is the best of the seasons, namely, winter, which is rich, having plenty of food.
2.356.12	The five-day period follows it.
2.356.13	Now this is the very same as the one called Parichaksya, which is the one with the cold and the thin man.
2.356.14	The six-day (rite) stands after that.
2.356.15	The autumn is the best of the seasons, and they stand after its firm foundation.
2.356.16	Therefore they perform this five-day (rite).
2.356.17	The Prāyaniya Atiratra is dedicated to Vaisvānara.
2.356.18	The Soma-offerings are indeed dedicated to Vaisvânara.
2.357.1	Now these are the Stoma-offerings called Jyotis, Gau, and Ayus.
2.357.2	These indeed are the auspicious, peaceful, and suitable Stoma-offer ings, namely, Jyotis, Gaur, and Ayus,
2.357.3	and those who have not been praised by the auspicious, peaceful and suitable Stoma offerings.
2.357.4	They have attained Viraj.
2.357.5	They begin with Viraj, the food.
2.357.6	They should not let it go to the end.
2.357.7	The Sāman songs Brihat and Rathantara are used.
2.357.8	That is the prosperity, that is the path.
2.357.9	The Sāmans of the Brahman are used in the Śyaitanaudhasa.
2.357.10	"The one who is going to win the race says, "The one who is winning the race is going to win."
2.357.11	If the Rathantara were to be completed on the third day, they would approach the irregularity.
2.357.12	This is the Rathantara, this is the Brihat, this is the Antarikṣa, the Vaikṛta.
2.357.13	These two Sāmans are not equal.
2.357.14	Then indeed the Brahmanas of the past sat down for a Sattra, saying, "This is to be performed."
2.357.15	Vasishtha's son Satyavrata, having eaten Soma, ran away.
2.357.16	They decided to curse him, saying, "How can the uninitiated drink Soma when we are initiated?"
2.357.17	They went to the one-day Vairūpa sacrifice.
2.357.18	He sat down again, silently observing.
2.357.19	They said to him, "Why don't you eat? Why don't you drink?"
2.357.20	He said, "You were performing a Sattra (a long-term sacrifice). Long Soma was indeed your (sacrificial) Soma in the past."
2.357.21	When they perform the Vairūpa rite on the third day, it is for the Satritā (sacrifice).
2.357.22	These two Sāman verses are performed on different days. If the Rathantara Sāman is performed on the cow, it is performed here.
2.358.1	The Hotr should say, "Sing both forms, the Rathantara and the Brihat."
2.358.2	If the Brihat is completed in the Ayus, the Hotr should say "Sing both forms the Brihat and the Rathantara."
2.358.3	If the two Rathantara days were to fall together, they should perform the Sauvarasama at the morning pressing.
2.358.4	If the two Bṛhat days were to fall on the same day, they should recite the Kanva-Rathantara at the midday pressing.
2.358.5	These two Sāmans are the offspring of the Bṛhat and Rathantara.
2.358.6	Now, when they perform in this way, it is for the sake of attaining immortality.
2.358.7	Then there is the Viśvajit Sarvapṛṣṭha Atiratra. The day is dedicated to Prajapati. Prajapati is the entire day and night. We have attained the entire Prajapati. The entire Prajapati has come to us.
2.358.8	They say, "Those who perform this Vishvajit Atiratra attain the superior."
2.358.9	Because they perform it directly for Prajapati.
2.358.10	The three five-day rites that follow are for the sake of protection, for the sake of non-injury, for the sake peace, for the sake tranquility.
2.358.11	The Vishvajit Ati-ratra is performed for the rising of the sun.
2.359.5	But here they describe it thus: Having accomplished the speech of the Ohuṣī on the tenth day, they attain the goal of that speech which is not established.
2.359.6	Whatever form they may think is the Prāyaniya, they should do that there.
2.359.7	We eat the food of the established, the unerring, the firm, the settled speech."
2.359.8	Then there is this Viśvajit Sarvaprstha Atiratra. The day is Prajapati's. The day and night are the whole Prajapati. We have prospered the whole Prajapti. The whole Prajapati has come to us.
2.359.9	They say, "Those who perform this Atiratra of the Vishvajit attain the superior."
2.359.10	Because they perform it directly for Prajapati."
2.359.11	The reason why the five-day rite comes after is for the sake of protection, for the sake of non-injury, for the sake peace.
2.359.12	The Atiratra of Vaisvānara Udayaniya comes.
2.359.13	The Soma-offerings are indeed the birth-places of the all-pervading Vaisvânara.
2.360.1	Now this (Soma-sacrifice) is of three days.
2.360.2	For there are three seasons, and other seasons.
2.360.3	The seasons which are prosperous, and which are not like those which are not prosperous, are the spring, the rainy season, and the winter.
2.360.4	Those who are prosperous, they have not attained.
2.360.5	There are three metres, three pressing-times, three breaths, Prāṇa, Apāna and Vyāna, and these three worlds.
2.360.6	Whatever is threefold, all that is included in this (triad). This is the attainment of all.
2.360.7	These five are beyond the three days, and five are below.
2.360.8	They do not go for the purpose of the five-day rite.
2.360.9	Then there is the Viśvajit, with all the Prstha Stotras, as the Atiratra. The day is Prajapati. The day and night are the whole Prajapati. We have prospered the whole Prajapti. The whole Prajapati has come to us.
2.360.10	They say, "Those who perform this Viśvajit Atiratra attain a better state.
2.360.11	For they are approaching Prajapati directly.
2.360.12	The five Tri-day rites that follow are for the sake of protection, for the sake of non-injury, for the sake peace and tranquility.
2.360.13	The Atiratra of the rising Vaisvānara is performed.
2.360.14	The Soma sacrifices of the rising Vāsuvanara are indeed the Soma sacrifices of the Ahina.
2.361.1	This is a three-month-long session, and the prosperity of that is the same.
2.361.2	The two months which are the prosperity of the seasons,
2.361.3	the season is the prosperity of the year.
2.361.4	And the third month which is the prosperity of thirteen months,
2.361.5	they desire the year, they desire the year, when they sacrifice, when they sit in a session.
2.361.6	For there is nothing outside the year.
2.361.7	The nights are the self-sovereignty, the fifty-one and twenty-four nights beyond that, and the twenty-four nights before that.
2.361.8	The year consists of twenty-four half-months.
2.361.9	This year is surrounded on both sides.
2.361.10	The day in the middle of it is the self-sovereign, that is the heavenly world.
2.361.11	They go to the highest heaven of Brahman, they go to the sovereignty of Brahman.
2.361.12	They are not followed by others.
2.361.13	These nights are completed, indeed, in the Jagati metre.
2.361.14	The Jagati metre is cattle.
2.361.15	By that this Sattra is cattle-yielding. They go to the Viraj.
2.361.16	They attain the sovereignty and lordship of food in Viraj.
2.361.17	The Viraj is one less than the Viraj. Since she is born from that, it is the generation.
2.361.18	The Gāyatrī is accomplished through the Upasads and the Soma sacrifices.
2.361.19	The Gâyatrî is the breath; therefore this sacrifice is for longevity.
2.361.20	The Gâyatrî is splendour; therefore they become lustrous and brilliant.
2.361.21	The Gāyatrī is the eldest; they establish themselves in the eldest.
2.362.1	The Ādityas and the Angirasas competed for the heavenly world.
2.362.2	The Āḍityas desired, "We shall go to heaven first."
2.362.3	They saw this path.
2.362.4	They went by it.
2.362.5	Then the Ādityas went to the heaven of the gods, the Angirasas became inferior.
2.362.6	That indeed is the best of the worlds, the most meritorious of the worlds, to which the Ādityās went.
2.362.7	That is the best of worlds, the most auspicious of worlds, to which those Ādityas have gone. We shall go to that. Therefore they perform these nights.
2.362.8	The Vaisvānara Prāyaṇīya Atiratra is performed.
2.362.9	For the Soma sacrifices of the Ahina series are concluded with the Vaisvānaran.
2.363.1	Then there are the Jyotiragaurayu stomas.
2.363.2	These are the auspicious, peaceful, and suitable stomas, namely, Jyotiragauraya.
2.363.3-9	Those who are peaceful, those who are tranquil, those who are beneficial, they have not sung with them. They have attained the Viraj. They begin the Viraj, the food. The Brhat and Rathantara are the Sama-s. That is the prosperity, that is the path. The Shyaitanaudhasa and Brahmasama are the Sama-verses. "The one who is in the forefront of the race, the one who is in front of the race, he says, "The one who is the foremost of the race, who is in front, he is the one who is the most excellent of the race, who is in front."
2.363.10	Then there are these six Atiratra (sacrifices).
2.363.11	There are six kinds of evil in man: sleep, idleness, anger, hunger, desire for gambling, and desire for women.
2.363.12	They remove them by these (sacrifices), they cross them.
2.363.13	Then there are these three Tri-days.
2.363.14	Nine days.
2.363.15	There are nine vital airs in man.
2.363.16	This is the union of the vital airs, the prosperity of the vital airs.
2.363.17	Now this is the tenth day, the Vaimāntaka (day).
2.363.18	The navel is indeed that, and that is the day of the unseen, appointed among these days.
2.363.19	Because it is the most excellent of these days, and is appointed to these days, therefore the navel, being the most excellent, is appointed to the vital airs.
2.363.20	For they follow it from the out-breathing, and from the in-breathing.
2.363.21	This is the tenth of these days, the Viraj consisting of ten syllables.
2.363.22	Food is Viraj. It is for the securing of food.
2.364.1	It becomes the Viraj-back-verse. Food is Viraj; it is for the securing food.
2.364.2	It is the Uktha-verse. The Uktha-verses are cattle. Cattle are food. It is for securing food in abundance.
2.364.3	It becomes sixteenfold. The sixteenfold is the thunderbolt, food is Viraj. By the thunderbolt they grasp food.
2.364.4	It becomes twenty-onefold. Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun are twenty-one.
2.364.5	This is the divine kingdom.
2.364.6	The king is the giver of food.
2.364.7	He who is the giver of food, may he give us food.
2.364.8	Then these four Triyas (tri-day sacrifices) are performed for twelve days.
2.364.9	There are twelve full-moon days in a year.
2.364.10	This is the full-moon day of the full-moon days, the prosperity of the full-moons.
2.364.11	Then this is the Pañcadaśa (fifteen-day) sacrifice.
2.364.12	The back is indeed prosperity, the back is indeed radiance.
2.364.13	They ascend the back, prosperity, radiance.
2.364.14	They become those who have performed the Sattra.
2.364.15	Then these four additional three-day sessions follow, making twelve days.
2.364.16	There are twelve new-moon days in a year.
2.364.17	This is the prosperity of the new-moon days.
2.364.18	These twelve days are the ones beyond the six-day Prsthya. Twelve are the ones before.
2.364.19	Therefore, the full-moon and new-moon days of the year are alternating.
2.364.20	The Atiratra of the Vaisvnaras is the one to be performed at the end.
2.364.21	The Soma sacrifices of the Vaisvanaras are indeed without loss.
2.365.1	The Adityas and the Angirasas competed for the heavenly world.
2.365.2	Those Ādityas went to the heavenly world first.
2.365.3	Those Angiras desired, "We too should go to that world which the Ādityas have gone to."
2.365.4	They drove them away from every direction by which they went.
2.365.5	They drove them back for forty years.
2.365.6	They saw this path.
2.365.7	That was the same as before.
2.365.8	It was as if it were of a certain kind.
2.365.9	Then the Angirasas went to that world which the Adityas had gone to.
2.365.10	That indeed is the best of worlds, the most meritorious of worlds, which the Angirasas had gone to.
2.365.11	Those who are the best of the powerful, who are the most meritorious of the worlds, to whom the Angiras went, we go to them.
2.366.1	Those who are the rising rays of the sun are the Adityas, and those who are the southern rays are the Angiras.
2.366.2	Those Adityas and Angiras have the same world.
2.366.3	He who knows this becomes equal to the Angiras and the Adityas.
2.366.4	Then there are two three-day periods, making six days.
2.366.5	There are six seasons.
2.366.6	They find support in the seasons.
2.366.7	Then there is another two three-day period, making six days.
2.366.8	They are established in the seasons in the order of their names.
2.366.9	Then there are these six Atiratra sacrifices, as described in the Brahmanas.
2.366.10	Then there is this three-day sacrifice, as described in Brahmanas.
2.366.11	There are these four three-day sacrifices, making twelve days.
2.366.12	Twelve months make a year.
2.366.13	Having become the months themselves, they passed the middle of the year and ascended to heaven.
2.367.1	Now these are the twelve-day ones. The praise of the twelve-day rites is not yet completed.
2.367.2	Now they perform the metres increasing by four.
2.367.3	The ascending steps of speech are increasing by four.  
2.367.4	They ascend speech.
2.367.5	Now, cattle are four-footed.
2.367.6	Therefore, they offer these metres with four extra syllables, for the purpose of securing cattle with four feet.
2.367.7	Then they offer these metres which are separated by two syllables.
2.367.8	Those with four extra syllables and separated by two syllables.
2.367.9	As long as one does not attain lordship over bipeds and quadrupeds, one does not attain prosperity.
2.367.10	Therefore, when they offer these offerings at intervals of two and four, it is with the intention of attaining lordship over bipeds, quadrupeds, and animals.
2.367.11	Then they offer these eight intermediate oblations, each at an interval of four, all of them. The four directions and the four intermediate directions, and the world above them, on all these directions they establish themselves, and go to the heavenly world.
2.367.12	Then there are these five Sāman-s of the Sāman-junctions: Rathantara, Jarābodhiya, Śrudiya, Nānada, and Gaurīvita.
2.367.13	This is the one known Sāman-of-the-Sāman-junction, namely, Rathantara. Because it is the one known.
2.368.1	It is not praised by the one known Sāmā.
2.368.2	Now, indeed, the Rathantara is speech, the Asvina is speech. Speech is worthy of being divided from speech. This speech is worthy of being separated from speech.
2.368.3	This, indeed, is the second known (verse) that we have to join, namely the one beginning with Jarabodhi.
2.368.4	Since this is the second known verse that we have to unite, therefore it is not praised.
2.368.5	Now the one beginning with Shrudi is famous.
2.368.6	The Sama-vṛkti is the Sāmanī of the Sāman.
2.368.7	"That by which we have performed the Sāmanīs of the Sāmans, may our cattle stand in the world of this Sāman, which is in accordance with the world."
2.368.8	Then the Lokavatī Sāmanī, which is like the Nānada-gaura, may stand in a greater world for us.
2.368.9	They say, "One should chant the Asvins three times." The speech is threefold.
2.368.10	These three worlds are threefold.
2.368.11	If one were to chant the Asvins at the Atiratra, it would be a stretching of the speech.
2.368.12	One should tell the Hotṛ, " Chant the Asvins at other Atiratras. One should chant the Asvīns three times." From the end, from the middle, from the rising.
2.368.13	Now, indeed, the Asvins are prosperous when they are accomplished with Rathantara.
2.368.14	If they are accomplished with one, then Rathantara is at the end, in the middle, and at the beginning. If with two, then Rathantara at the end, middle, and beginning. If with three, then Rathantara only at the end, the middle, and the beginning. It is not accomplished with four, nor with five.
2.369.1	Now these are the black-spotted ones.
2.369.2	These nights are called the Enyas.
2.369.3	In them, the black one is for the sake of procreation and reproduction.
2.369.4	He who knows this is born with a mate.
2.369.5	One should approach him from the front or from behind.
2.369.6	If one approaches him from the front, one becomes the male.
2.369.7	If from behind, then the male deposits semen in the female for the sake of depositing semen.
2.369.8	Prajapati, indeed, was the first to be created here, seeing no other second.
2.369.9	He thought, "I alone was born first; I am the best. There may be something else here like me."
2.369.10	He looked around.
2.369.11	He saw something else, greater than himself, standing above him.
2.369.12	He asked, "What are you?" "What are you?"
2.369.13	He said, "I am Brahman."
2.369.14	He said, "We were born first. We are the best. Let us unite together. Let us be together."
2.369.15	He said, 'No.'
2.369.16	'You are seized by sin.'
2.369.17	'Where is that sin of mine?'
2.369.18	'It is on your head.'
2.369.19	"Do you take him?"
2.369.20	"So be it."
2.369.21	He took him.
2.369.22	He struck him with a sword on the neck.
2.369.23	He pressed him down.
2.369.24	"This is like taking a captured one."
2.369.25	He took (the man).
2.369.26	He struck him on the neck with a sword.
2.369.27	He pressed (him) down.
2.369.28	"It is like taking a captive."
2.369.29	He took 
2.369.30	He cut it with a knife at the ankles.
2.369.31	He pressed it together.
2.369.32	It was like a seized (animal).
2.369.33	He struck it down.
2.369.34	He stood on it with his foot.
2.369.35	He stood upon it with his foot
2.370.1	That is the same as the lifting of the foot.
2.370.2	He cut it into three parts.
2.370.3	He cut into three parts
2.370.4	That very thing became his prosperity, the cow, the third dream, the third shadow.
2.370.5	Therefore these are the most excellent of these.
2.370.6	The most excellent animals, the shadow sleeps.
2.370.7	He thought, "He who told me about this sin, I will cut him off."
2.370.8	This very Brahman he divided into eight.
2.370.9	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
2.370.10	Brahma is the Gayatri.
2.370.11	Brahma himself divided it into eight parts.
2.370.12	He removed it from the eight Trivrit (syllables).
2.370.13	He removed it (further) from the eight Pancadasa (syllables)
2.370.14	He removed it further from the eight Saptadasa (syllabes).
2.370.15	He (the Adhvaryu) removed him by eight (verses) and twenty-one.
2.370.16	He sent him to the other half by eight (verses), twenty-nine.
2.370.17	He cut him off by eight (verses); thirty-three.
2.370.18	This very one is the Atiratra above.
2.370.19	This is the removal of his sin.
2.370.20	Now, indeed, that which shines is indeed Prajapati.
2.370.21	He shines, indeed, free from sin.
2.370.22	He has no shadow.
2.370.23	Therefore, one should spit and urinate towards the shadow.
2.370.24	One destroys sin.
2.370.25	One should rinse one's mouth after sleeping.
2.370.26	One destroys the sin.
2.370.27	One may kill a cow that has been milked.
2.370.28	He indeed destroys evil.
2.370.29	Those who know this and perform these nights, having destroyed all evil, rise up.
2.370.30	But the animals are indeed the lords of the animals, for the animals are the praises. He indeed destroyed the animals there.
2.370.31	Those who desire prosperity should perform these nights.
2.370.32	These very Brahmanas of the Kurus and Pancalas used to perform this sacrifice for the sake of prosperity.
2.370.33	They were not prosperous.
2.370.34	Their cattle were with their own kinsmen.
2.370.35	Then they used to anoint the cow for the one who had come back from the cow-herds.
2.370.36	Then they gave it to the one who had returned.
2.370.37	Shatayani said, "One should not speak of that which is seen.
2.370.38	When they thought, "May we be the best and most prosperous among those who have cattle and wealth," they performed these nights.
2.370.39	It indeed happens like this.
2.370.40	The Atiratra of the rising Vaisvānara is performed.
2.370.41	The Soma sacrifices of the rising Vāsudeva are indeed without loss.
2.371.1	On the day before (the Upavasatha) they offer the animal to Savitr.
2.371.2	Savitr is the impeller of the gods; they begin the year impelled by Savitr.
2.371.3	For who is able to begin a year without being impelled?
2.371.4	On the next day they offer the animal belonging to Prajapati.
2.371.5	Prajapati is the best of the gods.
2.371.6	They thus gratify the gods with the best.
2.371.7	He who, having worshipped the best, wishes for others, all of them are worshipped for him.
2.371.8	And he who, having worshipped best, wishes for other gods, all of them become his most desired and pleased.
2.371.9	The gods are the best of Prajapati.
2.371.10	Thus they please all the gods.
2.371.11	White, hairy, with a dewlap, with a tail hanging down, with four feet,
2.371.12	What is white and hairy is the form of sheep.
2.371.13	What has a dewlap is the form of horses.
2.371.14	What has hanging ears is the form of asses.
2.371.15	What has its tail hanging down is the form of cows.
2.371.16	What has horns is the form of goats.
2.371.17	This is the form of all animals.
2.371.18	All the animals, by means of their own oblations, gratify the father, Prajapati, for a year.
2.371.19	He, being pleased, gratifies them.
2.371.20	The gods, desiring prosperity, practised austerities.
2.372.1	Indra saw this Ashtka.
2.372.2	He initiated himself in it.
2.372.3	He ate with one (meal).
2.372.4	Because he ate with one ( meal), therefore the Ekashtaka is called Ekashtaka.
2.372.5	Those who know this and are initiated, all of them attain and become equal.
2.372.6	For he became equal.
2.372.7	If they were to be initiated before, they would be initiated in the world of the fathers and would be short-lived.
2.372.8	If they are initiated above, it would be like someone who wants to escape before and attains that or not. That is not so.
2.372.9	They should be initiated on this very eighth day.
2.372.10	Just as one would mount a chariot or a horse, so should one do this.
2.372.11	They ask: "Are the sacrificers going to the south?"
2.372.12	One should reply: "Neither to the south nor to the north, just as the sun is."
2.372.13	For they are neither to the south nor the north.
2.372.14	They are indeed going to the west.
2.372.15	The sun does not move towards the east or the west, but moves sideways.
2.372.16	It moves six months towards the south and six months towards the north.
2.372.17	Those towards the south are connected with the Pitrs, those towards the north are connected with the gods.
2.373.1	They move towards Indra, Prajapati, the divine, the right path, the vessel of truth, the All-gods, the heavenly world.
2.373.2	This (rite) follows the course of his (Agni's) covering.
2.373.3	This (rite) follows in the wake of his covering, and they are released in the wake of its release.
2.373.4	His (Agni' s) is the observation that when the Sutiyas (priests) go to the waning (moon), they attain the waning (moon) as their goal.
2.373.5	One should perform twelve consecrations and three Upasads.
2.373.6	By that one attains both.
2.373.7	They say that one obtains both by means of this.
2.373.8	But if the people who are not pleased with water perform the Avabhrtha rite in the cold season,
2.373.9	it is as if snow is making them angry.
2.373.10	If one were to speak thus to those who have done it thus, then they would say, "It will be so."
2.373.11	Those who are to be initiated should be initiated on the fifth or sixth day after the new moon of Phālguna.
2.373.12	Those who go by the control of the good, saying, "This one went, this one will go," they do not go astray. Those who go by control of the good go to the sun. They attain the goal without injury and without harm. They go to that place where this sun goes. Having gone there, they return by the same path.
2.374.1	The cows, indeed, first performed the Sattra, seeking to obtain food.
2.374.2	They rose up in the tenth month, thinking that they had obtained all the food.
2.374.3	They became the horned ones.
2.374.4	They said to you, "Let us complete all these twelve months."
2.374.5	They went too far.
2.374.6	In the twelfth month, their horns began to grow.
2.374.7	These are the twelve months.
2.374.8	Therefore, even in the twelfth month, those who are performing a sacrifice shave their hair.
2.374.9	Because then they become suitable for cows.
2.374.10	They stood up, saying, "We have obtained the sacrifice," and obtained all food.
2.374.11	Therefore, all these (months) rise in the twelve months, even the two rainy and the two winter months.
2.374.12	For the months are the sacrifice, the months are the conquest.
2.374.13	Those who, knowing this, complete the twelve months, they rise having conquered all food.
2.374.14	For the sacrifice is indeed one's own oblation.
2.374.15	The first two (verses) touch the skin, the second two the flesh, the third two the bones, the fourth two the marrow, the fifth two the fat.
2.374.16	Whatever of theirs is not touched by them, that they touch with the sixth two (verses).
2.374.17	Having become pure, cleansed, and bright, they go to the world of the gods.
2.375.1	Indeed, Prajapati was the first to know this.
2.375.2	He desired, "May I become many, may I beget offspring, may I attain the earth."
2.375.3	He practiced austerity.
2.375.4	He saw this Vaishvanara Pratiraatra, the one for the beginning of the journey.
2.375.5	From that he generated day and night.
2.375.6	He stood for a day and a night.
2.375.7	Now, the reason why the Vaiśvānara Prāyaṇīya Atiratra is performed is that they generate day and night from this (sacrifice) and stand in day and night.
2.375.8	He desired, 'May I be born again!'
2.375.9	From the Prāyaniya Atiratra of the Vaishvānara, he created the three-day (rite). From the Agnishtoma, he created the Jyotistoma. From the Ukthyas, he created the cattle and the night.
2.375.10	From the three-day rite, he created the seasons. He settled in the three seasons.
2.375.11	Now, when it lasts for three days, they generate three seasons from him and they stand firm in the three seasons.
2.375.12	He desired, 'May I be born again.'
2.375.13	He performed this six-day ritual after that.
2.375.14	Those two became two six-day rituals.
2.375.15-17	By these two six-day periods, he generated twelve months, and he settled in twelve months. In that these two six-days are performed, they generate twelve months by these two, and they settle in twelve months. He desired, "May I be born again."
2.375.18	He created these two six-day periods and then stopped.
2.375.19	Those became the four six-day periods.
2.375.20	From those four six-day period he created twenty-four half-months and settled in twenty-four half months.
2.375.21	Now, when these four six-day periods make up twenty-four days, they generate twenty-four half-months. They stand firm in twenty-four half months.
2.376.1	He placed this entire world in himself with the six-day period of the Prsthya.
2.376.2	Now, since this is a six-day sacrifice of the Prsthya kind, they thereby place the entire world in the offspring and in the self.
2.376.3	The Prsthya (days) are indeed the shield.
2.376.4	They indeed stand firm in the shield.
2.376.5	The Pṛṣṭhya (days) are prosperity.
2.376.6	They indeed become firm in prosperity.
2.376.7	The Prrṣṭhya (day) is seniority.
2.376.8	They indeed attain seniority.
2.376.9	The back-parts are indeed brilliance; thus they stand firm in brilliance.
2.376.10	The six-day Abhijit is indeed the body of the animals, and the Pratiṣṭhī is the self.
2.376.11	When they perform the Abhijit and then the Pratiṣthī, they place the man above the animals.
2.376.12	Therefore the man stands above the animals.
2.376.13	The Abhiplava is indeed the root, the Pratiprastha is the top.
2.376.14	When they perform the Abhiplava and then the Pratiprasthya, therefore plants grow from the root and ripen from the top.
2.376.15	These are the five six-day rites.
2.376.16	The sacrifice is fivefold.
2.376.17	They find their place within the extent of the sacrifice.
2.376.18	That month is completed.
2.376.19	The year is the month.
2.376.20	They attain the year through the months.
2.376.21	It has thirty nights. The Viraj has thirty syllables. Viraj is food. They go to that food, established in Viraj.
2.377.1	The Pravargya day comes.
2.377.2-6	The gods went to the heavenly world by the Prāyaniya day. That which is going is the Prāyaniyasa. That it is the Prāyanīya day is for the attainment of the heavenly world. Therefore one should desire to be the officiant of this day, for this is the nearest to the heavenly world. And it is twenty-fourfold.
2.377.7-10	The year consists of twenty-four half-months. They attain the year by half-months. This is the view of some who perform a sacrifice, that they rise after having spent a day and a night, saying, "It is the year of the waters." Those who are like those who have begun to do something at their own will, should rise after having spent this day.
2.377.11	This is the year they attain.
2.377.12	Of it there are three hundred and sixty stotriya verses.
2.377.13	So many are the nights of the year.
2.377.14	They attain the year by the nights alone.
2.377.15	They say, "When they perform the year-long Soma sacrifice, they attain the days of the year, but by what do they attain the nights?"
2.377.16	He would say, "As many as the Stotriya verses of the Prayaniya day, so many are the nights of the year."
2.377.17	Having obtained the nights through the Stotriya of the Prayaniyaka day, they should perform the Soma sacrifice on the days.
2.377.18	That is the Ukthya (Satra). The Ukthas are indeed animals. For the attainment of animals.
2.377.19	It has fifteen Stotras.
2.377.20	There are fifteen nights in half a month.
2.377.21	They attain the year by half-months.
2.377.22	There are thirty praises and hymns.
2.377.23	There are thirry nights in a month.
2.377.24	By months they attain the year.
2.378.1	They say, "The Acchāvāka is indeed like a plough among the Hotr priests. If one performs the Acchāvākasamā after the Acchāvasaka, the Tuṣṭuvants would be like a plough."
2.378.2	His Brahma-sāman is Traikakubha, the Acchāva-sāman Udvasīya.
2.378.3	Traikakubha is indeed strength and virility, the Udvasīya is the entire form of the Prstha.
2.378.4	And in the senses and in that energy, and in all the forms of the body, they rest at last.
2.378.5	That indeed he praised it.
2.378.6	They say that the Agniṣṭoma alone should be performed.
2.378.7	It has twelve Stotras.
2.378.8	Twelve months are a year.
2.378.9	This indeed is the festival of the year, namely, the month.
2.378.10	The Jyestha-parva is the beginning of the year. Thus the year has begun for us.
2.378.11	But the lords are the animals. The animals are the praises, for they go to them.
2.378.12	It should have three Stotras, forty-eight verses, two Pavamanas, and Brahma-saman.
2.378.13	So many are the Stotriyas of the Ukthya.
2.378.14	Those who go to the Ukthya from the Agniṣṭoma attain that desire.
2.378.15	The Agniṣṭoma is the shield, the Hotṛ is the shield, they indeed join the shield with the shield, they stand firm with the shield.
2.378.16	The Agniṣṭoma is prosperity, the Hotṛ is seniority. By seniority they establish seniority. By seniority, they stand in seniority.
2.379.1	They say, "This is like a raft, the Jagatī metre, not for the final destination.
2.379.2	The place of that is the six Stotras of thirty-six verses and the six Stotras with twenty-four verses.
2.379.3	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
2.379.4	The Brihati is the heaven, the world, and the kingdom.
2.379.5	They go to the heaven, the worlds, and the kingdom, being established in the Brihatī.
2.379.6	The Brihatī indeed pervades all these worlds with syllables. With ten syllables it pervades this world, with ten the atmosphere, with ten the yonder world, with four the directions, with two the day and night.
2.379.7	"He who pervades these worlds, may we pervade these worlds with him."
2.379.8	Therefore, they should perform six Stotras of thirty-six verses and six Stotras of twenty-four verses.
2.379.9	Now, the year consists of twenty-four half-months.
2.379.10	They attain the year through half-monthly rites.
2.379.11	They should perform the Pratipada verse "These have flowed forth as Soma" in many forms.
2.379.12	Because many of them are initiated.
2.379.13	They say that the verse "Flow on, O Speech, the foremost" should be used as the first verse.
2.379.14	This is the one with many forms.
2.379.15	In this (verse) are all forms.
2.379.16	There are two verses, because two Sāmans are performed here.
2.379.17	Then one should go to the great path, having joined together, in such a way that the most powerful, strongest, and most capable ones go together.
2.379.18	All the verses of the back-part are recited in the same manner as the calves follow their mother and father.
2.379.19	In these (verses) they say that the Agniṣṭoma Sāman should be chanted.
2.379.20	This Agni Vaisvānara is indeed the year.
2.379.21	The horses of that very one, who are yoked by means of the rule, are the good gods. The horses carry the sacrifice. For the whole (sacrifice).
2.379.22	They say, "Those who omit the Yajñāyajñiya hymn after the Rg verses of the Yajñāya- yajñiya hymn, they indeed approach the sacrifices with the sacrifice."
2.379.23	But those who omit the Yajnāyajñīya hymn in the Rg verses, they indeed stand firm in the sacrifice with the sacrifice.
2.379.24	Therefore, the Yajñāyajñiya should be performed in the same way.
2.380.1	The Abhivarta is the Brahma-sāman.
2.380.2	By means of the Abhivarta, the gods came to these worlds.
2.380.3	That they came to is the Abhivarta's Abhivarta-ness.
2.380.4	And in that the Abhivarta is Brahma-sāma, it is for the coming to of these worlds.
2.380.5	Prajapati is the Abode, the creatures are the metres.
2.380.6	He, Prajapati, moves among the creatures, carrying the embryo.
2.380.7	They praise him in different places with the same Sama.
2.380.8	They pour the semen there.
2.380.9	Therefore he places the semen in many (women) with the same (Sama).
2.380.10	The verses after that are the same, but the Sama is different.
2.380.11	The semen alone, when deposited, generates (the child).
2.380.12	Therefore, the same one gives birth to many.
2.380.13	They praise the same one in different places.
2.380.14	Because they see different things.
2.380.15	The verses are the same, but the Sāman is different.
2.380.16	Those very worlds which they ascend to by means of the Prastara-hymns, they descend to from the other world by means of the Sāman-hymns.
2.380.17	The Rg is this world, the Sāman is that world.
2.380.18	When they go to the other world, they go to it beginning with the Sāman.
2.380.19	If they were to let loose before the equinox, they would be cut off from this world.
2.380.20	Whatever they have come from, they come from that.
2.380.21	If they were to be released before the twelve days, they would be cut off from this world.
2.381.1	They turn around once, looking towards the future.
2.381.2	Therefore, the embryos turn around when being born.
2.381.3	In the past, the Barhīta verses were completed in the fifth month.
2.381.4	They should complete the fifth month by uniting the two metres, the Usnih and the Tristubh.
2.381.5	They should conclude the sixth month by uniting the Anushtubh and the Pankti, leaving one metre remaining.
2.381.6	They should approach the Jagati at the equinox.
2.381.7-12	The Visuvat is indeed the Jagat. They make the Visuvat prosper in its own place. The Chhandas are indeed the world of heaven. They go up to that world of heaven. They say, "Indeed, the Chhandas enter here, when these two are joined together." Where will the present and the future days meet?
2.381.13	All the seven, beginning with four, are to be recited.
2.381.14	Having recited the Gāyatrī in the first day, the Uṣṇīsa in the second, the Anuṣṭubh in the third, and the Brihatī in the fourth, they should complete the five months.
2.381.15	Having recited Paṅkti in the first day and Trisṭubh in second, they should complete six months, leaving one metre.
2.381.16	They go to the Jagati metre at the equinox.
2.381.17	The equinox is indeed the Jagati.
2.381.18	They honour the equinox in its own place.
2.381.19	The metres are indeed the heavenly world.
2.381.20	They go to the heavenly world, ascending it.
2.382.1	They say: "One yokes the metres as if they were not yet yoked, since they are not yet yoked."
2.382.2	They use all of them again and again.
2.382.3	They would have thought that the most energetic hymns were the ones they had chosen, and they would have gone to them thirty-six times.
2.382.4	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
2.382.5	The Brihati is the heavenly world, the kingdom.
2.382.6	They go to the Brihatī, to the heavenly world, to the kingdom, having established themselves.
2.382.7-11	The three hundred and sixty are the three hundred and sixty parts of the year. They say, however, that it is only the thirty-three. The thirty-three are all the gods. They go to all the gods, to all the gods. The three hundred and thirty are the three hundred thirty parts of the year.
2.382.12	Some say that it should be thirty.
2.382.13	The Viraj has thirty syllables, and food is Viraj.
2.382.14	They go to the food and nourishment of Viraj.
2.382.15	Some say that it should consist of twenty-four.
2.382.16	The year has twenty-four half-months.
2.382.17	They go in the year, stopping every half-month.
2.382.18	Some say: They go in twelve.
2.382.19	Twelve months are a year.
2.382.20	They go in the year stopping every month.
2.382.21	Some say they go in six.
2.382.22	There are six seasons.
2.382.23-28	They proceed in the seasons. Some say: There are four Upayas. There are four directions and four-footed animals. They proceed in the directions and animals. Some say there are three Upayas. There are three worlds.
2.382.29	Those who go to these worlds, they go to them.
2.382.30	And they say, "There are only two Upa-tīyas," namely the two verses of Śyaitanaudhasa.
2.382.31	For the two verses of Syaitanaudhasa are the most vigorous.
2.382.32	The sacrificer has two feet for stability.
2.383.1	He who goes back on the path he has started does not attain it.
2.383.2	Now he who goes to him without returning, he alone attains him.
2.383.3	Those who go to the two (sacrifices) return as it were.
2.383.4	They go to the Triṣṭub and Bharata (sacrifices).
2.383.5	The Madhyandina (sacrifice) is indeed Triṣṭub Bharata.
2.383.6	If the Rathantara (sacrifice) were to be there, they would go to the Bharata (sacrifice) in that (sacrifice), the Bharata (being) in the Triṣṭu (sacrifice).
2.383.7	Their verses are not in the Tristubh or Barhaspatya metres.
2.383.8	The metres are yoked according to their places, and they abide in the year without being exhausted.
2.383.9	They say that there are only two verses in the Śyaitan and Upetya metres.
2.383.10	Now indeed, these two are the most vigorous. These two are the paths to the world of heaven, the two Anjasayana (hymns), the Brihat and the Rathantara.
2.383.11	These two Anjasayana hymns are the Shyaitanaudhasa.
2.383.12	Day by day they attain heaven by the Anjasayana.
2.383.13	This is the verse about it:
2.383.14	When a man steps out from the great path, which is common to all.
2.383.15	Having run that race, he is tired and again desires to run.
2.383.16	Thus.
2.383.17	Those who use other hymns are indeed proceeding on the path of truth on the great path.
2.383.18	Those who recite the hymns of Śyaitanaudha attain heaven every day.
2.384.4	Those who have injured her, she, adorned and pleased, praises them. The unknown speech praises them. The unbelievers, the ones who did not give gifts, the ones who were not generous, they have been injured.
2.384.5	Then those who nourish her with those (offerings), she, being satisfied, pleased, and known, speaks her own speech. The faithful ones, having determined the seasons, desired the sun.
2.384.6	It becomes well-known every day.
2.384.7	Indeed, the Udgātṛ should initiate those who are performing a Sattra for the Sattra, if he were to ascend the divine region of the gods.
2.384.8	For those who have ascended to the divine world of the gods do not fear, do not suffer, do not thirst, do not experience distress.
2.384.9	The divine world of the Gods is indeed well-known.
2.384.10	They say: Those who daily approach the well-known (world) are indeed falling away from this world.
2.384.11	If the Rathantara is the day, then they should perform the Pauṣkala on the Bharata day, the well-known one.
2.384.12	They say that all these forms are indeed well-known.
2.384.13	The form of this world is Suvid. The form of the atmosphere is Suvid.
2.385.1	It has seven syllables and a final syllable.
2.385.2	There are seven vital airs.
2.385.3-7	They proceed with their very lives, standing firm in the vital airs. Every day it becomes like a cow-pen. This is the excess of Brahman, namely, the cow-pen. These are the excess days, namely, the days of the Ahirbudhnya. They proceed with the excess of the excess of Brahman.
2.385.8	Every day it becomes a raft for the attainment of the world of heaven.
2.385.9	They indeed cross the space between the worlds.
2.385.10	"They cross all the evils, whatever is ill-sung, ill-praised, and ill-done in the sacrifice."
2.385.11	It has twelve syllables and a Ni-dhanas.
2.385.12	Twelve months are a year.
2.385.13	They proceed in the months, and in the year.
2.385.14	They say, "Those who perform these six days of sacrifice are indeed falling away from this world."
2.385.15	They should perform the Ukthya sacrifice on the sixth day.
2.385.16	This world is the Uktha of man.
2.385.17	They thus stand firm in this world.
2.385.18	That is why they call it the 'bond of the Prāhita'.
2.385.19	The Prāhita is indeed the day and night.
2.385.20	For they move like the Prāhita.
2.385.21	And indeed, when they reach the sixth day, the six days are cut off.
2.385.22	Just as one would join a horse with a bond, so they proceed with this Sāman, joining the six days.
2.385.23	They say, "The Okaniṣṭha (Sāman) is to be performed at the end of the Sattra."
2.385.24	One should say, "No."
2.385.25	"The Sattras are indeed the beginning and the end."
2.385.26	They indeed seek this (Sattra) by this (Sattra), they turn towards this (Sattra).
2.385.27	It would be as if one were to repeat the performance here.
2.385.28	Therefore, this should not be done here.
2.386.1	Svābhānu, the demon, covered the sun with darkness.
2.386.2	The gods and the sages healed him.
2.386.3	They saw these notes.
2.386.4	They touched him with them.
2.386.5	What they touched, that is the nature of the notes.
2.386.6	Now, when these are the Svara-s, they touch the sun with them.
2.386.7	Whatever a man does to the gods, the gods do to him in return.
2.386.8	Now, when these are Svara-s (tones), they touch themselves with them.
2.386.9	There are seventeen Svara-s and twenty-one Visuva (tones).
2.386.10	Prajapati is seventeen, the sun is twenty-one.
2.386.11	They surround the son with the father.
2.386.12	The father is dearer to the son, the son is dearer to his father.
2.386.13	If they were to recite another Stoma here, Agni Vaiśvānara would burn him with his splendor and take away the offspring.
2.386.14	These are the six Svarasāmans.
2.386.15	The six seasons.
2.386.16	They thus place him in the seasons. Therefore he goes south for three seasons and north for three.
2.386.17	It is as if a son were to follow his fathers. Thus it is for immortality.
2.386.18	For a son follows his fathers for immortality.
2.386.19	Now these two, the Viśvajit and the Abhijit, are the strength of the Stotras.
2.386.20	For by strength they have attained the equinoctial point.
2.386.21	They say, "The Stoma-maker has gone astray, for the Stotras go astray when they proceed from the thirty-three to the seventeen."
2.386.22	Having gone to the Abhijit of the Pañcadaśa-stoma in the beginning of the Pañcadasa-stoma, they should go to the Triṃśa-stoma at the end of the Pañcaviṃśa- stoma.
2.386.23	In that they go to the Trimsat-stoma from the Saptadaśa-stoma, the Stoma-makers go to the equal from the equal. They do not suffer any harm.
2.387.1	They say that the Sattra of six days is the Self, and the seventeenfold (Sattra) is food.
2.387.2	If one were to take out the seventeenfold (Stoma) from the sixfold Sattra of the Prsthya (Stoma), one would make food outside (the Sattra). One would be without food.
2.387.3	One should approach from the thirty-three (Stoma).
2.387.4	The thirty-three are all the deities.
2.387.5	All the gods, indeed, attain Prajapati, either by ascending or by descending.
2.387.6	They attain him by ascending, as it were, from the same to the same.
2.387.7	Or (it is) the protection of the protection.
2.387.8	The father is indeed the protection.
2.387.9	Or (the sacrifice) is indeed the ascent.
2.387.10	The father, indeed, is superior to the son.
2.387.11	They are Utkhya (hymns). The Utkhyas are indeed the cattle. For the attainment of cattle.
2.387.12	They say, "This sacrifice is performed in the reverse order, when the Agniṣṭoma and the Viśvajit and the Abhijit are performed, the Agniṣṭomah, the Viṣuvaṇ, the Ukthya and the Svarasāman."
2.387.13	All Agniṣṭomas should be performed.
2.387.14	The Agniṣṭoma is the support, the Viṣuvat is the support.
2.387.15	They join the support with the support.
2.387.16	They grow in strength by strength.
2.387.17	The Agniṣṭoma is the brilliance, the Viṣuva is the brilliance, they thus unite brilliance with brilliance, they grow in brilliance by brilliance.
2.387.18	Then indeed the Kamyakiyas, the owners of the house with pillars, sat down for a sacrifice.
2.387.19	Indradyumna Bhāllaveya then attacked them, saying, "I will praise my son with the Visuvat (hymn)."
2.387.20	They came to the praise of the sixth day of the Prsthya (Satra) with one day.
2.387.21	He said, "Well done indeed that you praised!
2.387.22	But if I had been here, I would have arranged the Visuvat differently."
2.387.23	How, O Blessed One, will you arrange it?" His son said this.
2.387.24	He said, "Having approached the Abhijit of the Prsthya six-day ritual first, I will approach the Svarasama from the Prsthyan six-day ritual."
2.388.1	The Prsthya is the self, the Svarasama is the offspring.
2.388.2	The offspring are beyond us.
2.388.3	We are indeed speech.
2.388.4	Speech is beyond us.
2.388.5	Now, when this Abhijit is between (the two fortnights), it is as if he were to stand between procreation and (its) concealment.
2.388.6	When they perform the Abhijit rite before the last day of the six-day Pravargya rite, it is from procreation that is not concealed that they proceed to offspring.
2.388.7	They are indeed seventeen in number.
2.388.8	Prajapati is seventeen.
2.388.9	Prajapati is the begetter of creatures.
2.388.10	He who is the begetter, by him are creatures begotten.
2.388.11	They are indeed in the Anushtubh metre. The Anushtubh is speech, and speech is the begetter. By the begetting of speech, they are begotten.
2.388.12	They are the Ukthya (satra). The Ukthyas are cattle, cattle are food. One should not be deprived of food and offspring from cattle.
2.388.13	Satyayani said: Ignoring the words of Bhallalayi, one should approach Abhijit.
2.388.14	The six-day Satra which is the Abhijit.
2.388.15	The Stotras of the six-day Pañcadaśa sacrifice are the same as those of the seven-day Pañcadasa.
2.388.16	In the six-day Pancadasa there is only one seventeen-fold Stoma.
2.388.17	In this (six-day) there are three seventeen-fold Stotras.
2.388.18	They indeed generate this Stoma by means of this.
2.389.2	The twenty-first is the most extensive of his worlds.
2.389.3	Twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun, are twenty-one.
2.389.4	He is established in all this here.
2.389.5	He thinks, 'In which he is established in all here, in that all here I may be established.'
2.389.6	Therefore the Vāyavya Anushtubh verse is the first step.
2.389.7	For speech and wind are the two deities who eat this (oblation).
2.389.8	We eat him with those two deities who eat it.
2.389.9	If the wind does not blow, the fire of Agni Vaiśvānara would burn this (world) with its brilliance and would destroy the creatures. The Vāyavya Pratipada is for the peace and non-destruction of Agni Vaiśvānar.
2.389.10	They say, "Those who perform the Vāyavī Pratipada are indeed successful in their life."
2.389.11	Now, that this is the Vāyu-rite, it is indeed the breath which is Vāyu; by the breaths they prosper.
2.389.12	"He goes to the bright one, the bright one comes to me." It becomes bright.
2.389.13	For this is the bright day.
2.389.14	"The foremost of the sweet ones in the heavens." They become foremost in the lustre of Brahman.
2.389.15	Come, O Soma-drinker! Thus it is connected with Soma. By this it is made Pavamana.
2.389.16	O Sparha, O God, to the giver of food! This is Sparha. Food is the giver of food. By this they approach him with food.
2.389.17	He who approaches with something better than him, he rejoices in him.
2.389.18	But he who approaches him with something worse than him, he does not rejoice in him.
2.389.19	Now, the reason why the first verse is in the Vāyavya Anushtubh metre is that it is said, "May he be pleased with us; may we prosper."
2.389.20	But they say, "The first verse should be 'Flow, O Speech, the foremost'."
2.389.21	This speech is spread out, in that these worlds are.
2.389.22	Its foremost shines here, in that yonder sun.
2.389.23	Now, the verse 'Flowing forth, O Speech, thou art the foremost' is a verse of approach; thus they approach him with this verse.
2.389.24	Just as one would seize oneself with oneself, so they seize him with his own form.
2.389.25	The reason why it is said, "Do thou flow forth from the western side," is that the wind blows from the western side.
2.390.1	Svabhanu, the Asura, covered the sun with darkness.
2.390.2	The gods and the sages healed him.
2.390.3	They saw these hymns of the day.
2.390.4	With them they removed his darkness.
2.390.5	Now, when these are recited by day, they remove the darkness of the sun.
2.390.6	Whatever a man does to the gods, the gods do to him.
2.390.7	When these are recited by daytime, he removes the darkness from himself.
2.390.8	The two Pavamānas are at the mouth of the two Bhajas.
2.390.9	They remove the darkness from his limbs.
2.390.10	The Mahādivākirti is the Prstha, the Vikarṇa is the Brahma-sāman.
2.390.11	They remove darkness from his middle.
2.390.12	The Dasastobha is the Bhāsa, the Agnistoma-sāman is the head.
2.390.13	They remove his darkness from the head.
2.390.14	That Aditya is the twenty-one-fold, the equinoctial. His rays are the ones called by day.
2.390.15	In that these are called by day, they surround him with them, they enrich him.
2.390.16	They say, "By what does one attain the heavenly world in the year?"
2.390.17	If one says, "The head of heaven, the limit of earth," then one should say, "It is the Agniṣṭoma Sāman."
2.390.18	"By that one."
2.390.19	That one who shines yonder is indeed the head of heaven. By that one they ascend.
2.390.20	They say, "Those who ascend this (sun) indeed fall away from this world."
2.390.21	The verse is "Pṛthivī's discontent."
2.390.22	This world is Pṛthivī’s discontent. They establish themselves in this world.
2.390.23	The Stobha hymn has ten verses, the Agniṣṭoma Sāman has ten verses. The Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food. For the purpose of securing food.
2.390.24	The gods, however, say that the one who offers the food to another person by means of the head, and who performs the Agniṣṭoma Sāman in these Mūrdhanvatī (verses), is the lord.
2.390.25	Therefore, it should be performed in accordance with the Anushtubh.
2.390.26	Anushtubh is speech, and Daśastobha is food.
2.390.27	The mouth is indeed the speech; thus they place food for the self from the mouth. Therefore it should be in the Anushtubh metre.
2.391.1	The Self is indeed the equinox of the year, the two fortnights are around it. They go with the verse that turns towards the Self and descend with the Prāgātha that turns away from it. Both should be done at the equinox.
2.391.2	They themselves take up the two sides for the fall of the world of heaven.
2.391.3	Therefore, the two sides are taken up.
2.391.4	They say, "Those who perform the six days, the Stotras, the Stomas, the Prsthas, and the Chandas in the reverse order, they indeed fall away from this world."
2.391.5	Now, the six days that are performed after the Visuvat, they are performed in this world alone.
2.391.6	"Today, today, tomorrow, we are here. Today you, today men, where are you going? Where are you? O Indra, in three places is the refuge." The Prastara verses are in the form of a series of questions. They are so because of the continuity of today and tomorrow.
2.391.7	And today and tomorrow they continue.
2.391.8	They live out the year without wasting it.
2.391.9	They say, "O Indra, you have not fulfilled your vow." This is to be praised in the evening form of the day.
2.391.10	Like a father to his sons.
2.391.11	"O Puruhūta, teach us in this world, so that we may live and attain the light."
2.391.12	These indeed are the living beings who attain the light, those who attain the extent of a year.
2.391.13	May the unknown clans not harm us, may the Shivas not come near us.
2.391.14	With you we shall cross the flowing, eternal waters, O hero.
2.391.15	These indeed are the flowing, eternal rivers, the seasons, months, half-months, days and nights, and dawns of the year.
2.391.16	They cross over by means of this.
2.392.1	Vasishtha, the son of Shaky, was thrown into the fire by the Saudasas.
2.392.2	When he was being thrown in, he said, "O Indra, do not bring the sacrifice to the sons as the father does."
2.392.3	This much was his utterance.
2.392.4	Then they threw him into the fire.
2.392.5	Then Vasishtha arrived.
2.392.6	He said, "What did my son say when he was being thrown in?"
2.392.7	They said to him, "O Indra, bring the sacrifice to us, as a father does to his sons." This was all that he said. Then they threw him into the fire.
2.392.8	He said, "I am learning in this Puruhūta, the abode of Yama, to live by the light." If his son had not attained this last half-verse and had not offered it into the fire, he would have lived out his entire life.
2.392.9	He approached the deity that was created by the Kurus.
2.392.10	May those who perform the Sattra prosper with this hymn of praise to my son.
2.392.11	This is the hymn of praise that is auspicious and prosperous.
2.392.12	Those who praise with it become prosperous.
2.392.13	The Stotras Gau and Ayus are for stability.
2.392.14	The Stotra is deficient and excessive for reproduction.
2.392.15	They are the two Vairāja (verses) for the securing of food.
2.392.16	The six-day Prsthya (rite) takes place.
2.392.17	The Prsthya verses are the glory and the height.
2.392.18	They ascend upwards, the glory and the heights.
2.392.19	They are the verses of the metres. The verses of the metres are the animals. For the securing of animals.
2.392.20	The tenth day is (performed). Viraj has ten syllables. Viraj is food. For the purpose of securing food.
2.392.21	This is the Sahasra-manav. Formerly, in the Ati-chanda-sūktas, they recite silently.
2.392.22	Indeed, these are the Ati-chandas-sūktas.
2.392.23	Those who are in the Samvatsara-sad are indeed superior to others.
2.392.24-28	They thus stand firm in their own (proper) place. The Sama is concluded with a single syllable. Speech is indeed a single syllable. They thus complete speech with the tenth day. The conclusion is "go" (cow). The cow indeed is the entire food. For the securing of the entire food.
2.392.29	They say, "The Atiṣṭuta Anushtup should be used here."
2.392.30	"Let us not exceed the speech," thinking this, they chant silently with the Stoma.
2.392.31	Here indeed, this is accomplished by speech.
2.392.32	Therefore, this should not be done here."
2.393.1	They debate whether to abandon or not to abandon.
2.393.2	They say that it should be abandoned.
2.393.3	He who goes to the unliberated, or he who cuts off or destroys.
2.393.4	Those who do not abandon go to the unliberation.
2.393.5	When they abandon the full-moon offerings, it is for the sake of prosperity.
2.393.6	He who offers the full-moon offering, it falls or scatters.
2.393.7	The full-moon offering is the year.
2.393.8	Now, when they omit the Full-moon sacrifices, it is for the sake of avoiding misfortune.
2.393.9	For from the deficient (moon) the seed is shed, and from the deficient (seed) offspring are born.
2.393.10	The year is complete.
2.393.11	When they omit the Full moon sacrifices, they thereby make the world of seed for the sake of propagation.
2.393.12	From the deficient (moon), the vital airs are shed.
2.393.13	The year, indeed, is Prajapati.
2.393.14	These are his vital breaths, namely the Full-moon sacrifices.
2.393.15	When they give up the Full-moon sacrifice, they give up the vital breaths of Prajapati.
2.393.16	The Full-moon sacrifices are indeed the Stoma of the gods.
2.393.17	When they abandon the Full-moon offerings, who is worthy to praise the gods?
2.394.1	If they were to be abandoned on that day, they should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Indra, the lord of wealth, in the morning.
2.394.2	They should offer a cake to Indra, the Rudra-possessed, on eleven potsherds at midday.
2.394.3	They should make an offering of a cake on twelve potsherds to the Aditya-possessed Indra in the afternoon.
2.394.4	These are the vessels of these deities. They do not go to the Savanas by means of the Savanas, nor do the deities go to the Savana.
2.394.5	This is Prajapati, namely, the year.
2.394.6	His breath and out-breath are the full-moon and new-moon days.
2.394.7	When the full-moon and new-moon sacrifices are omitted, then they omit the Prāṇa and Apāna of Prajapati.
2.394.8	They perform this sacrifice at the end of the year, which lasts for twenty-four nights.
2.394.9	Some say that one should omit the full-moon sacrifices.
2.394.10	The full-moon sacrifice is the share of Prāṇa, the new-moon sacrifice is share of Apāna.
2.394.11	The Prāṇa which is outside, they sustain by the Apāna which is inside.
2.394.12	When they release the full-moon offerings, they sustain the Prāṇa which was outside by the Apāna that was inside.
2.394.13	They perform this for twelve nights.
2.395.1	Then Aruṇi said to Asāḍa, the son of Savaya, who was about to perform the sacrifice, "You have been excluded from the sacrifice for a year."
2.395.2	He said, "Do not say that to me. We will come to you after twelve nights."
2.395.3	He then went to him.
2.395.4	Whether one is superior or inferior, one cannot equal it.
2.395.5	The skull is placed differently, without a hole.
2.395.6	Thus do I think of the Hotr.
2.395.7	I think that those who let go (the Soma) have a gap in the year.
2.395.8	And indeed their sacrifice becomes otherwise.
2.395.9	As is the hare, so is the sacrifice.
2.395.10	He who seeks to let go the hare does not obtain it.
2.395.11	Now he who desires to take it without letting go, takes it.
2.395.12	Those who let go desire to let go.
2.395.13	Therefore it should not be let go.
2.396.1	But Kusurbindu Auddalaki said, "It should be let go and not let go."
2.396.2	If they were to give up the sacrifice for today, they would offer it tomorrow after deliberation.
2.396.3	It is not known whether it was given up or not.
2.396.4	If they were to give it up for as many days as there are, they would offer them after the Atiratra.
2.396.5	It is known whether it was abandoned or not.
2.396.6-11	Then indeed Bhallābeya said, "One should let go the hymns." The hymns are indeed offspring and cattle. They let go offspring and cattle. And also as one would let go a shield or a garment. They say, "One should indeed let go." This is indeed Prajapati, the year.
2.396.12	His vital breaths are the joints, the full-moon and new-moon days.
2.396.13	Just as a bellows when blown up smokes, so does this Prajapati smoke the animals, not being released.
2.396.14	When the full-moon and new-moon days are omitted, then they are the limbs of him (Agni), and his vital airs are the joints. They stretch out the joints, lest the year, shining, should injure us.
2.396.15	They urge him forward. On the next day they should perform the Pratipada rite.
2.396.16	It is like a bellows that is blown and then again struck.
2.396.17	They blow the bellows, the bellows is the year, the bellows is sacrifice, the three worlds are the essence, the Brahmanas are the essence, they make it honey.
2.397.1	Then indeed did Siriṇḍa Pāṭalī say, "One should let go on the new moon day."
2.397.2	On the new moon day indeed the gods let go.
2.397.3	"We let go in accordance with the letting go of the gods."
2.397.4	These indeed are the two nights of the year which are fit for sacrifice, namely the full moon and the new moon.
2.397.5	If they were to omit the Full-moon and New-moon sacrifices, they would be deprived of the knowledge for a year.
2.397.6	The Agniṣṭoma should be performed with three stotras.
2.397.7	If the stotras are fewer, then it is omitted; if they are more, then it is not omitted.
2.397.8	Then Nāgārī Janashruti said, "One should perform the Ekātritrika."
2.397.9	The hymns of the former are as if they were the remnants of the latter.
2.397.10	Then indeed, Haruna, the hymns of the two Goayushi Stomas are as if they are the remnants of the former.
2.397.11	Of the two, the one whose hymns are fewer is the remnant, and the one whose hymns exceed is the non-remnant.
2.397.12	Therefore, these two alone are to be offered.
2.398.1	Having taken up the cup, the Adhvaryu runs.
2.398.2	He says, "Come back."
2.398.3	They, having uttered the sound "hiṃ", go out facing east and standing in front of the Āgnīdhra, praise with the vow of all the gods.
2.398.4	They thus inform all the gods, saying, "May it be for us."
2.398.5	They advance towards the east and gaze at the Catvāla. They praise with a Krosa.
2.398.6	When the gods were going to the end, their power and strength departed.
2.398.7	They regained it with a Krosa alone.
2.398.8	Those who attain the end of the year go to the end.
2.398.9	Now, when they praise with a Krośa, it is for the purpose of securing the power of the senses.
2.398.10	Now, the Anukrośa.
2.398.11	When the gods went to heaven in three days, this was their third day, the Vairapa, the irregular.
2.398.12	This is its verse:
2.398.13	The gods, having come together for the Vairapa (day), stood there; that was their irregular (day).
2.398.14	Having cried out, they again ascended and shook off the old bodies.
2.398.15	Thus it is said.
2.398.16	This is a verse on that:
2.398.17	"Those who stood in the assembly, crying out when the appearance was spoiled by the enemy,
2.398.18	They created the divine abode, the Sama Veda. By that, the gods attained immortality."
2.398.19	Thus it is.
2.398.20	When they had reached heaven, the Creator said to his sons, "Do not go away. I shall provide for you here."
2.399.1	He built the city of Vaidadra in the eastern direction.
2.399.2	Its priest was Prachinayaayana.
2.399.3	He built the Adraha city of Vaidadhra in the southern direction.
2.399.4	His southern (direction) is called the Yāyana, his Purohita.
2.399.5	He placed the Vaitaraṇa in this western direction.
2.399.6	His western (direction) is said to be the Yāyana.
2.399.7	He placed Vaitaraṇa to the north in this eastern direction.
2.399.8	His eastern (direction) is the Yāyana.
2.399.9	Those gods said to Vidhata, "If you are going to do this, then you should look at us so that we may go to heaven safely."
2.399.10	He looked at them with this cry.
2.400.1	"Ho! Ho! Ho!" he said to Indra and Soma.
2.400.2	They said, "He has indeed gone beyond us.
2.400.3	"So do thou look after us, that we may not be deprived of a share in this world."
2.400.4	And Indra, with the same cry, deprived them of a share in the other world, saying, "Here is the cry, here is the cry."
2.400.5	Then they settled down in both worlds.
2.400.6	By the cry they went to heaven, by the cry they settled down in this world.
2.400.7	Those who know this, and praise with the Krośa and Anukrośa, they stand in both worlds. By the Krośa they go to the heavenly world, by the Anukrośā they stand in this world.
2.401.1	They praise at the end of the sacrifice, facing the fire.
2.401.2	They thus inform the gods through Agni: "We have performed the sacrifice."
2.401.3	The two fortnights of the vow are on either side of the sacrificial post.
2.401.4	Those who initiate themselves for the year are initiating themselves for heaven.
2.401.5	When they praise with the two fortnights of vow, they place the two sides in themselves for the fall of heaven.
2.401.6	Therefore the two sides are placed in oneself.
2.401.7	They praise with the two breaths.
2.401.8	With the breath in front and with the breath behind.
2.401.9	They say that those who perform the sacrificial rite beyond the prescribed limit, or do not perform it, are successful through the Prāṇāpāna (verses).
2.401.10	Who knows whether they perform it beyond the prescribed limit or not?
2.401.11	When one praises through the Prāṇa and Apāna verses, one becomes successful through the Prāna and Apāna.
2.402.1	One praises through the Śloka and Anuśloka verses.
2.402.2	The verse is recited first, and the anuvāka is recited later.
2.402.3	If one recites with a verse, the merit is obtained by the verse, "May I obtain the supreme."
2.402.4	If one recits with an anuvāka, the merit is from the anuvākas, "May I rise up from the fallen."
2.402.5	One recites with the nihnva and abhinihnva.
2.402.6	The nihnva is recited first, the abhinihnvas are recited later.
2.402.7	They say, "Those who perform the Samvatsara sacrifice ascend to a higher state."
2.402.8	When they praise with the Nihnva hymn, they praise the higher state. They ascend by the Abhihnva hymn.
2.402.9	"Whatever deed we have done here, do not let it be destroyed."
2.402.10	Thus they are pleased with them.
2.402.11	The Angirasas praise the inner assembly with the twenty-six-syllabled Nidhana.
2.402.12	With the lower (verse) they offer the Udumbari to the Angirasas, saying, "May it be mine."
2.403.1	Having made it twenty-five, they praise with the Vrata. By praising with the Vrata of the Chhandas, one does not transgress the Vrata.
2.403.2	O Indra, your tawny locks are tawny, and your tawny ones are tawny.
2.403.3	The bards praise you, the men, the foresters.
2.403.4	"With prosperity, O Indra, eat!" "With prosperity, O Maghavan, O Indra, drink!"
2.403.5	Indra is purified from the three-times-seven.
2.403.6	"Again and again, the three-times seven, again and again, the triple-seven."
2.403.7	This is the only part of his body that is not praised, namely, the buttocks.
2.403.8	They praise him with the part that is not praised.
2.403.9	Those who praise him with this become prosperous.
2.403.10	They say, "For whom is the Parimāda rite performed?"
2.403.11	Just as the autumnal sacrifice is the Uksas, so the Mahāvrata is the Parimāda.
2.403.12	Just as they would cover a bull with autumnal wool, so they cover the Great Vrata with the Parimāds. For the non-exhaustion of the Vrata.
2.403.13	And also because these are like the hair, nails, body hair, and beard of a man.
2.403.14	Now, whatever is around this man, the cow, the horse, the goat, the sheep, the barley, the wheat, that is his.
2.404.1	There are seventy-eight Stotriya verses in the Mahāvrata, thirteen in the Parimāda.
2.404.2	That makes a hundred.
2.404.3	Man has a hundred years of life, a hundred senses, a hundred powers. For the sake of obtaining those senses and powers.
2.404.4	Then these voices are heard:
2.404.5	"The small drum, the gong, the gourd, the crooked one, the one with tawny hair, the one with a tawny head, the one with the tawny body, the one with an arrow, the lute, the one with golden skin, the earth drum, and the arrow struck with a bull's hide, and the one with a hundred strings."
2.404.6	The drums in the sky are heard,
2.404.7	The drums are played.
2.404.8	They say these words: "We have attained the entire speech, the entire speech of all."
2.404.9	When the drum of earth is beaten with a bull's hide, it speaks. The bull is supreme, and speech is supreme. It is for attaining the supreme speech.
2.404.10	The drums in the sky are stretched out. They speak. That very speech in the sky, they attain by that.
2.404.11	The pots go around. This is indeed the visible form of heaven, the head. That very speech of the sky, they obtain by that.
2.404.12	They strike the bow with a hundred strings. Man has a hundred years, a hundred senses, and a hundred powers. For the attainment of those senses and powers.
2.405.1	At the end of the Veda, they make the Magadha and the female companion mate on the right side. For the sake of union and reproduction.
2.405.2	One is born through union, he who knows this.
2.405.3	The Ārya and Śaudra castes, one above the other, are made to exercise on the skin of a bull or on a leather mat.
2.405.4	Of these, the Ārya caste is within the altar, and the Śaudra caste is outside the altar.
2.405.5	They make the Śaudra class subservient to the Ārya class.
2.405.6	The gods and the Asuras competed with each other in this sun.
2.405.7	The gods won it from the Asuras.
2.405.8	When they drive away the Śūdra caste with the noble caste, they win it from their enemies, their rivals.
2.405.9	One of them cries out, the other praises.
2.405.10	He who cries out purifies them.
2.405.11	Now he who praises, he places power and strength in those who are pure.
2.405.12	They run a race.
2.405.13	The race is the highest of great things; for the attainment of the highest of great thing.
2.405.14	They are armed.
2.405.15	The highest is the glow of the armed.
2.405.16	They place the highest glow in themselves.
2.405.17	The full jars are carried around, for the securing of the full (moon).
2.405.18	"Ha! Ha! Ha!" is said, for the securing (of the moon).
2.405.19	"This is honey, this is honey," for the Mahavrata is like honey to the gods.
2.405.20	The supreme is the taste in honey, for the securing the supreme taste.
2.405.21	The gods, the lords, say that the first of the beings, the great ones, are those who sing the Madhu.
2.405.22	They should sing the great ones.
2.405.23	Satyayani said: When there is something, when there is something, then it becomes today.
2.405.24	What is there today?
2.405.25	"This is the great honey." Thus singing, they go around.
2.406.1	Those who sing thus go astray.
2.406.2	The Adhvaryu, reciting the Gāyatrī verse with three feet, sits down in front of the Havirdhāna cart. The Maitrāvaruṇa, reciting the Bṛhat verse with fifteen feet, sits down to the south. The Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, reciting the Rathantara verse with seventeen feet, sits down on the north. The Nestr, reciting the Bhadra verse with twenty-one feet, sits down among the wives. The Udgātṛ, reciting the Rajani verse with twenty-five feet, ascends the Udumbara tree. The Udumbara is food, for food is energy; thus he is secured in food.
2.406.3	He recites over it, "The two feet are Bṛhat and Rathantara, the two feet are Vaivāvata and Vaivarāja, the two feet to be recited are Śākvara and Raivata. The metres are the covering, the Yajus is the spreading, the Sūna and Susada are the seats."
2.406.4	There is a descent for her.
2.406.5	The great heaven and earth have mixed this sacrifice.
2.406.6	May they protect us with their burdens.
2.406.7	Thus.
2.407.1	They all make the sound "hiṅ" only once.
2.407.2	Therefore, a person is born with consciousness.
2.407.3	They make the sound "hīṅ" in accordance with the sound "hīm" of the Udgātṛ.
2.407.4	Therefore, the limbs submit to the Self.
2.407.5	The Adhvaryu chants with the three-fold head and the Gāyatrī metre.
2.407.6-11	This is the head that is restored. Therefore this head is restored. With the verses going away, not returning. Therefore this is the head that goes away, not returning, not returning. (It is) with nine (verses). Therefore this head does not go away and return, does not go away, does not return.
2.407.12	Maitrāvaruṇa chants the Brhat with fifteen verses.
2.407.13	He gives back this arm.
2.407.14	Therefore this arm is given back.
2.407.15	(The verses) are recited in the reverse order, not to be repeated.
2.407.16	Therefore this (arm) is bent and stretched.
2.407.17	He makes three Stisas with fifteen verses.
2.407.18	Therefore this arm of mine is being rubbed from the inside, being rubbed from the outside.
2.407.19	The Brihat is indeed strength, the fifteen-fold is strength.
2.407.20	In that he sings the Brihat with the fifteen-fold wing, therefore this arm is stronger.
2.407.21	Therefore the birds fly around the right wing.
2.407.22	The Brihat is the male form, the Rathantara is the female form.
2.407.23	When they praise with the Brihat here and with the Rathantara here, therefore the man lies down on the right side of the woman.
2.407.24	The Brahman-priest sings with the Rathantara in the seventeen-fold section.
2.407.25	He gives back this arm.
2.407.26	Therefore this arm is given back.
2.407.27	(He does so) with the verses recited in the reverse order, not to be repeated.
2.407.28	Therefore he bends this arm and stretches it forth.
2.407.29	He makes three, seven, and fifteen.
2.407.30	Therefore this arm of mine is bent and stretched forth.
2.408.1	He sings with the auspicious tail of twenty-one (verses).
2.408.2	This is the tail that is given back.
2.408.3	Therefore this tail is held back.
2.408.4	It goes away and does not return again.
2.408.5	Therefore this tail moves back and forth.
2.408.6	It makes twenty-one with three truths.
2.408.7	Therefore this is the tail that is scraped from the front and scraped from the back.
2.408.8	The Udgātṛ recites with the twenty-five-fold self and the royal self.
2.408.9	He thus restores this self.
2.408.10	Therefore this self is restored.
2.408.11	(He does so) with the rays going away, not returning again.
2.408.12	Therefore he moves this self both ways, and carries it forward.
2.408.13	He makes the three Sâtîs (the three Sâman chants) twenty-five.
2.408.14	Therefore this Self is being moved from the present, is being moved from what is to be done.
2.408.15	They approach the Udgātṛ with each of these praises.
2.408.16	The Udgātṛ sings with them.
2.408.17	He assigns the limbs to himself.
2.408.18	Therefore the limbs are assigned to oneself.
2.408.19	He sings the highest praise to himself.
2.408.20	That is why one lies down as if rising up from oneself.
2.409.1	Prajapati, creating beings, slipped.
2.409.2	Therefore the deities departed.
2.409.3	But Indra alone did not depart from the deities.
2.409.4	He said to Indra, "How can I return to this?"
2.409.5	"What do you have?" he said.
2.409.6	"My two breaths, the out-breath and the in-breath."
2.409.7	When he said, "What do I have?" that became the nature of the Stoma.
2.409.8	He who knows thus, he praises him as the best.
2.409.9	He said to him, "Praise him for a year with these two alone."
2.409.10	He, being praised with these two alone, all the deities will approach him above the year."
2.409.11	He praised him for a year only with these two.
2.409.12	All the gods, having praised him with these two (verses), honoured him above the year. They said, "We are taking the essence of the directions, the essence of water, the essence of the Veda, the essence of food, the great vow."
2.409.13	When they said, "We take the great vow," that is why the Mahāvrata is called Mahāvrata.
2.409.14	They gave it to him.
2.409.15	He made it a vow.
2.409.16	They rejoiced greatly, hence the name Mahāvrata-yāti.
2.409.17	Therefore, on this day, they rejoice.
2.409.18	Because the gods rejoiced on this day.
2.409.19	They say that one should approach on the day of the equinox in the middle of the year.
2.410.1	Vrata is food.
2.410.2-5	Or, they say, those who perform the Mahāvrata rite at the equinox in the middle of the year obtain half of the food. The year cooks the entire food. Having performed it above the year, one obtains the entire food.
2.410.6	Then indeed did Janashruti say, "This is a fierce rite, the Great Vrata.
2.410.7	For he who is fierce, he who is in the middle, he who is the protector, he who is fierce becomes the protector, he having driven away all others, sleeps alone.
2.410.8	Having approached after that, one should perform the Upetya rite at the end of the year, for the securing of the entire food."
2.410.9	It becomes twenty-five.
2.410.10	The year consists of twenty-four and a half months.
2.410.11	The food is twenty-five. Thus he places the food on twenty-five.
2.410.12	Just as one would milk a full cow, so he milks the food on twentyfive.
2.411.1	They say, "The Savanīya should be the Prstha of this day."
2.411.2	The gods, when they first performed the vow, became the Tavashavyas.
2.411.3	And in that the Tavasha vyas are the last hymn of this day, they thereby directly perform the vow.
2.411.4	But they say that the Tavas havyas have ill-known hymns, ill-known verses, ill-known invocations, ill-known responses, ill-known deities, and ill-known conclusions.
2.411.5	The Vamadevya is indeed the Prastaara of this day.
2.411.6	The Vamadevya belongs to the self of the vow.
2.411.7	If they were to perform any other hymn than the Vamadevya for this day, it would be as if one were to go to one's house and not find it.
2.411.8	They say that the Svaras are not suitable for the Prastaara.
2.411.9	The Rajana is indeed the Prastara of this day.
2.411.10	By means of the Rajanya, Prajapati attained sovereignty, lordship, and control over his subjects.
2.411.11	By means of that by which Prajapati attained lordship, sovereignty, and control over subjects, may we attain lordship, sovereignty, control over subjects.
2.411.12	The Rajanya is indeed like something hidden from view.
2.411.13	The Rajana is the last verse.
2.411.14	The Vamadevya is the Sama of Maitravaruna.
2.411.15	The Vamadevya with five endings is the Brahma Sama.
2.411.16	They proceed towards the middle of the Self, making it complete with the Vamadevya, which is preceded by the Sama.
2.412.1	It has five Stoma, five-syllabled verses, five deities, five Prastara, and five endings.
2.412.2	The sacrifice is fivefold, the animals are fivefold, the food is fivefold, there are five seasons, and whatever is fivefold, this is the prosperity of all that, this is its attainment.
2.412.3	The Brahma-sāman is called "Vamadevya" with five endings.
2.412.4	For indeed, one praises with fivefold devotion.
2.412.5	It is in the Atichandas verses, in the Trikakud verses, that the text has "The buffalo, the barley-sheaf."
2.412.6	This is because the Atichandas are indeed superior to the other metres.
2.412.7	Those who have the Samvatsarasad are indeed superior to others.
2.412.8	They indeed stand firm in their own metre.
2.412.9	And in the Atichandasa verses it is indeed said, "Here, here," which is the form of the end.
2.412.10	This is the end of the day.
2.412.11	They say that the Ilandam should be sung at this time.
2.412.12	Prajapati gave food to his creatures by means of Ilandam.
2.412.13	By means of that by which Prajapati gave food by means of Ilanda, I shall rise up having obtained food.
2.412.14	It is indeed in the Atichandas verses.
2.412.15	For indeed, the Atichandas are beyond the other metres.
2.412.16	Those who have the Samvatsarasad are indeed beyond the others.
2.412.17	They indeed stand firm in their own metre.
2.413.1	It is indeed in the Vaishvanariyas.
2.413.2	For this is indeed the praise of Vaishvanara.
2.413.3	It is in the Ashtya Aksharas, saying "We shall eat."
2.413.4	The Atichandas verses are like the ocean, like the sky. The ocean and the sky are inexhaustible. We praise them.
2.413.5	It is a bird.
2.413.6	The bird is the vow of this day.
2.413.7	He says, "Vow." Food is the vow. For the attainment of food.
2.413.8	He says "Heaven." For the attainment of heaven.
2.413.9	"This is the auspicious one", he says. Having become auspicious, they attain the heavenly world.
2.413.10	They say, "The Vāravantīya (Sāman) should be performed at this time."
2.413.11	Prajapati created the animals.
2.413.12	They, having been created, fled from him.
2.413.13	He restrained them by cutting the branch of the Vāravantīs.
2.413.14	That which he restrained, that is the Varavantiya-ness of the Varavantiyas.
2.413.15	Therefore they say that restraint is healing.
2.413.16	That which is the Varavantian Agniṣṭoma Sāman of this day, that we have restrained by this rite, may it be restrained for us by the Varavantiyan. May it stand at the end."
2.413.17-22	That is the form of the last (day). For this is the last day. They say that whatever speech does not exceed, that should be the Agniṣṭoma Sāman of this day. For speech does not exceed the Yajñāyajñiya. Speech is the Yajñayajñiya. For how can speech exceed speech?
2.413.23	Therefore, the Agniṣṭoma Sāman should be performed in this rite.
2.414.1	The Vrata is indeed food. The Vrata is indeed prosperity.
2.414.2	Food is obtained by Vrata, prosperity is obtained by Vratam.
2.414.3	They say that one should perform the Vrata after the year is over.
2.414.4	The Vratam is known to be far away from where it is performed.
2.414.5	It is of twenty-five (bricks).
2.414.6	The year consists of twenty-four half-months, food is of twenty-four (bricks), he thus places food on the twenty-five (brick).
2.414.7	For the man consists of twenty-five.
2.414.8	This is the praise of man, they say. There are ten fingers of a man, ten toes, four limbs in front, the self is twenty-five, these are the six joints, these are the seven, these are the eight, these are the nine, the self is the twenty-five, there are twelve nails, there are twelve, the self is indeed twenty-five.
2.414.9-10	They make the man (the sacrificer) fit, they make him procreate.
2.414.11	They should have twenty-five heads, twenty-five other sides, twenty-five tail, twenty-five self. Thus the attainment of the vow is by each limb, we attain the vow by each limb.
2.414.12	Therefore, indeed, the sage Harjji said: "One should praise this hymn in five ways, having divided it into five parts. One should praise the head with five (verses), one flank with five, the other flank with five, and the tail with five, and oneself with five."
2.414.13	Thus, indeed, the twenty-five (verses) do not exceed.
2.414.14	Thus is the attainment of the vow.
2.415.1	Now, indeed, Haruni said, "The limbs are not the same as the self."
2.415.2	The self is not the same as other limbs.
2.415.3	A person is created by the uneven (self), and is the same as the uneven (self).
2.415.4	Thus, one should approach it in accordance with its nature.
2.415.5	The head of the vow is Brahman, the wings are heaven and earth, the body is space, and the tail is the Sama Veda.
2.415.6	The head of the vow indeed is the Gayatri, for that is Brahman.
2.415.7	The wings are the Brihat and Rathantara, for they are heaven and earth.
2.415.8	The body is the Vamadevya, for that is space.
2.415.9	The tail is the Yagyayajniya, for that indeed is the Sama Veda.
2.415.10	They praise the head with nine (verses).
2.415.11	There are nine vital airs in man.
2.415.12	This is the union of the vital airs, the prosperity of the vital airs.
2.415.13	They place the Gayatra-Sama in it.
2.415.14	The vital air is the Gayatra-sama.
2.415.15	They thus place the vital air in the head.
2.415.16	Therefore the vital air is in the head.
2.415.17	They go forth, reciting the verse, "The sun is the head."
2.415.18	The neck is the same as those worlds. When one sings in accordance with them, it is as if one is singing in accordance with the worlds.
2.415.19	One unites one's own self with the cold.
2.415.20	Therefore, the head and the self are united.
2.415.21	They say, "It becomes twenty-five. It exceeds. Therefore, this should not be done here."
2.416.1	They approach the Rathantara with this three-fold Stoma.
2.416.2	Brahma is three-fold, and the Rathantara is food.
2.416.3	They thus obtain food by means of Brahma.
2.416.4	They place the fifteen-fold Stoma on it.
2.416.5	The fifteen-fold is the thunderbolt, and the Rathantara is food.
2.416.6	They take possession of that food with the thunderbolt itself.
2.416.7	They approach the seventeenth with the fifteenth.
2.416.8	The thunderbolt is the fifteenth, the Brhat is the seventeenth.
2.416.9	They touch the Brhat with the thunderbolt itself
2.416.10	They establish the Brahman-Sama in it.
2.416.11	The Brhat is the Kshatra.
2.416.12	They establish the Kshatra in the Vis.
2.416.13	He is born from that Kshatra.
2.416.14	They say, "One should praise from here with Brihat and from here with Rathantara."
2.416.15	"This entire (universe) is indeed like the vital breath, rising up against (it)."
2.416.16	Indeed, Kīji Vākayana said, "Those who praise from here with the Brihat and from there with the Rathantara, they make food in the rear."
2.416.17	The Rathantara is indeed food.
2.416.18	Or he may approach the food from the right side.
2.416.19	Therefore, from here itself, they praise with the Brihatī (hymn) and from here with the Rathantara (hymn) for the securing of food.
2.416.20	The one who is the fifteen-fold Stoma is indeed the one who is the counter-striker.
2.416.21	Therefore, the birds fly around the left wing.
2.416.22	They all come to the one-twenty-first (Stoma) which is the support.
2.416.23	The twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun, are twenty-one.
2.416.24	He is established on all this.
2.416.25	He who is established on all that, he is established on all. They establish him in that.
2.417.1	They sing the auspicious Sama on him.
2.417.2	The auspicious is the offspring.
2.417.3	From the tail are born the offspring.
2.417.4	It is from the tail that they bestow offspring on the offspring for propagation.
2.417.5	There also they say that the good should be done.
2.417.6	The offspring is good for the offspring. The offspring is the good.
2.417.7	He who knows this sees offspring for the offspring.
2.417.8	They say, "One should praise all at once, making it suitable for the young."
2.417.9	When one falls down, all the limbs fall down separately.
2.417.10	When one sits down, all the parts of the body come together and sit down.
2.417.11	When they praise with all (the verses) at once, it is as if when one falls down, the limbs fall down together, separately.
2.417.12	Now, when they approach with each of the praises, it is as if one were to sit down after having brought all the limbs to the self. It is like that.
2.417.13	Now indeed Bhallāyeya said, "On this day, no other Udgātṛ should perform the priestly duties."
2.417.14	This day is indeed prosperity, and the Udgātṛ is prosperity.
2.417.15	If on this day another Udgātṛ were to perform the priestly duties of the Sāman, he should instruct them without being asked, ascend them without being asked; he would be guilty of a sin. He should establish the Vānuparisaṃstha. He should approach each of the Stomas with each of the Sāmans.
2.417.16	But here they say that the Stoma should be completed with twenty-nine verses.
2.417.17	They say, "The Stoma becomes twenty-nine. The cow goes to her own herd. O Janamejaya, the thousand-sacrificer, the bundles of reeds go away. They go away in this way, each one according to its own kind."
2.417.18	The head indeed goes to the head, the wings to the wings, the tail to the tail, the self to the self.
2.417.19	The Stoma becomes twenty-nine. It is indeed so.
2.418.1	The Udgātṛ priest sits on the stool, the Hotṛ priest on the bench, the Adhvaryu priests on the benches. The other priests sit on the benches.
2.418.2	They say, "One should not ascend the stool while being initiated."
2.418.3	Indeed, the day has passed.
2.418.4	Or the tenth day is the same as the Ukthas.
2.418.5	They say that this is the same as ascending.
2.418.6	Indeed, prosperity is associated with the atmosphere.
2.418.7	Thus, prosperity is attained.
2.418.8	The arrow has a hundred strings.
2.418.9	Man has a hundred years of life, a hundred senses, and a hundred powers. For the attainment of those very senses and powers,
2.418.10	They say, "The king should not play the hundred-stringed lute, for when the Brahmanas knew his lineage, he became a single-stringed lute. Now when he enters the assemblies of kings, saying, 'I am that,' what would they do? What if he were not as he was before?'"
2.418.11	They say, "What if he were not now as he was before?"
2.418.12	In ancient times, they used to go to heaven after praising with one Sama. Then one should rise from Avabhrtha.
2.418.13	Thus, the Vana and Shatatantri are for the completeness of speech.
2.418.14	This is his lineage: Bhuḥ, Bhuvaḥ, Svaḥ, Vada, Vada, Veda, Vada, Vadur, Pṛthu, Sugantuh, Karman, Karan, Kara, Karisyat, the speech of Indra, the great, of universal form, "May the god speak a hundred years, saying, 'The one who speaks is the one who is to be spoken to.'"
2.418.15	Then Indra, with that desire, and with the Vetasa branch, writes on the mind, "The mind is light," "Speech is truth," "The mind is good."
2.419.1	The sons of Ahīna-Saṃha, having approached Ashvatthi, said, "O venerable one, please instruct us in the sacrifice."
2.419.2	He said, "Do not say so.
2.419.3	The year is difficult to approach.
2.419.4	Just as the spokes are fixed in a chariot, so all the deaths are fixed in the year.
2.419.5	And they said this to him.
2.419.6	They said, "You are indeed our physician, you are our atonement. Do instruct us."
2.419.7	That was his dear (wish).
2.419.8	He said, "If you say this, then we will be established in the six foundations."
2.419.9	We have come to you from the six rivers.
2.419.10	We have ascended the four-wheeled one, the one who crosses over.
2.419.11	We have come to the paths of the heavenly world, the ones leading to heaven.
2.419.12	We have covered the entire year, the time of the great flood.
2.419.13	We have joined the divine couple.
2.419.14	Do not be deprived of the benefits from the clear path.
2.419.15	Do not let the imperishable sacrifice slip away.
2.419.16	We have approached the sacrifice, the morning sun.
2.419.17	We have approached the truthful speech.
2.419.18	You have approached the best of the two worlds, the prosperity of the northern direction.
2.419.19	You have stood in the heavenly world.
2.419.20	You have come from the village to the forest.
2.419.21	You have emerged from knowledge.
2.419.22	You have performed the divine marriage.
2.419.23	You have been approached from the sacrifice.
2.419.24	These (verses) indeed instructed him.
2.419.25	They said, "Do not instruct us in this way, as if from a distance."
2.419.26	"Instruct us so that we may understand this."
2.420.1	He said, "What I told you, that you should be established in the six foundations, and that you should not deviate from the Pavamāna-faced (verses), that is what I told you."
2.420.2	This indeed is the foundation of the Sama-veda, that is the Nidhana.
2.420.3	These six Nidhanas are connected with the six seasons, the year.
2.420.4	Just as one would climb a tree by means of steps, so do they go to heaven by means of these Nidhanas of the Sama-Veda.
2.420.5	Therefore, the Nidhanas should not be omitted from the Pavamana hymns.
2.420.6	Then what I said to you, O six Haritmati (s), is the same as the Ida-declension. I said to you: "You should begin with the Brihatis." That is the same as saying: "You should start with the Ida-s."
2.420.7	These are the six Haritmati-s.
2.420.8	Just as one who has yoked six horses to a chariot goes wherever he wishes to go, so do they attain heaven through these Iḍā-declensions.
2.420.9	Therefore, one should begin with the Iḍā-verses and the Brhatī-verses.
2.421.1	Then what I said to you, 'He mounts the four-wheeled chariot that crosses over,' that is the Soma, flowing for the gods, pour out the Soma for the god-loving. The Soma-drinking ones, purifying, Soma, the holder of Soma. These are the four Brihatis that I told you.
2.421.2	This indeed is the four-wheelled chariot that crosses over, namely these Brihatis.
2.421.3	Just as one would go to the place one wishes to go by a chariot with four wheels, in the same way, they go to the heavenly world by these Brihatis.
2.421.4	And this indeed is the chariot of the gods.
2.421.5	Just as one would go by the well-yoked chariot of the gods to the place one desires to go, in the same manner, they go to heaven by these Brihatīs.
2.421.6	Therefore, these alone should be performed.
2.421.7	And what I said to you, "The path to the heavenly world is the Aushanas and the Kavasas," that I said to you.
2.421.8	Indeed, this is the path to the heavenly realm, the Aushanas, and the Kavas.
2.421.9	Aushana is in front, Kava is above.
2.421.10	Those two, the father and the son, are the two who have made the boat.
2.421.11	Just as the father and the two sons have made the boat to reach the other shore safely and without mishap, in the same way, the two, Oshanaka, reach the goal safely and without mishap.
2.421.12	Therefore, one should release the two, Oshaṇaka.
2.422.1	Now when I said to you, "You should cross over the entire year," I meant that you should cross over the Pavamāna (Sāman) and the floating (Sāman).
2.422.2	This indeed is the entire year, namely, the seasons, the months, and the junctions of the seasons.
2.422.3	They say that the seasons, the months, the junctions of the seasons, and the day and night are the same.
2.422.4	The day and night are indeed the extent of the year.
2.422.5	That is the raft.
2.422.6	A cow floats, an elephant floats, a man floats. A raft does not float.
2.422.7	This is the extent of the year, which is covered by this floating (raft), which is not flooded.
2.422.8	They say, "There is a floating raft, which is not flooded." They criticize it.
2.422.9	He who is defeated and he who is defeated, they call him "not floated."
2.422.10	It should be done as a floating raft.
2.422.11	It has one syllable as its end.
2.422.12	Speech has one syllable.
2.422.13	Speech is the entire Brahman.
2.422.14	With this entire Brahman, just as one would cross over thorns by covering oneself with leather, in the same way, they cross over the entire year by covering it with the (sacrificial) year.
2.422.15	And just as one would walk over hot ashes by wearing shoes, in the same manner, it is.
2.422.16	Therefore, it should be done only in the reverse direction.
2.422.17-18	Now when I said to you, 'You have approached the divine pair,' then I said to you by means of the Gayatri, 'The high one has been born from the most delicious and most intoxicating (mixture).' This is the divine pair, namely these two, the Gayatri. 'The high one' is the male form, 'the most delicious' is the female.
2.422.19	This pair is generated.
2.422.20	He who knows this is born through the pair.
2.422.21	Therefore, these two should be performed.
2.423.1	And what I told you, 'Do not fall from the prosperous caravan,' that I told you in the Brihat and Rathantara alone.
2.423.2	For this is indeed the prosperous caravan, namely the Brihat and the Rathantara.
2.423.3	These indeed are the forest-paths which lead beyond the Sāman-paths.
2.423.4	This is the Trivrt stoma.
2.423.5	There is a higher path. This is the Pañcadaśa stoma.
2.423.6	Here is a higher path, this is the Saptadaśa stoma
2.423.7	Here is a still higher path, this the Ekavimśa stoma,
2.423.8	One should go to it when tired, this is the Trinava stoma.
2.423.9	The three-and-thirty verses are recited with the syllable "āsa."
2.423.10	Now, as to why the verses of the Chandas are recited in one or two (places) only.
2.423.11	The two verses, Brihat and Rathantara, are the Kshatra of the Samans.
2.423.12	The Kshatriya is the leader of the forest.
2.423.13	Now, when the warrior goes to the forest, he who knows him there, whatever is there, whether honey or mead, that becomes manifest to him.
2.423.14	And those others who are lost, who are enemies, who are far away, they enter the thickets and the forests.
2.423.15	Just as one would be afraid to cross a forest with a Kshatriya, so they cross the Bṛhat and Rathantara (Samans).
2.423.16	And this indeed is the path of the gods, namely the Pañcadaśa (Stoma) of the Pañcadaša (Stoma) is the path of heaven.
2.423.17	The gods having gone to this heavenly world by this path of heaven, were afraid of the coming of men.
2.423.18	They said, "Let us know how men may not come to us."
2.423.19	They drove away the demons with these sacrifices.
2.423.20	When one is consecrated, when one is bound, they do this.
2.423.21	They lead it to the Brihat and Rathantara.
2.423.22	Those whom they kill are blind. Those whom they release in the Brihat and Rathantara are blind.
2.423.23	Therefore one should not release in the Brihāt and Rathantara.
2.424.1	Then indeed Nāgārī Janashruti said, "The movement of a wolf is like the movement of a snake."
2.424.2	"Who is the wolf?"
2.424.3	"Prajapati."
2.424.4	"Who Prajapati?"
2.424.5	"The year."
2.424.6	What is his crawling?
2.424.7	The day and night.
2.424.8	Which are the day and night?
2.424.9	The Brihat and Rathantara.
2.424.10	He crawls on these two.
2.424.11	They are the day and the night, the divine pair.
2.424.12	They start from the foot of the year.
2.424.13	They attain the goal, unharmed and well.
2.424.14	And what I said to you, 'Let not the sacrifice be interrupted,' that I said to you as Vamadevya.
2.424.15	For this indeed is the continuity of the sacrifice, namely Vamadevya;
2.424.16	for Vamadevya is the breath.
2.424.17	'Let us not interrupt the breaths.'
2.424.18	Now, when I said to you, "The sacrifice is like a cow, and its milk is like the milk of a cow," I meant that.
2.424.19	For this is the milk of the sacrifice, namely, the milk of a milch cow. The milk of the sacrifice is the progeny, the milk of the progeny is the cattle, the milk of cattle is heaven.
2.424.20	Just as a farmer would say, “We will go to the village, we will cross the river, we will stay in the house,” so these two, Gauriviita and Udasa, wander, seeing the end of their lives.
2.424.21	And just as the Soma-reciter would say, “Soma is being offered,” so these two Gauriviita aud Udasa offer Soma to the gods.
2.424.22	The Soma-sacrifice is performed on the day on which the cow is let loose.
2.424.23	The gods look at him and say, "Run, tomorrow you will sacrifice."
2.424.24	If they do not let loose the cow on the same day, they think, "We will not let down the gods."
2.425.1	Now, when I said to you that the speech is true, it is the same Anushtubh verse that I said to you.
2.425.2	This is indeed the true speech, the Anushtubh.
2.425.3	The Anushtubh comes first, the Gāyatrī comes next.
2.425.4	The Anūṣṭhūb is speech, the Gāyatri is the vital breath.
2.425.5	This indeed is the truth of speech, namely, the breath.
2.425.6	This indeed is the speech which is true.
2.425.7	And just as one would worship two new wheels, so they take this Anushtubh in the three-day-long rites for the attainment of the world of heaven.
2.425.8	Therefore this Anushtubha alone should be performed.
2.425.9	Now when I said to you, "Join the most excellent ones in the contest," I meant the Agniṣṭoma Sāmans.
2.425.10	For these are the most excellent ones who are joined in the contest, namely, the Agniṣṭoṃa Sāmans. Those are the days which are called "the eyes."
2.425.11	Now when I said to you, 'You have attained the highest prosperity,' I meant your back-parts.
2.425.12	For this is the highest prosperity, namely, the back-parts. The Trivrit, the Pañcadaśa, the Saptadaśa, the Ekavimśa, the Trinava, they go out from the Trayastrimsa.
2.425.13	Now, when I said to you, 'You will stand in the world of heaven', I meant the Yajñāyajñiya (Sāman) is your Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
2.425.14	This indeed is the world of heaven, namely the Yajñayajñiya. This is the Aditya (Sāman), consisting of twenty-one verses.
2.425.15	They stand at the end in that world of heaven.
2.426.1	Now when I said to you, "Let us go from the village to the forest," I meant that you should not be envious of the songs that are to be sung.
2.426.2	Just as one would go from one village to another without fear, so also one should go from the Agniṣṭoma songs.
2.426.3	Now, just as one who has been pricked by a thorn or a splinter comes from the forest to the forest, and then says, “I have been pricked by this much, I have been pierced by this much,” so too, the Āhārīya Sāmans.
2.426.4	Therefore, the Āharyasāmans should be destroyed.
2.426.5	Then what I said to you, 'I am born from knowledge', that I said to you as a well-known fact.
2.426.6	Then what I said to vou, 'I am from the divine marriage', that I said as a well-established fact.
2.426.7	Now when I said to you, 'I know this from the sacrifice,' I meant, 'May your faith not fail.'
2.426.8	This indeed is the queen of the gods, namely, faith.
2.426.9	She stands here in the morning.
2.426.10	The gods stand by her, saying, 'Wherever she will go, we will go there.'
2.426.11	All the gods follow her, and in the evening they enjoy her.
2.426.12	He enters her, he offers, he sacrifices.
2.426.13	The gods live on that.
2.426.14	He told them this about the year, that it is free from harm.
2.426.15	Those who, knowing this, undertake the year, they indeed attain the goal of safety and freedom from harm.
2.427.1	Indeed, the year is a man.
2.427.2	Man is Prajapati, Prajapati is the year.
2.427.3	They sit here desiring him, having made themselves the sacrifice.
2.427.4	His feet are the Prayaniya and Atiratra sacrifices.
2.427.5	The white part of them is the form of the day, the black part is the form of night. The nails are the stars. These four are the beginning, the Abhijit, the Vishvajit, the Svarasama, the Visuva, the Mahavratiya, the Udayaniya Atiratra.
2.427.6	This is the form of the day, this is the form of night, the stars are the nails.
2.427.7	This person, Prajapati, attains the year, each one according to his own body.
2.428.1	They are born of mind, of breath, of sight, of hearing, of speech, of the Ṛg, of the Yajus, of the Sāman, of Brahman, of gold, of immortality.
2.428.2	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
2.428.3	The gods approached Prajapati, saying, "We shall conquer the Asuras."
2.428.4	He said, "You do not know me, nor do the Asuras.
2.428.5	"You all know me as that, then you all will be the victors and the Asuras will be defeated."
2.428.6	They said, "Tell us that."
2.428.7	He said, "The Purusha is Prajapati, the year. You should know that.
2.428.8	Then you all will be and the Asuras shall be defeated."
2.428.9	That person, Prajapati, is the year, thus they worship him. From that the gods became superior to the Asuras.
2.428.10	He who, knowing this, worships the person, Prajapatı, as the year, will become superior to his enemies and his adversary will be destroyed.
2.429.1	Now about the deities.
2.429.2	This very world is the Atiratra of the Pravargya.
2.429.3	The bright part is the form of the day, the dark part is the form or the night, and the variegated part is the form, of the stars.
2.429.4	The year itself is the heaven, the world; the first day is Brahma, the Abhijit is the Kshatra, the Pratipa is Agni, the Visvajit is the Visvedevas, the Svarasama is the sun, the Visuva is the Aditi, the Visvajiti is Indra, the day and night are the Goayusi, the worlds are the twelve days, Prajapati is the Mahavrati day, the rising Atiratra is the same world.
2.429.5	This is the form of the day, this is the form of night, the stars are the stars.
2.430.1	Those who are present at the Sattra are different from those who are present at other sacrifices.
2.430.2	They come to the Prāyaniya Atiratra and stay in this world,
2.430.3	and whatever food there is in this world, they obtain it.
2.430.4	Then indeed there is lightning in this world. Now we are in this world. Let there be no distress for us.
2.430.5	Then they go to the day of commencement and stay there. They stay in heaven for a year.
2.430.6	Whatever food there is in heaven for a whole year, they obtain that.
2.430.7	Then they know, "Now we are in heaven." There is no distress for us."
2.430.8	Then they live in the spring season, which is the Brahma season.
2.430.9	Whatever food there is in the Brahma season, they obtain that.
2.430.10	Now indeed, the lightning is the Brahman. Now we are here. There is no distress for us at all."
2.430.11	Then they go to the one which is the Prsthya (day) and stay there. They stay in the Kshatra (day).
2.430.12	Whatever food there is in the Kshatriya (day), they obtain that.
2.430.13	Then indeed, the lightning is the king. Now we are here. There is no distress for us at all."
2.430.14	And those who approach the Abhijit and dwell there, they dwell in Agni.
2.430.15	And in Agni, indeed, is food. They obtain that very food.
2.430.16	Then indeed, the lightning is in the fire. Now we are here. May there be no distress for us.
2.430.17	And those who approach the Svara-saman and dwell in them, they dwell in all the gods.
2.430.18	And whatever food there is in all the gods, that they obtain by that.
2.430.19	Then indeed, the lightning is in all the gods. Now we are in this world. There is no distress for us at all.
2.430.20	Then they who have approached the equinox and dwell there, they dwell in the sun.
2.430.21	Whatever food there is in the sun, they obtain it by that.
2.430.22	Then indeed the lightning is the sun. Now we are here. Let there be no distress among us.
2.430.23	And those who approach the Vishvajit sacrifice and stay there, they stay with Indra.
2.430.24	And whatever food there is in Indra, that they obtain by that.
2.430.25	Then indeed, the lightning is Indra. Now at this time, there is no distress among them.
2.430.26	And those who come and stay with the cattle, they stay for a day and night.
2.430.27	And whatever food there is for a day and a night, that they obtain by it.
2.430.28	Now indeed, the lightning is the day and night. Now indeed, we are here. There is no distress for us at all.
2.430.29	And those who come to the twelve-day period and dwell in the worlds, they dwell in the worlds.
2.430.30	And whatever food there is in the worlds, that they obtain by that.
2.430.31	Then indeed, the lightning is in the worlds. Now we are here. There is no distress to us at all.
2.430.32	Then on the day of the Great Vratas, they stay in Prajapati.
2.430.33	Whatever food there is in Prajapati, they obtain that.
2.430.34	Now indeed, the lightning is Prajapati. Now we are here. Let there be no distress among us."
2.430.35	And when they have approached the Udayaniya Atiratra, they dwell in that world.
2.430.36	And whatever food there is in that world, they obtain it by that.
2.430.37	Then indeed, in this world, there is the lightning. Now, at this time, we are in that world. There is no distress for us at all."
2.431.1	Those who are seated in truth are different from those who are seated in the sacrifice.
2.431.2	Those who are in truth, they indeed are seated in the truth. Those who are in the sacrifice, they indeed are sacrificing.
2.431.3	Those who indeed know this and initiate, they are the ones who are seated in Truth.
2.431.4	For in these deities, those who are seated go to Truth.
2.431.5	They destroy all evil.
2.431.6	And those who, having had their hair cut, wish to go forth and join the sacrifice, they are indeed the participants of the sacrifice.
2.431.7	He who accuses him knowing this, saying, "Just as these deities are to be invited, so do not do," for he accuses him when he has approached these deities, when he is dwelling in them. For him who knows this there is no distress at all.
2.431.8	He who accuses him suffers distress.
2.431.9	These ten days of the year are the two Atiratras, the first and the last, the two Pravargya and Abhijit sacrifices, the two Visvajit and Abhijit sacrifices, the Svarasama and the two Visuva sacrifices.
2.431.10	Pravati, the son of Kauśāntaka, was a student of Kusumbinda, the son of Auddalaka.
2.431.11	He said to him, "O Soma's son, how many days does your father think are in a year?"
2.431.12	He said, "Ten."
2.431.13	He said, "Ten indeed! The Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food, and the sacrifice is Viraj.
2.431.14	How many does he think are there?"
2.431.15	He said "Nine."
2.431.16	He said " Nine indeed!
2.431.17	Nine are the breaths in a man.
2.431.18	The sacrifice is supported by the vital airs.
2.431.19	How many does he not know?
2.431.20	He said, 'Eight.'
2.431.21	He said, ‘Eight indeed.’
2.431.22	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
2.431.23	The sacrifice is Gayatri.
2.431.24	How many indeed does he not know ?
2.431.25	He said, Seven.
2.431.26	He said, “Seven indeed.”
2.431.27	The sacrifice is supported by seven metres.
2.431.28	How many does he not know?
2.431.29	He said, "Six."
2.431.30	He said, "Six indeed."
2.431.31	There are six seasons in a year.
2.431.32	The year is the sacrifice.
2.431.33	How many does he not?know?
2.431.34	He said "Five."
2.431.35	He said, "Five indeed."
2.431.36	The sacrifice is fivefold.
2.431.37	Animals are fivefold.
2.431.38	The sacrifice is animals.
2.431.39	How many does he not know?
2.431.40	He said, four.
2.431.41	He said, there are four.
2.431.42	There are four directions, animals have four feet, there are four metres, the Yajnavahini is the Gāyatrī, the Tristubh, the Jagatī and the Anushtubh.
2.431.43	How many does he not?
2.431.44	He said three.
2.431.45	He said there are three.
2.431.46	The sacrifice is threefold, the three breaths are Prāṇa, Apāna and Vyāna, and these three worlds.
2.431.47	How many does one not cross?
2.431.48	He said two.
2.431.49	He said two indeed.
2.431.50	Day and night indeed.
2.431.51	These two worlds are like a pair of eyes, the two breaths are Prāņa and Apāna, and man has two feet.
2.431.52	How many indeed does one not cross over?
2.431.53	He said one.
2.431.54	He said, "It is one."
2.431.55	"It is the day."
2.431.56	"This is the day, tomorrow it will be."
2.431.57	"This day is called 'day' (ahara)."
2.431.58	"This day indeed is the foundation of the year."
2.431.59	"He who knows this foundation stands firm."
2.431.60	"This alone is his unity."
2.431.61	He who knows this oneness of her, becomes one with her and prospers.
2.431.62	They say, "The past, the present, and the future."
2.431.63	One should say, "The present is the past and the future." The past, the present and the future.
2.431.64	These worlds are past, this fire is past, this wind is past, this sun is past, this Indra is past, this moon is past.
2.431.65	These are the lords of the past and the present.
2.431.66	Therefore, what is true now will be true in the future.
2.432.1	Now this is the Prāyaniya Atiratra of Vaisvānara.
2.432.2	Its upward arrangement is for heaven.
2.432.3	Its Rathantara is the Prstha, the Vamadevya is the Maitrāvaruṇa Sāman, and the Bṛhat is the Pavamāna of the Ārbhava.
2.432.4	The Rathantara is this world, the Vamade vya is the atmosphere, and the Bृhat is yonder world.
2.432.5	This is the upward-going Kīrti, leading to heaven.
2.432.6	By means of this Kīrti they ascend to the heavenly world.
2.432.7	And this indeed is their Kīrti, which carries the entire sacrifice in a complete form.
2.433.1	Its Gayatri is the Hinkara, the Rathantara is the Pratihara, the Vamadevya is the Udgitha, the Brihat is the Pratihari, and the Yajnayajniya is the Nidhana.
2.433.2	Each of these (verses) indeed rules over a part of heaven.
2.433.3	He who knows this attains heaven.
2.433.4	And this indeed is the Arky (verse), this is the Mahāvrata (verse).
2.433.5	Its head is the Gāyatrī, the wings are the Bṛhat and Rathantara, the body is the Vāmadevya, the tail is the Yajñāyajñiya.
2.433.6	He who knows this, obtains as much as one who is endowed with the Gayatri, the Mahāvrata and the Varuna rites.
2.433.7	And this indeed is the arrangement for longevity.
2.433.8	The Gayatri is indeed longevity, the Rathantara is all-long-lived, the Vamadevya is equal longevity, the Brihat is all-long, the Yajñayajñiya is excessive longevity.
2.433.9	Those who praise with this hymn become long-lived.
2.433.10	Now these are the five lights of them, which shine in these worlds: Agni on earth, Vayu in the sky, Aditya in heaven, the moon among the stars, and lightning in the water.
2.433.11	Agni is the Rathantara, Vayu the Vamadevya, Aditya the Brihat, the moon the Gayatra, and lightning the Yagyayajniya.
2.433.12	The waters are the Yajñāyajñiya.
2.433.13	These five lights shine in these worlds.
2.434.1	Of this Agniṣṭoma with Stomas, there are two hundred and fifty Stotriya verses.
2.434.2	Then at night, with Rathantara, there are one hundred and ninety-nine Stotriya verses.
2.434.3	Those three are the excess of the male, by which he generates. Two are the deficiency of the female, from which she generates.
2.434.4	The male's form is the day for the female, the night.
2.434.5	That is the excess of the man, he places it in the deficiency of the woman in the other world, for the sake of union and generation.
2.434.6	One is born through union, who knows this.
2.434.7	Now those two Stotriya verses which are in excess are indeed the two eggs which are in excess.
2.434.8	They are yoked to the Brihat and Rathantara and carry the sacrifice.
2.434.9	Where they would perform the Sodashin, there would be a swelling or a tumour.
2.434.10	For if a fourth man were to be born among these three men who are in excess, they would say, "There would be a swelling for him or a tumour."
2.434.11	In the same way, if a woman conceives.
2.434.12	If someone were to say to one who is performing the Sodashin, "This will cause a boil or a tumor," it would be so.
2.434.13	Therefore, the Sodashin should not be performed here.
2.435.1	This is the Atiratra sacrifice, except for the Sodashin. It consists of twenty-one Ekavinshas and one Stotriya.
2.435.2	Then, the one who is the twenty-first, that is indeed the Sun.
2.435.3	The lordship and sovereignty of this world of the Sun.
2.435.4	One who knows this attains the lordship and sovereignty of the world beyond.
2.435.5	If they were to perform the sixteen-fold sacrifice here, then twenty-two and twenty-one would be accomplished, and one would be the praiseworthy.
2.435.6	One should desire prosperity.
2.435.7	He indeed becomes one with the one hundred and fifty-three-fold (Stoma) and one Stotriya.
2.435.8	From that, he who is one hundred and fifty three-fold, he is indeed Agni.
2.435.9	The lordship and sovereignty of this world belongs to Agni.
2.435.10	He who knows this goes to the lordship and sovereignty of the world.
2.435.11	If they were to perform the Sodashin here, then there would be fifty-one and four Stotriya verses.
2.435.12	They would be aiming for prosperity.
2.435.13	They would not attain any other prosperity.
2.435.14	This is the divine path, namely, the Atiratra of Pravargya and Vaishvanara.
2.435.15	In that, this Sodashin is performed, which is the standing (Sthana) (rite).
2.435.16	Viraj is the sixteenfold, Viraj is established in Viraj.
2.435.17	Wherever one may think of this Viraj as being accomplished, there one should chant with this.
2.436.1	And this is the twenty-fourth day of commencement.
2.436.2	Its upward arrangement is for heaven.
2.436.3	His Rathantara is at midday, then the Daigha-shravas, then the Naushadasa.
2.436.4	This is the Rathantara.
2.436.5	The Daigha-sravas is the atmosphere.
2.436.6	This is indeed the Vama-deviya, by means of the Nidhana.
2.436.7	The Naushadasa is indeed the present.
2.436.8	This is its body of the Brihat.
2.436.9	This is that upward arrangement leading to heaven.
2.436.10-14	By means of this (rite) they ascend to the heavenly world. For this day some make the Rathantara as the Prastara, as the Rathantara is the Prastara of the Atiratra. The heavenly world is far away. We ascend to this heavenly world which is far away. The Rathantara would be the midday (verse) if it were a descent.
2.436.15	But those who say that it is not so well-established,
2.436.16	that is indeed as if it were something else, as if it were not conducive to longevity.
2.436.17	He who would pronounce them thus, saying "it will be so" or "it will be thus", they would indeed be so.
2.436.18	Therefore the Brihat should be the Prastara, the Rathantara the Madhyandina.
2.436.19	This is its form.
2.436.20	This is the proper arrangement for heaven.
2.437.1	His Brihat is the Prastara, the Vamadevya is the Maitravaruna's Sama, the Shyaita is the Brahman's Sama.
2.437.2	The sky is indeed the Brihat, the Vamade vya, this is the Shyaita.
2.437.3	This is the body of the Rathantara.
2.437.4	This is its proper arrangement for heaven.
2.437.5	By means of this arrangement, they ascend to heaven in the right way.
2.437.6	The prāṇāpānavyānas are in the right way,
2.437.7	they move to and fro without being exhausted.
2.437.8	Those who praise with it become long-lived.
2.437.9	His stotras have two kinds, twenty-four and thirty-six.
2.437.10	Then those which are twenty-four. The year consists of twenty-four half-months. They attain the year by half-months.
2.437.11	Then those which are thirty-six. The Brihatī consists of thirty-six syllables.
2.437.12	The Brihatī is heaven, the world, and sovereignty. They go to heaven, to the world, and to sovereignty, standing on the Brihatī.
2.437.13	And indeed, by this very thirty-six-fold Stoma, the year is begun in the form of the seasons.
2.437.14	There are twelve full moons, twelve eights, and twelve new moons in the year.
2.437.15	They begin the year with this thirty-sixfold Stoma, in stages.
2.438.1	These are the two verses about it:
2.438.2	The odd ones carry in front, the even ones follow.
2.438.3	They go around the year with the metres, one by one, for twelve months.
2.438.4	On the last day of the twelfth month, they arranged thirty-six (bricks), leaving one out.
2.438.5	Then those who were yoked with the even ones went to the east, and those who were yokled with the odd ones went to the west.
2.438.6	Thus it is said.
2.438.7	It has twelve Stotras.
2.438.8	That makes it an Agniṣṭoma.
2.438.9	There are twelve of them, and there are also fifteen, twenty-four Stotras.
2.439.3	Then light was born.
2.439.4	This world is indeed life, that world is cattle, this world is indeed the sky, light is the sun.
2.439.5	They made it in front of them, as if it were a son.
2.439.6	This world above is the upper one, that world below is the lower one.
2.439.7	That light is raised up in front of them.
2.439.8	By that we see.
2.439.9	They both went to the Yoga, they brought the light to the end.
2.439.10	It was like a father and mother following a son who had gone before them.
2.439.11	These are the Stotras that are in pairs, because they are yoked.
2.439.12	The son lies between the husband and wife.
2.439.13	Just as those two, when they are to be united, would take a son from here or there, so is this.
2.439.14	These are the deficient and excessive pairs of Stotras.
2.440.1	Now, indeed, the Asuras named Panaya were the protectors of the cattle of the gods.
2.440.2	They were driven away by them.
2.440.3	They were obstructed in Rasa and were pressed down by force.
2.440.4	The gods said to Aliklva, "O Suparna, please search for our cows."
2.440.5	"So be it."
2.440.6	He descended.
2.440.7	They had gone to Rasa, and were hidden by the power of the Vala.
2.440.8	To him who had come, they placed ghee, milk, curds, and buttermilk.
2.440.9	He ate them and became well-nourished.
2.440.10	They said to him, "This very Suparna will be your offering. Do not tell us about this food."
2.440.11	He again fell down.
2.440.12	They said to him, "Suparna knows cows."
2.440.13	He said, "What is the fame of cows?"
2.440.14	This is the fame of cows. Thus Indra, pressing his neck, said to him. "Your mouth is indeed in the cows."
2.440.15	He indeed pressed the curd-drop, the Vāmaikṣā.
2.440.16	He became this one who is born in spring on the earth, the Vasantas.
2.440.17	He cursed him, saying, "Let thy life be a mean one, thou who, having found our cows, did not tell us." And that is the meanest part of this village.
2.441.1	They said to Saramā, "Saramā, do thou find these cows for us."
2.441.2	"So be it," she said, and went in pursuit.
2.441.3	She came to Rasa.
2.441.4	This is indeed that Rasa, which flows from the ocean towards the east.
2.441.5	He said to her, "I shall float you or you will be my depth."
2.441.6	She said to him, "Float me, I will not be your depth."
2.441.7	She then floated with her ears, and went away.
2.441.8	She thought, "How can this bitch float? I shall make her sink."
2.441.9	He said to her, "Do not be afraid. I will be your support."
2.441.10	She said, "Yes."
2.441.11	And she had support.
2.441.12	She went beyond the support.
2.441.13	They came to her at Rasāyana, and were enclosed within the strength.
2.441.14	When she came to them, they placed before her the same ghee, milk, curds, and buttermilk.
2.441.15	She said, "I do not know of any other cattle of the gods which I could eat except you."
2.441.16	"We have committed a theft of the gods. We are following the tracks of these cows."
2.441.17	"Do not let us be punished. Do not take away Indra's cows."
2.441.18	She stayed there without drying up.
2.441.19	She knew that the embryo had been expelled.
2.441.20	She ate it.
2.442.2	They said, "Do as you think fit."
2.442.3	Indra said to her, "I will make your progeny the first to eat food, which has followed our cows."
2.442.4	These are the Vidarbha Maachalas, the Sarameyas.
2.442.5	They even kill tigers.
2.442.6	The gods brought together this raft.
2.442.7	By it they crossed over.
2.442.8	Whatever they plunged into, that became the plunging of the Abhiplva.
2.442.9	They obtained strength by Agni and struck with the thunderbolt.
2.442.10	That which is the light in front is Agni, and that which is the fifteen-fold Bahispavamāna is the thunderbolt.
2.442.11	They became strong by means of life.
2.442.12	Whatever they became strong by means, that became the life of life.
2.442.13	They surrounded the light from both sides with this (Sāman).
2.442.14	These four are the Uthyas in the middle.
2.442.15	The Uthyas are indeed cattle.
2.442.16	Among them, a thousand are Stotriyas.
2.442.17	Brahma is indeed the light, the Agnishtoma.
2.442.18	They surrounded the light from all sides with this Brahma.
2.442.19	Those who, knowing this, perform the Abhipava sacrifice, rise up with a thousand (cows).
2.442.20	They say, "This is the four-day sacrifice in the middle, connected with the cow, life, cow, life. But why are the two Jyotiṣa sacrifices inverted?"
2.442.21	One should say, "For the sake of union and procreation."
2.442.22	He who knows this is born through union.
3.1.1	Prajapati indeed was the first to be here.
3.1.2	He desired, "May I be many, may I beget, may I reach the earth."
3.1.3	He performed austerities.
3.1.4	He saw the seasonal (rite) in himself.
3.1.5	From that he created the three seasons, these very worlds.
3.1.6	That he created from the seasonal (rite), that is the reason why the seasons are called seasons.
3.1.7	Because he generated the Rtuvijas, they are called Rtuvijas.
3.1.8	When he first heated himself, he created summer from that.
3.1.9	Therefore, he heats himself most intensely.
3.1.10	When he heated himself first, he created summer.
3.1.11	Therefore, it is the most intense heat.
3.1.12	When he next heated himself, he produced the rainy season from that.
3.1.13	Therefore they do both, they heat and they rain.
3.1.14	From what he heated third, he created the winter.
3.1.15	Therefore it is the coldest of all.
3.1.16	He heated three.
3.1.17	He divided them into two.
3.1.18	They became the six seasons.
3.1.19	He made the spring from the summer, the autumn from the rainy season, the winter from the autumn.
3.1.20	Therefore these seasons are as if created by union.
3.1.21	He heated himself with six fires.
3.1.22	He divided them into two.
3.1.23	They became twelve months.
3.1.24	He heated with twelve fires.
3.1.25	He separated them into two.
3.1.26	They became twenty-four half-months.
3.1.27	He heated them for twenty-four months.
3.1.28	He thought, "If I were to divide them into two, they would not be sufficient. Let me create them."
3.1.29	From them he created seven hundred and twenty days and nights.
3.1.30	He created all this.
3.1.31	Just as gold, when not fashioned, is the same, so is this before that.
3.1.32	All the arts are practised in him, both fashioned and unfashioned, by one who knows this.
3.2.1	He alone is this Prajapati, who became the year.
3.2.2	Having established and pervaded all this, he stood.
3.2.3	He thought, "By what means of sustenance, by what food, by what means of nourishment, shall I be able to overcome this?"
3.2.4	In him he saw this means of sustenance, nourishment, and food, which is not to be found on earth: twelve full moons, twelve eights, twelve new moons.
3.2.5	He tried to ascend it.
3.2.6	He said to him, "Do not ascend it when you are tired."
3.2.7	He practiced austerity.
3.2.8	He saw this twelve-day sacrifice.
3.2.9	They brought it.
3.2.10	He desired, "May the initiated not sacrifice to the initiated."
3.2.11	He said to the months and fortnights, "Sacrifice for me."
3.2.12	The months did not say.
3.2.13	He said, "You will enjoy the truth in us alone."
3.2.14	Therefore, all these are in the month of Māgha - the full-moon days, the eight days, and the new-moon day.
3.2.15	The seasons, having given birth to the cattle, later understood (the truth). They said, "He has given to us."
3.2.16	They said to him, "Give us also a dakṣiṇā."
3.2.17	He gave them food.
3.2.18	This is the food that is cooked according to the seasons.
3.2.19	He obtained the full-moon sacrifices by means of the consecratory rites, the Aṣṭakās by means of the Upaṣads, and the New-moon sacrifices by the Prāsuta.
3.2.20	He who, knowing this, performs the twelve-day sacrifice, obtains this very world of prosperity, nourishment, food, and immortality.
3.2.21	The seasons took up (the sacrifices), not the months; the months did not desire to take up (the sacrifices).
3.2.22	Therefore the months are more well-known.
3.2.23	For one who does not accept becomes more well-known,
3.2.24	Therefore the seasons are greater.
3.2.25	For one accepting becomes greater,
3.2.26	These three nights are indeed the full moon, the eight days of the new moon, and the new moon.
3.3.1	The gods stood before Indra for supremacy.
3.3.2	He approached Prajapati, saying, "Grant me the seasons."
3.3.3	He gave him these two, the Full Moon and the New Moon.
3.3.4	He placed the eight days in this (month).
3.3.5	Then the gods stood for supremacy to Indra.
3.3.6	He who knows this stands for supremacy to himself.
3.3.7	Therefore on this night all live together in peace.
3.3.8	For indeed, these (cows) dwell in Prajapati, the father.
3.3.9	Therefore, one should not offer oblations on this night. If one were to offer oblations, one should not say anything.
3.3.10	Prajapati is indeed unutterable.
3.3.11	Whatever he does three times there, whatever is well-settled and dwells in his house, that is indeed his prosperity.
3.3.12	Those months and seasons said, "By which sacrifice our father Prajapati having worshipped, obtained offspring, by that we shall perform."
3.3.13	They brought him that (sacrifice).
3.3.14	Prajapati thought, "If they complete this, then they will be like me."
3.3.15-19	He said to them, "Let us be initiated by me, the householder." They said to him, "We will tell you." He said, "I will tell you." Therefore, they call the four months by the name of the year, and the seasons and months by the name. Therefore, a son calls his father, and a father calls his sons.
3.3.20	Those who know this are able to see the householders.
3.4.1	They performed sacrifices. Those months and fortnights were established in the year, the year in the seasons and months.
3.4.2	Therefore they say, "The prosperity of the one who performs the sacrifice and the one who makes others perform the sacrifice is equal."
3.4.3	One should think, "The prosperity is equal to mine by performing this."
3.4.4	Just as he is, so am I.
3.4.5	One should perform the sacrifice with this alone.
3.4.6	For indeed, Prajapati alone succeeded.
3.4.7	If many were to perform the sacrifice, they should perform it in groups of twelve or thirteen, thus: these four, these four, these three, and this one.
3.4.8	If they desire that the sacrifice should be deficient, then it is indeed the sacrifice that becomes deficient.
3.4.9	If many were to offer, they should offer sixteen or seventeen. These are four and these are four.
3.4.10	If many were to sacrifice, twenty-four or twenty-five were to sacrifice, these five, these five, five, five, these four, this one, they would be created, whoever they may desire, the decline of the sacrifice would follow him, indeed, the decline of sacrifice follows him alone.
3.4.11	All others prosper.
3.4.12	He who knows the householder and the housewife of the sacrifice, attains the Garhapatya, attains the Garhapata.
3.4.13	The householder is indeed the year, and the housewife is this (earth).
3.4.14	He who knows this, attains the Garhpatya, attains Garhapata.
3.5.1	He who knows the sovereignty of the metres goes to sovereignty, he attains the world of sovereignty.
3.5.2	The Brihatī is the sovereign of the metres.
3.5.3	They live on this metre, facing west, facing east, facing downwards.
3.5.4	Therefore they live on the animal facing west, facing north, facing downwards.
3.5.5	This much indeed is the year, the power and strength of Indra, namely, the twelve-day (rite), the twelve full-moons, the twelve eights, the twelve new-moons. He attains that (power and strength) by this (rite).
3.5.6	He who knows Viraj established in the seasons, and the seasons established in Viraj, goes to the established, attains stability and food.
3.5.7	Viraj has thirty syllables.
3.5.8	There are six seasons.
3.5.9	This indeed is Viraj established in the seasons, the seasons in Viraj.
3.5.10	He who knows this goes to the firm foundation and obtains food.
3.5.11	The twelve-day sacrifice indeed rests on the Anushtubh.
3.5.12	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
3.5.13	Animals have four feet.
3.5.14	Speech is Anushtubh
3.5.15	He supports animals with speech.
3.5.16	Therefore, the animals are accomplished by speech, and they come when called by speech.
3.6.1	The first three days have the Gayatri as their face.
3.6.2	Therefore this Agni shines upward.
3.6.3	The second three days have the Gāyatrī as their middle.
3.6.4	Therefore this wind blows horizontally.
3.6.5	The third three days have the Gaayatri as their end.
3.6.6	Therefore, that Aditya shines below.
3.6.7	By means of brilliance, the Gayatri first supported the three days by feet, the second by syllables, and the third by letters.
3.6.8	The Gayatri is threefold, the brilliance is threefold.
3.6.9	The first day is threefold.
3.6.10	By that, the first three days were supported.
3.6.11	The Gayatrl has three feet, the three days in the middle. By that, the second three days were supported.
3.6.12	The Gayatri has twenty-four syllables, the seventh day is twenty-four, and by that very (day) the third Triyha is held.
3.6.13	How is the Gayatri twelve days? They say:
3.6.14	Just as a wheel goes around everywhere, so the Gayatri goes around everywhere for twelve days, for non-slipping.
3.6.15	Just as the spokes are held in a chariot, so the twelve-day (rite) is held in the Gāyatrī for non-drowning.
3.6.16	This is indeed the ray or the support, namely the Gāyatrī.
3.6.17	The twelve-day (ritual) is held in it for non-confusion.
3.6.18	The Anushtubh indeed expands, namely the twelve-day.
3.6.19	The first day is begun with eight syllables, the second with eleven, and the third with twelve.
3.6.20	Only three syllables are left over.
3.6.21	He then continues with the next three days.
3.7.1	The fourth day is carried by the metres.
3.7.2	They eat the food of that which is in the west, in the east, and in the north.
3.7.3	Therefore they live on cattle which are in the west, east, and north.
3.7.4	When Prajapati was born, he was born with sin.
3.7.5	He desired, 'May I destroy sin.'
3.7.6	He saw this sacrifice of twelve days, with the Vyuha metre.
3.7.7	He performed it.
3.7.8	He performed a sacrifice.
3.7.9	He removed the evil of the universe.
3.7.10	One who feels as if he is afflicted by evil should perform this sacrifice of twelve days with the Vyuḍha-chant.
3.7.11	He indeed removes the evil of the entire universe.
3.7.12	The offspring become as if moving in a circle.
3.7.13	Now, the reason why the northern oblations are in the Gāyatrī metre is that they may not be injured.
3.7.14	The Gāyatrī is indeed a ray, a support.
3.7.15	In it the twelve-day sacrifice is supported, so that it may not be injured
3.8.1	Prajapati created the creatures by means of the ten-day sacrifice.
3.8.2	Those created by him became scattered and were lost.
3.8.3	He saw these two Vaisvânara (sacrifices) as the Atiratras.
3.8.4	He surrounded them on both sides, saying, 'This one above, and that one below.'
3.8.5	He thus excluded them by means of these (sacrifices).
3.8.6	In that he excluded all beings, therefore the Vaisvânaras are called Vaisvânarâs.
3.8.7	The Udgâtri is Prajapati.
3.8.8	He creates beings by means of the ten days.
3.8.9	He thus wards off these two by means of the two Vaisvânara (offerings), by the one above and by the other below, for the sake of the preservation of offspring.
3.8.10	He whose knowledge is thus, his wealth is not taken away by others.
3.8.11	The Prâna is the former Vaisvânarâ, the Apâna the latter.
3.8.12	By means of the Prâna and Apâna they attain the prosperity of the world.
3.8.13	Therefore, one should sleep with the Stotra, lest the vital airs be injured.
3.8.14	They say, who is the lord of sleep?
3.8.15	What the vital airs do while awake, that is the waking state.
3.8.16	One should sleep only when one wishes.
3.8.17	They say, "This is the highest sacrifice, the Atiratra. Why do they perform this highest sacrifice first?"
3.8.18	One should say, "It is because of the attainment of all sacrifices."
3.8.19	These are all the sacrifices, namely, the Agniṣṭoma, Uktha and Atiratra.
3.8.20	He who knows that the Agniṣṭoma is performed for ten days, attains the same.
3.8.21	It is performed for him. The first three days are performed by the morning pressing, the second three by the midday pressing, the third three by the third pressing, and the tenth day by the Agniṣṭomapāvamāna.
3.8.22	It is indeed performed for him who knows this.
3.9.1	The Prāṇa is the first Vaiśvānara, the Apāna is the last. The days between are the remaining days.
3.9.2	This is the Gāyatrī, the twelve-day Jyotiṣpāksa.
3.9.3	The two Atirātras are the two wings, the two Agniṣṭomas are the two eyes, the two Atirātra are the two outer eyes, the two Agnișṭomas are the inner eyes.
3.9.4	Therefore the pupils are between the eyes.
3.9.5	Now those eight days are the Gāyatrī.
3.9.6	By that the gods went to the heavenly world.
3.9.7	He who knows this goes to the heavenly world
3.9.8	They say there is a Jāmi in the twelve-day (rite).
3.9.9	One should not say that there is no Jāmi in those eight days which are in the middle with Ukthas.
3.9.10	The Ukthas are indeed cattle.
3.9.11	He thus makes the animals equal to the animals.
3.9.12	Animals are more beautiful when made equal to animals.
3.9.13	The Jyotistoma Atiratra leads to the attainment of Viraj.
3.9.14	Viraj is the year, the procreator.
3.9.15	Two Stotriya verses are sung in excess of the previous day, and two in excess of the subsequent day.
3.9.16	Those who are on either side of the Viraj of the morning, the Brihat and the Rathantara, they carry the sacrifice yoked together. And those who are on either sides of the Viraj in the afternoon, that is the milking and the establishment.
3.9.17	One desiring heaven should offer the Ayusstoma.
3.9.18	The Stomas go upwards for non-deterioration.
3.10.1	One desiring strength should offer the Gosstoma.
3.10.2	The fifteenfold is strength, for strength is power.
3.10.3	As long as they live, they are vigorous.
3.10.4	But those who are masters are prone to die.
3.10.5	They go from the vital airs.
3.10.6	Those who sacrifice with the Trivrt (Stoma) have a fixed (Stoma), those who do not sacrifice have an undefined (Stoma).
3.10.7	If the Brihat is the back (Stoma), they praise with the Rathantara and the Asvins.
3.10.8	This is the Rathantara, the Brihat.
3.10.9	They step on this one without stepping on that one.
3.10.10	They become short-lived or long-lived.
3.10.11	Or just as one would dig a well beyond it, it is dug beyond it and does not drink.
3.10.12	If the Rathantara is the background, then they praise with the Rathantara and the Ashvins.
3.11.1	They say that it is the milk-offering.
3.11.2	One should not say that there is no milk-offering there.
3.11.3	Speech is the Rathantara, speech is the Asvina. From where will it be offered?
3.11.4	This indeed is the one-verse milk-offering, namely speech, whether one is offering or not.
3.11.5	They say, "Do thou flow, O most excellent of speech; let men sing to thee." The verses are in the form of questions and answers.
3.11.6	In Pavamāna they recite the Rathantara.
3.11.7	The Brihat is the Pratihara.
3.11.8	They praise with the Jarabodhiyas and the Asvins.
3.11.9	This is the hymn of Rudra, the god.
3.11.10	By this, indeed, the god Rudra attained lordship over the cattle. By that by which the god Rudra obtained lordship over the cattle, we may obtain lordship over the cattle."
3.11.11	They say, "The lord is cruel and restless, and he is intent on the cattle of the sacrificer who is intent on him.
3.11.12	They say that the entire speech is Brahman, namely, the Ashvina.
3.11.13	By means of this entire speech, they are pacified by Brahman and Ashvina.
3.11.14	They recite the verses of the Apisharvaras in the Urdhvasadman.
3.11.15	The gods, having driven away the Asuras from these worlds by means of the Urdhva-sadman, performed the Sattra in their own abode.
3.11.16	Having driven away the hated enemy from these worlds by means of the upper abode, he dwells in his own abode at the Sattra. He who knows thus,
3.12.1	Brahma is the Agniṣṭoma.
3.12.2	The Pravargya day is Brahma.
3.12.3	This is indeed the measure of the sacrifice, namely the Agniṣṭomah.
3.12.4	The sacrifice is of such a measure, by that measure they enter the Sattra. The touch of the Pravaṇas is of such a kind, the touch of the Upapraṇas is of the same kind.
3.12.5	Therefore they conclude with the Agniṣṭoma and begin with the Agniṣtoma.
3.12.6	Mind is indeed the former, then speech.
3.12.7	Mind is the Brhat, speech the Rathantara.
3.12.8	The ancient is the Brhat; the Rathantara is the new.
3.12.9	Now, as to why they are the Prāṇavati and the Upavati, it is indeed for the purpose of yoking the Brihat and the Rathantara at the Sattra.
3.12.10	The Gāyatrī metre indeed goes and comes.
3.12.11	Now, when it is said, 'Preti' and 'Ceti', they indeed come to an end with the form of the Gāyatrī. They do not become (the same as) that. The Rk and the Ahara are yoked together in a manner that is not suitable. It is like placing a yoke-pin in a yoked pair.
3.12.12	They say, 'Those who cut off the verses of the Pravargya day are indeed deprived of life.'
3.12.13-15	They become with the Lakṣmaṇa-verses. The Lakṣmaṇa verses are the vital airs. For the uninterrupted continuity of the vital airs. "O Agni, come for worship; O Mitra-Varuna, come to us; O Indra-Agni, come to the Soma that has been pressed." The verses beginning with "O Agni, come" and ending with "O Mitra-Varuna" are the verses of invocation. "O Mitra-Varuni, come; O Indra-Varuni, O Indra-Agne, come." The verses beginning "O Mitra-Vāruni, come" and "O Indra-Agni" are the verses for invocation. "Come, come" - the yoked ones proceed in front.
3.12.16	As the Yajus-reciters go forward, saying, "Come, come," so they go.
3.12.17	The Stoma is threefold.
3.12.18	Brahman is threefold.
3.12.19	They go forward, standing firm in Brahman.
3.13.1	"The Soma-drinkers, the wise, have gone forward, O Soma, for the worship of the gods. Come, flow forth, and sit down within the enclosure." The verses are progressive on the Rathantara day.
3.13.2	This is the day of the Prāṇīṣa Sāman.
3.13.3	The word 'pra' is the form of the Gāyatrī.
3.13.4	They go by the form of the Gayatri.
3.13.5	If the Pañca-sāma is reversed, it is incomplete.
3.13.6	The breath, the out-breath, and the through-breath are the three verses.
3.13.7	They cut it off.
3.13.8	They cut off themselves, their offspring, their wives, and these worlds.
3.13.9	There are three Sama-s.
3.13.10	That is the Trivrt (stoma) and Trisama (stoma).
3.13.11	Then the horse-sacrifice, the Ratha-ntara (stoma) with the last foot not being obstructed.
3.13.12	From that the Ratha-tara day is performed.
3.13.13	The Pavamana Soma is performed with the Ida-van (stoma).
3.13.14	Indeed, one who is worthy of going to the year should go with the Panca-sama (stoma).
3.13.15	Now, the Yaudhajayana is performed with six verses, because there are six seasons in a year, for the sake of union.
3.13.16	"The verse "The tawny ones have approached the barley-grains" contains the form of Rathantara."
3.13.17	This is the Rathantara day.
3.13.18	"The verses "Pressed for Indra, Vayu, Varuna, and the Maruts" contain the Marutvatis."
3.13.19	The form of midday is like that of the Maruts.
3.13.20	They do not go beyond the form of midday.
3.13.21	The Gayatri verse in them is as explained in the Brahmanas.
3.14.1	Now about the horse.
3.14.2	Prajapati created beings.
3.14.3	He created them by becoming a horse.
3.14.4	The fact that he created them by becoming the horse is the horsehood of the horse.
3.14.5	That is the generative Sama.
3.14.6	It is performed on the day of procreation.
3.14.7	One who knows this is born with offspring and cattle.
3.14.8	Therefore, this is the Sāman from that day, it is not interrupted.
3.14.9	This Sāman is indeed procreation.
3.14.10	This day is procreation.
3.14.11	Herein, procreation is indeed performed.
3.14.12	They indeed call it the Sāman of the horse in the ocean.
3.14.13	The horse of the sea desired, 'May I obtain cattle and go to the cattle-land.'
3.14.14	He saw this Sama.
3.14.15	He praised with it.
3.14.16	Then he obtained cattle and went to the cattle-lands.
3.14.17	This is the cattle-grabbing Sama.
3.14.18	He who knows this obtains cattle and goes to the cattle-worlds.
3.14.19	Because the horse saw it, therefore it is called "horse".
3.14.20	And they say: "The gods, having become horses, went to heaven by means of the horse."
3.14.21	That is indeed the horsehood of the horse.
3.14.22	That is indeed his heavenly (nature).
3.14.23	He who knows this attains heaven.
3.15.1	Now the Soma-sāman.
3.15.2	Soma, the king, was like the one who enjoys the feast, among other deities.
3.15.3	He desired, 'May I be consecrated for kingship over all the gods.'
3.15.4	He saw this Sama.
3.15.5	He praised with it.
3.15.6	Then he was consecrated for kingship of all the gods.
3.15.7	One who knows this is consecrated for kingship among his own people.
3.15.8	He became hidden from them.
3.15.9	They sought him.
3.15.10	They saw him in that form, which is the moon.
3.15.11	They approached him, saying, "We see you, O unseen one."
3.15.12	Therefore, when he shows himself, they approach him, saying, "We see you, unseen one."
3.15.13	They consecrated him.
3.15.14	He became this.
3.15.15	This is the prosperity of the Savasam.
3.15.16	He who knows this attains prosperity and goes to the kingdom.
3.15.17	Because Soma, the king, saw this, it is called the Soma-sāman.
3.15.18	Now the thunderbolt.
3.15.19	Vajra Āṅgirasa, desiring cattle, practiced austerity.
3.15.20	He saw this Sāman and praised with it.
3.15.21	He approached this Iḍā.
3.15.22	Cattle are Iḍā.
3.15.23	Then he obtained the cattle.
3.15.24	This is the Paśvy (cattle-obtaining) Sāman.
3.15.25	He who knows this obtains cattle and becomes one with many cattle.
3.15.26	Because Vajrāṅgirasa saw it, therefore it is called Vajra.
3.15.27	Then the Yaudhajayana (Sāman) for the three Savanas to be performed.
3.15.28	Then the Uṣanasa (hymn) with the last Sāman, we attain the last heaven.
3.15.29	Then the Rathantara.
3.15.30	The Rathantara is Brahman.
3.15.31	They proceed in Brahman.
3.15.32	Then the Vamadevya.
3.15.33	The Vamadevya is cattle.
3.15.34	They become possessed of cattle by praising with it.
3.16.6	Madhu is indeed Soma.
3.16.7	The third pressing is like a learned man.
3.16.8	In that these (verses) are full of Madhu, they indeed put Soma in it.
3.16.9	By this they indeed nourish him.
3.16.10	In them the Gayatri (verse) is as described in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.16.11	Then the Samhita, having two syllables and two feet, for support.
3.16.12	The sacrificer has two feet for support.
3.16.13	Flowing, O god, for the gods, the tawny one flows for the tawny ones. Thus the Uṣṇīṣa and Kakubha verses are formed.
3.16.14	They are in the form of Gāyatrī and Rāthantara verses. The Rāthantara verse is in the eastern direction for victory.
3.16.15	Then the Rāthantara metre, ending with a syllable, without repetition.
3.16.16	Therefore, the Rāthantara rite is performed on that day.
3.16.17	Prajapati created this sacrifice, namely the twelve-day sacrifice.
3.16.18	The other days were not suitable for him with three verses, but this one was suitable with one verse.
3.16.19	It became suitable for him.
3.16.20	He saw these two Sāmans.
3.16.21	With these two he made this day as if cutting leather with two needles.
3.16.22	With the Ashvin in front and the Akashara afterwards.
3.16.23	Now, the reason why these two Sāman-chants are used is for the stability of the day.
3.16.24	The Rathantara day has the Anushtubh verses beginning with 'Pra sunvanāyāndhas'.
3.16.25	This day is indeed the one to be reached.
3.16.26	'Pra' is the form of the Gāyatrī.
3.16.27	They reach by the form of the Gayatri.
3.17.1	Among them is the Gaurīvit.
3.17.2	Just as one who sees the end of a thing finds the end, so these two (verses) of the cow-pen find the morning-food for the gods.
3.17.3	"They sit for the sacrifice, saying, "May we have the morning-food!"
3.17.4	They indeed have the morning-meal.
3.17.5	For this is the morning-meal of the gods, namely, the cow-pen.
3.17.6	He who knows this has the morning-meal.
3.17.7	The one who sees the end of the sacrifice is one, the one who makes the sacrifice is another.
3.17.8	It is like the water and grass that are seen clearly.
3.17.9	Just as the Soma-reciter recites the Soma, in the same way these two recite the Soma to the gods.
3.17.10	The Soma-sacrifice is performed on the day on which the Gaurīvīta is performed.
3.17.11	The gods look at him and say, "Run, tomorrow you will sacrifice."
3.17.12	If they do not perform the Gaurīvita on the same day, they think, "We should not disappoint the gods."
3.17.13	Just as the steps of a tree are made, so are the steps of the cow-pen made for the attainment of heaven.
3.17.14	He who knows this attains heaven.
3.17.15	Just as one would go to a place of rest, so is this cow-pen.
3.17.16	It is indeed sung thus.
3.18.1	The Shaktyas, Tarasapuras, and Purordashas performed a sacrifice.
3.18.2	He, the Shakyan Gauriviti, killed a deer.
3.18.3	Then Tarkshya, the golden-hued bird, swooped down from above.
3.18.4	He then placed it on the ground.
3.18.5	He said to the sage, "Do not touch my bones."
3.18.6	I will tell you tomorrow.
3.18.7	You know it today, not tomorrow."
3.18.8	He said this to Gauriviti.
3.18.9	Then he saw the cow's udder.
3.18.10	The cow's ud-der is the progeny, the cow's udders are the cattle, the cow' s udders are the heavenly world.
3.18.11	That it is tied like a cow is for the attainment of all this, for the obtaining of this.
3.18.12	The essence of speech had flowed out.
3.18.13	That (Soma) became like a cow. In that it becomes like a cow every day, they go on giving the essence of speech every day.
3.18.14	If those who have let loose the cow-like Soma were to be deprived of their cattle, one should say to them: "You will become barren cows."
3.18.15	They indeed become barren cows.
3.19.1	Then the Madhyandina Sāman with the Madhyandina Stoma is chanted. It is for stability.
3.19.2	Those who perform the Pavamāna of the Ārbhava hymn cross the ocean.
3.19.3	That it has a middle-ending is for stability.
3.19.4	They perform the Pratihara before that ending.
3.19.5	The sacrificer is held by the Prāstāra and Pratihara.
3.19.6	This day is like a rushing river, since it is three-fold.
3.19.7	Now, the reason why they perform the Pratihara rite before the Nidhana is for non-slipping.
3.19.8	Indra, having struck Vritra with the thunderbolt, entered the cows, thinking, "I will not thirst."
3.19.9	They desired, "Let us generate Indra."
3.19.10	They saw these common Sama hymns, the Tvashtr-saman hymns.
3.19.11	With them they generated Indra.
3.19.12	These are the Sama hymns that generate heroes.
3.19.13	The hero is born in the mouth of him who knows this.
3.19.14	Now, indeed, the animals are connected with Tvashtri.
3.19.15	And because these are the Sāmans, it is for the purpose of securing animals.
3.19.16	And because it is connected with Ida, animals are Ida; it is for the sake of securing animals. 
3.19.17	Because they saw the animals, therefore it is called the Tvashtri-Sāman.
3.19.18	"He flows forth the dear (waters) for the good of the dear ones." The word 'abhi' is a form of Rathantara.
3.19.19	This is the Rathantara day.
3.19.20	The Brāhmaṇa on these (days) has been spoken.
3.19.21	Now the Brāhmaṇa of the Yajñāyajñiya (Sāman).
3.20.1	"Flow forth, O Soma, the best of waters," the verses are repetitions.
3.20.2	The Brihat and the Rathantara were created, the Brihat was created first, then the Rathantara.
3.20.3	Therefore flow forth, O Soma, as the foremost of songs. The verses are in the same order.
3.20.4	The other sages saw it going away, the others saw it coming back.
3.20.5	Then this is neither going nor coming.
3.20.6	Bharadvaja, the sage, saw the form of speech in the Brihat.
3.20.7-13	This is the Vedic hymn of Bharadvaja, namely, the Brihat. The mind is Brihat. Prajapati is Brihat. He who knows this attains the state of Prajapati. O Soma, with your variegated powers, you pervade all the poetic (verses), you are the ocean-like (verses). "You" is the form of Brihat. This is the Brihat day.
3.20.14	"He is the foremost, he is the foremost, the one who speaks, the one who sings." This is the foremost day.
3.20.15	This is the second day, and it is called the foremost.
3.20.16	"These worlds are for you, O sage, for your greatness, O Soma, they stand firm."
3.20.17	This day is like a running horse, because it is the Bharata day.
3.20.18	For the Bharata is great.
3.20.19	That (verse) which is 'O Soma, that which is thy greatness, is firm', is for the approaching of the day.
3.20.20	'The cows run to thee' is for the whole.
3.21.1	These are the Gāyatrī verses, in the form of the Triṣṭubh, having attained prosperity.
3.21.2	Where they attain prosperity by the form of the day, there they attain prosperity.
3.21.3	He who knows thus attains prosperity.
3.21.4	"Flow, O Indra, as a bull, the pressed (Soma),"-the Anurūpa (verse) is in the form of a bull.
3.21.5	This is the eighth day.
3.21.6	The Tristubh is the form of the Kshatra.
3.21.7	They say, "They begin with the form of the day, with the Stotriya (verse) and the Anurūpa Sāman."
3.21.8	The Stotriya and Anurūpa verses are used.
3.21.9	The Stotriya and Anurūpa are the two Sāmans.
3.21.10	The Stotriya and the Anurūpa Sāmans are performed.
3.21.11	The Stotrīya is Prāṇa and the Anurāpa is Apāna.
3.21.12	They prosper and reach the end by means of Prāṇa and Apāna.
3.21.13	The Stotra is the mind and the Anurāja is speech.
3.21.14	The Stoma is the Sāman and the Anurājā is the Ṛk.
3.21.15	The Stotriya is the day, the Anurūpa is the night.
3.21.16	This one is the Stotriya, that one is the Anurūpā.
3.21.17	The Stotriya is one's own self, the Anurupa is progeny.
3.21.18	The Stotrīya and Anurūpa are indeed the forms of that by which one speaks the best words and the worst words. By which the doer and the instrument are known to be similar.
3.21.19	Because of the similarity between the Stotriya and Anurūpa, the offspring are similar.
3.21.20	One who knows this is born as a similar offspring.
3.21.21	They say, "Those who interrupt the verses of the Pravargya day are indeed deprived of life."
3.21.22	Here they perform five continuous verses for the continuity and uninterruptedness of the vital airs.
3.21.23	All become endowed with testicles.
3.21.24	This is the Bharata day.
3.21.25	The Tristubh is the form of the Kshatra.
3.21.26	There is a Parayasa (verse) for the stability of offspring and the presence of cattle.
3.21.27	The Stoma is fifteenfold. The fifteenfold is power and virility. They proceed, having attained power and virilitya.
3.22.1-7	Agni is the messenger, we choose him. The ghee offering is dedicated to Agni. Some seers saw him when he went away, others when he came back. Then this (verse) is neither when he went away nor when he came back.
3.22.8	He who knows this attains the status of Prajapati.
3.22.9	"Hotr, the knower of all,
3.22.10	" Ho is the form of Brihat.
3.22.11	This is the Brihat day.
3.22.12	We call Mitra, Indra, the singers, the great, Indra and Agni, the great. The oblations are of one form, all are Brihat.
3.22.13	This is the Ksatra day.
3.22.14	Therefore all kings have one mantra, one utterance.
3.22.15	Two are Mahdvatī, two are Bṛhatvatī.
3.22.16	This is the direct form of Bṛhat, that which is great, that which is large.
3.22.17	They directly attain the greatness.
3.22.18	It is of fifteen Stoma. The fifteen Stoma is the strength and power of Indra. They go on attaining the strength and power in Indra.
3.23.1	"The verse, "Flow on, O bull, the holder," is sung in the Madhyandin Pavamana. The Gāyatra verses are sung in the form of a bull."
3.23.2	This is the Bharata day.
3.23.3	The Tristubh is the form of the Ksatra.
3.23.4	And to Marutvat, and to Matasar. Thus they become Marutvatis.
3.23.5	Marutvat is the form of midday.
3.23.6	They do not go beyond the form of midday itself.
3.23.7	You are the supporter of the two worlds. Thus (the verse) is for the support of the day.
3.23.8	Flow, O Hari, with the mind of the drinker, with the support. Thus they become Harivatis.
3.23.9	Harivat is the form (of the verse) in Trishtubh.
3.23.10	This is the Tristubh day.
3.23.11	The Gayatri verses in them are as described in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.23.12	Then the Uktaśva hymn became the Pariṣṭhū, with the Bāṛhaspatya Sāman.
3.23.13	Therefore, it is performed on the Bāṛhaṣpatya day.
3.23.14	Vasishtha was the priest of King Sudāsa Paijavana of the Ikshvāku dynasty.
3.23.15	He, the Suta, Paijavana, placed the Vada-cows in Vasishtha, as one places them in a Purohita.
3.23.16	Vasishtha, having yoked his horses, said to his younger brother Yuktasva, "Let him be the overseer of our wives."
3.23.17	Yuktasva took away the young ones of the Vada-cow of the king.
3.23.18	Those who were good, he kept for himself.
3.23.19	Those who were worse, he put in the royal cow-pen.
3.23.20	They understood that, and said, "The children are born, let us reverse it."
3.23.21	They afflicted him, saying, "He is a thief, he is not a sage."
3.23.22	He desired, "May I find faith, may they not call me."
3.23.23	He saw this Sama.
3.23.24	He praised with it.
3.24.1	It came to an end with "O! fever!"
3.24.2	Then he found the invocation of faith.
3.24.3	They sit for a sacrifice with the aim of finding faith.
3.24.4	They find faith itself.
3.24.5	This indeed is the truth of speech, namely, 'O fever!'
3.24.6	Fever indeed is the truth that suddenly comes.
3.24.7	By means of truth, he found the invocation to faith of speech.
3.24.8	He who knows this becomes worthy of faith, and obtains the sacrifice.
3.24.9	This is the Prajanishnu-pashaviya Saman.
3.24.10	The Nidhana is "O! fever."
3.24.11	They say that the animal being driven away is "ajyata."
3.24.12	The animals of him who knows this become free from fever and prolific.
3.24.13	Because Yuktasva saw it, therefore it is called "Yuktasva."
3.24.14	Soma, thou art purifying, thou art bearing. The Brihatī has both forms.
3.24.15	This is indeed both Sāman-s.
3.24.16	Therefore they perform it. They perform the Brihat and the Rathantara.
3.24.17	The Soma-sāman is performed in them. It is in the Barhaspatya.
3.24.18	Therefore it is performed on the Barhaspaty-day.
3.24.19	Soma is the bull, Indra is the bull-king, this is the Indra day.
3.24.20	Soma is the nobility, Indra is the nobility, this is the day of Indra.
3.24.21	Soma is seed, this is the procreative day.
3.24.22	That these two Sāmans are performed on this day, seed is indeed sown in procreation.
3.24.23	He who knows this, his seed is sown by Prajapati.
3.24.24	The other is the form of the Brihat, on the Brihat day.
3.24.25	The other is the form for the Madhyandin Pavamāna, with three Nidhanas, for stability.
3.24.26	What Soma, the king, saw, that is why they are called Soma-samanis.
3.24.27	"The bull, the red one, thunders forth to the cows." They are with the masculine (syllables).
3.24.28	The Barhaspatya day is the Trishtup metre, the form of the Kshatriya.
3.25.1	In that (day) the Partha (Sāman) with two Yajus-verses became the form of the second day, the Barhaspatya.
3.25.2	Therefore it is performed on the Barhaspatyam day.
3.25.3	Vainya Prithu desired, 'May I be king of all animals.'
3.25.4	He saw this Sama.
3.25.5	He praised with it.
3.25.6	Then he is consecrated for the kingship of all animals.
3.25.7	This is the prosperity of the Sāman.
3.25.8	He who knows this is consecrated for the kingdom of all animals. This is the Sāman of the Stobha-prasthāna.
3.25.9	It is the Svaras, for the division of Svaras.
3.25.10	For this is the Svaras of this day, namely the Stobha- prasthāna.
3.25.11	This day is like the highest (heaven). This Sāman is like the highest.
3.25.12	One who praises with this (Sāman) indeed rises up like the day.
3.25.13	Because Vainya of Pṛthu saw (this Sāman), therefore it is called Pārtha.
3.26.1	But they say that Vasīṣṭha is more appropriate.
3.26.2	This is the Kshatra, because it is Partha; this is the Kshattra, because it is Soma-saman; this is the day, this is the Ksatra, because it is Indra; this is the Ksattra, because it has three feet; this is the ksatra, because it has four feet; this is ksatra, because the Stoma is fifteen.
3.26.3	The Kshatra is indeed one.
3.26.4	Now, the reason why the Yaukta-asva (Sâman) is sung first and the Rsi-sâman afterwards is that the Brahman may be well-established.
3.26.5	"Brahman and Kshatra are united in one."
3.26.6	Vasishtha, having lost his son, desired, "May I beget many children and cattle."
3.26.7	He saw this Sâman.
3.26.8	He praised with it.
3.26.9	Then he, being many, is born with offspring and cattle.
3.26.10	This is the generative Sama.
3.26.11	He who knows this is born with offspring, with cattle.
3.26.12	Because Vasishtha saw it, therefore it is called Vasishtha.
3.26.13	Now the Brihat.
3.26.14	The Brihat is the armour.
3.26.15	They go to the armour, indeed, standing firm.
3.26.16	Then the Vamadevya.
3.26.17	The Vamadevya is indeed cattle.
3.26.18	By praising with this one becomes possessed of cattle.
3.26.19	Then the Shiti, the union of the Samas, the continuity of the sacrifice.
3.26.20	"It is said, "One brings you, O man, now."
3.26.21	The second day is performed with that very (verse).
3.27.1	Among them the Madhuccandasa.
3.27.2	Madhuccanda, the son of Vaishvamitra, desired, "May I be the foremost, the chief, the most brilliant."
3.27.3	He saw this Sama.
3.27.4	He praised with it.
3.27.5	Then he became the foremost, the most brilliant.
3.27.6	They perform a sacrifice with the intention, "We will be the foremost, chief, and most brilliant."
3.27.7	They indeed become the foremost, chief and most brilliant.
3.27.8	Now, Madhuccanda Vaishvamitra saw it, and therefore it is called Madhuccanda.
3.27.9	It is a chant for the Ida-priest.
3.27.10	Ida means cattle.
3.27.11	They thus establish themselves in cattle.
3.28.1	"The verse "Which is thy best intoxicating drink" is sung in the Pavamana of the Arbhava.
3.28.2	Intoxicating drink means juice.
3.28.3	This is as it were the third pressing.
3.28.4	In that they are full of Soma, they put juice into it, and thus they make it grow.
3.28.5	"One should press with the verse, 'Do thou press for the shining one.' They should be verses containing the word 'shining' (anghara). Food is shining; for the securing of food.
3.28.6	He struck down Vritra, the enemy. This is the Tristubh form.
3.28.7	Whatever is like a striking, that is the Tristubha form.
3.28.8	For the Tristubh is the Kshatra.
3.28.9	The tawny one, the mixed one, is with the well-standing cows. This is like a running day, for the Bharata day is like a running.
3.28.10	For the Bharata is great.
3.28.11	Now, the reason why it is said, 'with the Sūpasthā hymns' is that they are recited at the time of the Sūpastha (rite).
3.28.12	Among them, the Gāyatrī hymn is as mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.28.13	Then the Hāviṣmat hymn became the Pariṣṭhūbha, with the Bahīrniṣadha metre, and the Bāhrata metre.
3.28.14	Therefore, it is performed on the Bāhrate day.
3.28.15	Haviṣmat and Haviṣkṛt, the sons of Angiras, went to the heavenly world of the Angiras, but they lost it.
3.28.16	They desired to ascend to heaven, to go to heaven, to not fall.
3.28.17	They desired to ascend to the heavenly world.
3.28.18	They performed austerities.
3.28.19	They saw these two Sāman chants.
3.28.20	They praised with them.
3.28.21	Having praised, they ascended to the heavenly world, as if having offered oblations to the one who deserves oblations.
3.28.22	The animals are indeed the sacrificers, the animals are the performers of sacrifice.
3.28.23	They obtained the animals through these two.
3.28.24	Having performed sacrifices with those animals, they went to heaven.
3.28.25	These two are the animal-obtaining, heavenly Sāman songs.
3.28.26	He who knows this obtains animals and goes to heaven.
3.29.1	And indeed, these two verses are the statement and the explanation of the oblation.
3.29.2	And because the second day is called "having oblations," they say to the gods, "We have oblations."
3.29.3	For now they are like those who have oblations.
3.29.4	Now, what is done on the ninth day is called Havis-krit. Thus they offered to the gods without any hesitation.
3.29.5	For then they were like Havis-krita.
3.29.6	These two are the two verses of praise, namely, the praise of the Havis and the praise of the gods.
3.29.7	The reason why the two Angiras, Havishmat and Havishkrit, are called by these names is that they saw this.
3.29.8	"O Soma, flow forth most sweet!" The directions become sweet.
3.29.9	Juice is indeed intoxication.
3.29.10	The third pressing is like a daughter.
3.29.11	And in that they are sweet, they put juice into it, and thus they nourish it.
3.29.12	"Soma, the most seasonal, is the drink for Indra."
3.29.13	"The most powerful drink is the great one."
3.29.14	Thus they put juice and drink into it, in the order of the verses.
3.30.1	In them the Sīdanti (verse) is recited.
3.30.2	The gods desired, "May we attain heaven."
3.30.3	They saw this Sama.
3.30.4	They praised with it.
3.30.5	Then indeed they attained the heavenly world.
3.30.6	They sit for a Sattra, saying, "We shall attain the heavenly world."
3.30.7	They indeed attain the heavenly world. 
3.30.8	Because the gods attained the heavenly world with this Sama, therefore it is called "Sida."
3.30.9	They indeed call it "Sankva."
3.30.10	The Sanku-s secure it because it is the Dadhiṣeṇya.
3.30.11	This day is like the Dadhiṣenya, because it is the second.
3.30.12	Therefore it is performed on the second day.
3.30.13	"These strong ones go to Indra, the strong one,
3.30.14	The born Indras, the knowers of heaven."
3.30.15	Thus the first day is performed like heaven by a verse. This is done by a Saman.
3.30.16	The Rathantara is the first day, the Bharata is this one.
3.31.1	In them, the knowledge is well-known.
3.31.2	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a battle. The gods, having assumed the form of the gods, entered them and attacked the gods who were reciting the Vedas in the forest.
3.31.3	Those who were in the village, they attacked them with that form.
3.31.4	Then those who were in the villages and those who were in forests, reciting the Veda, they sought to kill them by their forms.
3.31.5	They sought to kill them in the form of a wild boar.
3.31.6	The gods recognized them.
3.31.7	They said, "Let us recite together."
3.31.8	They consulted together, saying, "When we ask him who is going, 'Whom do you go to?' he should say, 'I go to Indra.'"
3.31.9	When they asked him who was going, 'Whom are you going to?' he said, 'I am going to Indra.'
3.31.10	They said, 'You are well-known.'
3.31.11	That is the reason for his being well-known.
3.31.12	This is the well-known Samaveda.
3.31.13	He who knows this, he becomes what he desires to be by that.
3.31.14	Of those who know this, he who is asked about something and does not answer, his own is destroyed.
3.31.15	This is indeed the destruction of the enemy.
3.31.16	He who knows this destroys his hateful enemy.
3.31.17	The gods, going to the heavenly world, were afraid of knowledge.
3.31.18	They desired, "May knowledge manifest itself."
3.31.19	They saw this Sama.
3.31.20	They praised with it.
3.31.21	Then indeed knowledge manifested itself for them.
3.31.22	Knowledge manifests itself for him who knows thus.
3.31.23	This Pūṣan, the wealth, the lord, Soma, being purified, flows.
3.31.24	The lord of all beings has proclaimed both the heavens and the earth.
3.31.25	Thus for the commencement of both days.
3.31.26	Just as one would lead a tired person, so does this day lead those two days. The Barhaspatya and Rathantara are led by it.
3.31.27	In them, the story of the cow is told.
3.32.1	Now the Krouncha.
3.32.2	Krouncha Angirasa found the day called "Krouncha".
3.32.3	This day is as if it were the second.
3.32.4	Therefore, it is performed on the second day.
3.32.5	There was only one day.
3.32.6	Aṅgiras desired, "May I create a day from the day."
3.32.7	He saw this Sama.
3.32.8	He praised with it.
3.32.9	Then he created a day from the one day.
3.32.10	Now, that this is the Sama, it is indeed with this that the day is created.
3.32.11	Now, that which is known as the Krung Angirasa, it is indeed the day that is created by the day.
3.32.12	What is said here, that the Krung drank milk, it is not that the Krung actually drank.
3.32.13	The Krung Angirasas indeed drank the day.
3.32.14	Krūṃṅ Āṅgirase, desiring heaven, performed austerities.
3.32.15	He saw this Sama.
3.32.16	He praised with it.
3.32.17	Then he attained heaven.
3.32.18	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.32.19	One who knows this attains heaven.
3.32.20	This becomes the upper form of the Brihat, on the Brihat day.
3.32.21	With that, the form is enriched.
3.32.22	Because the Angiras saw it, therefore it is called the Krouncha.
3.32.23	"The bull of the minds flows, the discerning one." They are Vrusanvatis.
3.32.24	This is the Bharata day, the Trishubha form of the Kshatriya.
3.33.1	In those (verses) is the Yama.
3.33.2	This is as it were the Yama day, the second.
3.33.3	Just as the twins were born, so is this day.
3.33.4	By means of the Yama-s, Yama, having restrained the worlds with the sound of his departure, ascended the world of this one.
3.33.5	One who knows this, restrains the world of his enemy, the hater, and ascends the world of this (Yama).
3.33.6	The sages with the mantra, Yama with the Yama-s.
3.33.7	They sit in the sacrifice with the intention of restraining.
3.33.8	They are indeed the basis.
3.33.9	The house is the basis, the offspring is the basis, cattle is the basis, heaven is the basis.
3.33.10	One who knows this becomes the basis.
3.33.11	Yama Vaivasvata was not well-provided for the world beyond by the gods.
3.33.12	He desired, "May I be the basis in this world."
3.33.13	He saw these Yama hymns.
3.33.14	He praised with them.
3.33.15	By them he became the bestower of gifts in this world.
3.33.16	This is the reason why he became the bestowal of gifts in this life.
3.33.17	He who knows these Sama-s, by them he becomes the bestower of blessings in this world. He who knows this becomes the son of Yama.
3.33.18	They say that the Sama-s are connected with the Pitrs.
3.33.19	The Lord, in the past, went to this world from the other world. Therefore, it is called 'Ayus' (life). Or it is called 'Vayu' (wind).
3.33.20	Thus, in the past one does not go to this world from there.
3.33.21	Because Yama saw it, it is known as 'Yamam'.
3.33.22	Now, the Yajnayajniya with the stated Brahmanas.
3.33.23	Come, I will tell you these words of Agni.
3.33.24	With these increasing Indras.
3.33.25	For this is the increased day, namely the Bharata.
3.34.1	In them is the horse-sacrifice, the heavenly Sama, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
3.34.2	For you are indeed the hero-bestower. The word "indeed" is the form of the Brihat.
3.34.3	This is the Bharata day.
3.34.4-10	In them the Prajapati-sāman is the Amahīyava. Prajapati is the Kshatra. This day is Prajapati. It is in the Gāyatrī verses. Brahma is the Gāyatrīs. This day belongs to Kshatra. Therefore, when it is in the Gãyatrīs, it is the Amahĩyava, then they make Brahma shine with glory.
3.34.11	The light of this true Brahman shines forth for him who knows thus, as the light of the king shines forth for the Brahmanas.
3.34.12	For from this (Brahman) indeed shines forth the light of the Brahmanas, as of the kings, when the Gathas are the Brahma-saman.
3.34.13	It is the same thing that is said in them.
3.34.14	What many people say to be the same is true.
3.34.15	And what is that?
3.34.16	For you are the hero, you are the one without fear, you are the steadfast one.
3.34.17	May your mind be favorable to us.
3.34.18	This is said for the sake of the truth's prosperity.
3.34.19	They increased Indra, the one who is growing, for this day is indeed growing, namely the Bharata day.
3.34.20	In them, the eighteen-toothed one is mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.34.21	That is the Iḍa, the Acchāvāka Sāman.
3.34.22	Cattle are Iḍa.
3.34.23	They thus establish themselves in the animals.
3.34.24	The third day is sung with the voice of Abhiḍā.
3.35.1	The verses are in the form of Da-vidyuttyā ruce.
3.35.2	Da-vidyuttya ruce is the form of Gāyatrī.
3.35.3	Pariṣṭobhantyā krpe is of Tristubh.
3.35.4	Somas śukrā gāvaśire is of Jagatī.
3.35.5	The form of the metres is the metres, the third pressing is done with the metres.
3.35.6	The third pressing is like the third day.
3.35.7	These are the verses: Gāyatrī verses of the Jagat class, prosperous in the form of the day.
3.35.8	Where they prosper in the form of a day, there they prosper.
3.35.9	He prospers who knows thus.
3.35.10	These are the drops of Indra. The Anurūpa (verse) is recited.
3.35.11	These are the verses that follow the Bhūtas. They recite the earlier ones.
3.35.12	They go by the Brihat and Rathantara (verses) to the Stoma of three and fifteen verses.
3.35.13	They say, "They begin with the form of the Saman, with the Stotriya (verse) and conclude with the Anurūpa."
3.35.14	They become the Stotriya and Anurūpa.
3.35.15	Prāṇa is the Stotriya, Apāna is the Anurūpa;
3.35.16	They prosper through Prāṇa and Apāna.
3.36.1	They become the cows, the sheep, the horses, the cattle; for the securing of cattle.
3.36.2	For cattle is this day.
3.36.3	They become those having all (kinds of) cattle.
3.36.4	This is the day of the Visvadevatās.
3.36.5	They are Antarikṣavati (belonging to the atmosphere).
3.36.6	This is the day of Antarikṣa.
3.36.7	They are Āśīrvati (containing blessings).
3.36.8	This is a day of blessings.
3.36.9	Moreover, they bring down the blessings at the third pressing.
3.36.10	This is the third pressing. This is the day belonging to the third pressing.
3.36.11	It consists of five verses, because there are five directions; for the sake of the stability of the directions.
3.36.12	It is a fivefold sacrifice, for the sake of beginning the sacrifice.
3.36.13	It is an encircling (verse), for the stability of offspring, for the presence of cattle.
3.36.14	It consists of seventeen verses,
3.36.15	because Prajapati is seventeenfold.
3.36.16	They proceed in him, being established in Prajapati.
3.37.1	The offering of ghee is to Agni, with the verse, "Agni is kindled by Agni." It is to be offered to Agni. The Rathantara is the tune.
3.37.2	For this day is indeed Rathantara.
3.37.3	When Agni is kindled by Agni, it is indeed Vaivāhika. When it is kindled by Rathantara, it is indeed Rathantara.
3.37.4	His wife said, "If my husband had thought of me as two backs, then this donkey would not have brayed at the Udumbara tree."
3.37.5	This is called the Rathantara day.
3.37.6	Therefore, the Rathantara is to be sung on this day.
3.37.7	They say, "Who is that man? Who is that person who is like the self and not like cattle?"
3.37.8	The self is the Brihat and Rathantara.
3.37.9	The cattle are the Prstha.
3.37.10	Therefore, the Prstha of this day should be done in a mixed way."
3.37.11	When the Prstha is done in a mixed manner on this day, they establish the cattle in the self.
3.38.1	"He invokes Mitra, the pure-minded one" - this is for the Maitrāvaruṇa.
3.38.2	"Hū" is the form of the Rathantara.
3.38.3	This is the Rathantara day.
3.38.4	"They accomplish Varuna and the giver of riches, the truthful Ghrtachi" - for accomplishment.
3.38.5	"Mitra and Varuna, the truthful ones, the truthful ones who increase truthfulness,"
3.38.6	"They seek the great season."
3.38.7-13	The poets are our Mitra and Varuna. Thus it becomes the form of the atmosphere. This day is the receptacle of the atmosphere. It is Indra's, for you are united with Indra. Thus it becomes Indra's. For 'united' and 'thus' are the forms of the atmosphere. This is the upper world from here, the lower one from there. For 'thus' and 'united' are the atmosphere.
3.38.14-18	"The one who is born together with the one who is not afraid, with the one of equal lustre." The third and fourth days are indeed equal. The fourth day is born from the third day. "The fourth day is indeed born from the third. The third day is born from this one." "They again seek the state of embryo on the third day for the birth of the fourth day." "They establish the sacrificial name."
3.38.19	The Veda, the Veda, the Veda! The Veda, the shining, the shining, shining! The Veda, shining, shining, shining!
3.38.20	The Veda, the Veda of the Usriyas.
3.38.21	Thus they are connected with cattle and animals, for the securing of animals.
3.38.22	For animals is this day.
3.39.1	"He invokes the two whose this is." It is connected with Indra and Agni.
3.39.2	They offer the speech itself as the sacrifice. They invoke it with the verse, "May the entire world come to us, the one created in the past."
3.39.3	For now it is indeed created in the past.
3.39.4	Indra and Agni, not apart from each other,
3.39.5	The fierce ones, the destroyers of enemies.
3.39.6	Thus it is said.
3.39.7	It becomes the form of the atmosphere.
3.39.8	This day is the receptacle of the atmosphere.
3.39.9-13	With his hand he has conquered the Vritras, with his hand the Dasa-s, with his hand all the foes. Thus it is the slayer of Vritra. It is at the end (of the sacrifice) for victory. By this three-day (rite) the gods won (the war) in the beginning. That which is the slayer of Vrtra, the butter at the end, is done for victory, for the killing of the enemy.
3.39.14	He who knows this conquers and destroys his enemies.
3.39.15	The Stoma is seventeen.
3.39.16	Prajapati is seventeen.
3.39.17	They proceed in Prajapati.
3.40.1	The Gāyatrī verses of the Madhyandina Pavamāna are those which have the word "food" in them. Food is nourishment. For the securing of food.
3.40.2	"The heaven and earth give in heaven and on earth." They become connected with heaven and earth.
3.40.3	The day on which the Vairūpa rite is performed is indeed like an unstable (day).
3.40.4	Therefore, since they become connected with heaven, and earth, they establish this day with them.
3.40.5	"To Indra, to Yajya, to Varuna, to the Maruts." They become connected to the Maruts.
3.40.6	The form of Madhyandin is like that of Maruts.
3.40.7	They do not go beyond the form of Madhyandina.
3.40.8	"They are called "all-pervading", because they pervade all.
3.40.9	For this day is indeed devoted to all gods."
3.40.10	In them, the Gayatri verse is as explained in the Brahmanas.
3.40.11	Now the Vaisthambha (verses).
3.40.12	The gods went upwards to the heavenly world.
3.40.13	They did not see the directions.
3.40.14	They desired, "May we see the directions."
3.40.15	They saw these two Sāmans.
3.40.16	They praised with them.
3.40.17	Then they saw the directions.
3.40.18	They stepped into them.
3.40.19	They seemed to be united with them.
3.40.20	They were united with them by these two concluding verses, just as one would unite a piece of leather with two straps.
3.40.21	They were established.
3.40.22	Now, the reason why these two Sāman-chants are performed is that (they are performed) for the sake of the stability of the directions and for the conquest of the heavenly world.
3.40.23	These two Sāman chants are indeed the directions.
3.40.24	The reason why these two Saman-chants are performed on this day is that they directly undertake the directions.
3.40.25	"The Soma-pressers have come forth" - this is the form of Rathantara.
3.40.26	This day is Rathantara.
3.41.1	Whatever the gods did at the sacrifice, the Asuras followed that.
3.41.2	The gods said: Whatever we do at the sacrifice, that the Asuras follow.
3.41.3	Let us mix this Triveda with a verse.
3.41.4	They mixed the Triveda with a single verse.
3.41.5	The Asuras said, "This is not the one who was struck by the verse."
3.41.6	"Let us abandon him!"
3.41.7	They abandoned him.
3.41.8	The gods extracted the essence from that inferior one for the verse.
3.41.9	That became the Pragaatha.
3.41.10	The fact that they extracted the essence for the verse is the Pragaatha's Pragaatha-ness.
3.41.11	This is indeed the firm essence.
3.41.12	One is praised by means of essence, he who knowing thus praises with a Prāgātha.
3.41.13	And indeed the Rk and the Gāthā were similar to each other, but one was superior to the other.
3.41.14	They ran a race.
3.41.15	It (the Rk) pushed the essence of the Gāthās.
3.41.16	It became this Prāgāthā.
3.41.17	The reason why the Gāthā is so called is that it is the essence of the Prāgātha.
3.41.18	This essence is indeed firm.
3.41.19	He who, knowing this, praises with the Prāgâtha, is praised by the essence.
3.42.1	In it the gods saw the food of Viraj, the pair, the begetting.
3.42.2	Now, the first verse has four feet, the next two verses have three feet each, making ten feet in all.
3.42.3	The Viraj has ten syllables, and Viraj is food.
3.42.4	They saw this.
3.42.5	Now, if they call the first verse Brihatī and the next two verses Prathā, then that is a pair, and procreation is a pair.
3.42.6	In that (sacrifice) indeed Vasistha saw Viraj, the food, consisting of four feet, a pair, and reproduction.
3.42.7	That which has four feet in the beginning and two feet in the last three (verses), those ten feet are completed.
3.42.8	Viraj has ten syllables, food is Viraj.
3.42.9	He saw this.
3.42.10-13	One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That is the Viraj. One, two, three; four, five, and six; seven, eight, and nine; ten. This is the fourfold pair, the begetting. He who knows this is born through the pair.
3.43.1	Among them, the Pārumudga.
3.43.2	The Pavamāna is performed with the Pārumugga.
3.43.3	Purumudga Āṅgirasa, desiring cattle, practised austerity.
3.43.4	He saw this Sama.
3.43.5	He praised with it.
3.43.6	He approached this Ida.
3.43.7	Ida is cattle.
3.43.8	From there he obtained cattle.
3.43.9	This is the cattle-winning Sama.
3.43.10	Now he binds the animals. He who knows this becomes one with many animals.
3.43.11	Because Purumudga Angiras saw it, therefore it is called Paurumudga.
3.43.12	The gods and the Asuras competed for the ocean.
3.43.13	The gods desired, "We should drown the Asuras in the ocean first."
3.43.14	They saw this Sama.
3.43.15	They praised with it.
3.43.16	He thereby drowned the Asuras in the east.
3.43.17	In that he drowned them in the east, that is why the Purumudga is called Purumudga.
3.43.18	He who knows this drowns his hateful enemy in the east. He who drowns him in the east,
3.43.19	he strikes him with this very hymn.
3.43.20	It is indeed the destroyer of enemies.
3.43.21	Why is this called the Sama of the Rakshas?
3.43.22	They struck them as if they were Rakshas.
3.43.23	He who knows this strikes his enemy, his foe, the Rakshas, the evil one.
3.44.1	Then the Gautama.
3.44.2	Both castes for prosperity, the Barhaspatya with the Pratihara, the Rathantara above.
3.44.3	Rāhugaṇa Gautama desired, "May I be the one who bestows happiness."
3.44.4	He saw this Sama Veda.
3.44.5	He praised with it.
3.44.6	Then he became the one who bestowed happiness.
3.44.7	They perform the Sattra with the Sama Veda of the one who bestoWS happiness.
3.44.8	They become the one who bestoWs happiness.
3.44.9	Those who are the Rṣis of Gotama, whether they are from the east or the west, they both worship Gotama the Rṣi.
3.44.10	For he saw his greatness.
3.44.11	Those who are the ancestors of him, whether they are in the east or the east, they both worship him who knows thus.
3.44.12	Because Rāhugaṇa saw it, therefore it is called Gautama.
3.45.1	Now about the atmosphere.
3.45.2	The Asuras struck the gods who had gone to the atmosphere.
3.45.3	They desired: "We shall ascend to heaven by conquering the atmosphere with the atmosphere."
3.45.4	They saw this Sama.
3.45.5	They praised with it.
3.45.6	Then they conquered the space from the space itself and ascended to the heavenly world.
3.45.7	That itself is the space-ness of space.
3.45.8	This is the conquering, heavenly Sāman.
3.45.9	He who knows this conquers and goes to heaven.
3.45.10	This is indeed the space day.
3.45.11	Space is indeed like a creeper.
3.45.12	That it has a middle-ending is for the sake of stability.
3.45.13	He presses the two feet of it, the form of the atmosphere.
3.45.14	For the atmosphere is pressed on both sides by these two worlds.
3.45.15	Therefore this is the Sāman, therefore it is not interrupted from this day.
3.45.16	This is the atmosphere, this is the Sāmā.
3.45.17	One who is satisfied with it rises up on this day.
3.45.18	The gods, having conquered the atmosphere by this Sama, ascended to heaven. Therefore, it is called atmosphere.
3.46.1	Now the Kanva.
3.46.2	Kanva, the son of Naras, wandering without a fixed abode, desired, "May I be established."
3.46.3	He saw this Sama.
3.46.4	He did not see its conclusion.
3.46.5	He heard it from the one who was born as a bull.
3.46.6	He saw it.
3.46.7	He praised it.
3.46.8	Then he stood firm.
3.46.9	This is the Pratisthā Sāman.
3.46.10	One who knows this stands firm.
3.46.11	What Kanva, the son of Ṛṣa, saw, therefore it is called Kaṇva.
3.46.12	The three verses are recited with the three accents. The last three verses are in Tristubh metre, the form of the third pressing.
3.46.13	The three days are completed by that.
3.46.14	The intention of truth, the thought of Brahman,
3.46.15	The cows go to the lord of cows, asking questions. The thoughts go to Soma, eager.
3.46.16	Thus they are the cows and the animals. They are for the securing of animals.
3.46.17	For this day is indeed the animals.
3.47.1	In them is the Sankośa (hymn).
3.47.2	By means of the Sankośas the gods, crying out, went to the heavenly world.
3.47.3	In that they went to the heavenly worlds crying out, that is the Sankoša's Sankoša-ness.
3.47.4	This is the heavenly Sāman.
3.47.5	He who knows this, indeed, goes to heaven by crying out.
3.47.6	They call it the cry of the Angirasas.
3.47.7	The Angirasas desired: "We shall go to heaven by crying together."
3.47.8	They saw this Sama.
3.47.9	They praised with it.
3.47.10	Then they went to heaven by crying and being together.
3.47.11	The one who, crying, goes to the heavenly world, that is the very crying and crying-ness of the Sankrusa.
3.47.12	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.47.13	One who knows this indeed goes to the heavenly worlds by crying.
3.47.14	This is indeed the heaven.
3.47.15	One who thus knows attains heaven and goes to the heavenly realm.
3.47.16	Because the Angirasas saw this, it is called the Angirasa-sankrośa.
3.47.17	And indeed, these two verses are the two Sama-s, namely, Hutis and Prati-shruti. The Angirasas called out with the words "Ha va ha" and "Ha ho ha ho".
3.47.18	They listened with the words "ha va o va".
3.47.19	They are indeed the two hymns, namely, the Hotr and the Prati-srutr, for the attainment of heaven, for the attainment (of heaven) of the heavenly world.
3.48.1	"If a hundred heavens and a hundred earths were thine, O Indra,
3.48.2	Thou wouldst not be able to bear the thousand suns."
3.48.3	What is a hundredfold and a thousandfold, that is the form of the Jagati.
3.48.4	This is the Jagati day.
3.48.5	"The eight regions are not born." These indeed are the eight regions.
3.48.6	He indeed speaks of these.
3.48.7	"The bull, the most powerful, has attained greatness for power, for strength." They become universal.
3.48.8	For this is the day of Visve Devāḥ.
3.48.9	O Maghavan, in the herd of cows, with your variegated powers, you are the protector. The cows are the cattle, they are the cattle-possessors, for the securing of cattle.
3.48.10	For this day is indeed cattle.
3.48.11	In them there is irregularity.
3.48.12	The year is irregular, the seasons are irregular, the half-months are irregular,
3.48.13	Now, the sacrifice is fivefold, the seasons are five, the sacrifice is twelvefold, the months are twelve, it is in the form of the directions, it is in form of the attack, thereby it is in the shape of the universe, for this day is universal.
3.48.14	This is the creation of the Vairūpa sacrifice.
3.48.15	It is performed on the third day for the prosperity of the fourth day.
3.48.16	When the gods became, the Asuras became.
3.48.17	Those gods became horses; the Asuras did not follow them.
3.48.18	Then indeed the gods became victorious, the Asuras were defeated.
3.48.19	One becomes victorious over one's own self, one's enemy becomes defeated, he who knows this.
3.49.1	That it is horse-like is for the removal of the enemy.
3.49.2	Half of the third day, half of the fifth day.
3.49.3	He should perform the sacrifice in the same way as a frog croaks.
3.49.4	The fifth day is completed by that alone.
3.49.5	All speech is attained on the third day.
3.49.6	The reason why these two are called Vrkana is that both kinds of speech are attained, namely, that which is of the village and that which is of wilderness.
3.50.1	There is a prohibition against them.
3.50.2	The gods, by means of the Vaisṭambha (rite), having driven away the Asuras from these worlds, performed the Sattra in their own abode.
3.50.3	He who knows this, by means of Vaisṭambhas (rites), drives away his hateful enemy from these worlds and performs the Sattra in his own abode.
3.50.4	This is indeed the name of the Vaisțambha (rite).
3.50.5	It is called Vaisṭambham.
3.50.6	This is the belly day.
3.50.7	Food is what is firm.
3.50.8	What is firm here is made, in the middle of the self, they place food.
3.50.9	Therefore this man is as if firm with food.
3.50.10	The Stotriya verses are known as "The one who seeks to cross."
3.50.11	In them, the Rauravas are the form of the third day, with three forms and three repetitions.
3.50.12	Agni is the roaring one, Agni is Rudra.
3.50.13	From whom cattle depart, Agni makes them depart.
3.50.14	And from whom cattle approach, Agni makes them approach.
3.50.15	The Agniya Satrins (priests) obtain cattle from their own deities.
3.50.16	That is the Iḍa-sāman for the Acchāvāka.
3.50.17	The Iḍa is indeed cattle.
3.50.18	They indeed establish themselves in cattle.
3.51.1	"Three voices are raised" - the Gāyatrī verses of the Pavamāna Sāman of the Ārbhava (Sāman) are the form of the third day.
3.51.2	By that alone the three days are completed.
3.51.3	The cows are milked, the milkers.
3.51.4	The golden one comes, thundering,
3.51.5	Thus they are the cows and the animals. They are for the securing of animals.
3.51.6	For this day is indeed the animals.
3.51.7	"He follows the Brahman with a cry of "Abhi!" The word "Abhi!" is the form of Rathantara."
3.51.8	This day is indeed Rathantara.
3.51.9	"For the prosperity of the four oceans." This is for the prosperity of the fourth day.
3.51.10	For us, O Soma, from all sides. They become universal.
3.51.11	For this day is indeed universal.
3.51.12	Flow forth, O Soma, with a thousand. What is a hundredfold and a thousandfold, that is the form of the Jagati.
3.51.13	This day is indeed Jagati.
3.51.14	In them, the Gayatri is as explained in the Brahmanas.
3.51.15	Now the Paushtauh.
3.51.16	Pausthauhi Angiras, desiring heaven, practised austerities.
3.51.17	He saw this Sama.
3.51.18	He praised with it.
3.51.19	Then he attained heaven.
3.51.20	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.51.21	He who knows this attains heaven.
3.51.22	Because Pausthauhi Angira saw it, therefore it is called Pausthauhi.
3.51.23	And indeed, these two Sāman-chants, Huuti and Prati-shruti, are the same as the words "Ha O" and "Ha O". The Angirasas called out with this.
3.51.24	They listened with "Ha O" or "Ha O".
3.51.25	These two Sāman chants, Huuti and Pratishruti, are indeed the same as the worlds of heaven and earth for the attainment of the world of heaven.
3.51.26	"May it flow around and sprinkle" - they become Parvati (the pouring down) - the form of the end.
3.51.27	This is the last day.
3.52.1	In them, the speech is the Sama.
3.52.2	Having performed the sacrifice, the gods sit in the sacrifice.
3.52.3	They did not know the heaven world, this third day.
3.52.4	They desired, 'May we know the heaven world and this third day.'
3.52.5	They were approached by the speech singing the Sama.
3.52.6	They saw it.
3.52.7	They praised with it.
3.52.8	By that they prospered.
3.52.9	By that he knows the heaven world, this third day.
3.52.10	This is the prosperity-bestowing, heaven-bestowing Sama.
3.52.11	He who knows this prospers, goes to the heaven world.
3.52.12	What is auspicious and peaceful in speech, that is Sama.
3.52.13	They say, "One speaks Sama."
3.52.14	It is good that he speaks thus. The Sama Veda is indeed the peace of speech. They pacify it for three days with peace and tranquility.
3.52.15	The Sama Veda is indeed that by which one sings. Therefore, it is called the Sama Veda.
3.52.16	"Sit together, O friends, for the one who purifies, for the one singing. The verses become more and more extensive."
3.52.17	Now, the reason why the fourth day is called Pravati is that it is for the sake of propagation.
3.52.18	And the reason why the fifth day is called Parvati is that it represents the end, for this day is the end, and what is the end is the end.
3.52.19	One goes around the end, one goes around the end.
3.53.1	In them there is the Saukta.
3.53.2	The Angirasas, while performing austerities, lamented.
3.53.3	They desired: "May we remove the distress of austerity."
3.53.4	They saw this Sama.
3.53.5	They praised with it.
3.53.6	They removed impurity with it.
3.53.7	That by which they removed impurity, that is the purity of the Shukta.
3.53.8	He who knows this removes impurity.
3.53.9	Shukti Angirasa, desiring heaven, performed austerities.
3.53.10	He saw this Sama. 
3.53.11	He praised with it. 
3.53.12	Then he attained heaven.
3.53.13	This is the heavenly Sāman.
3.53.14	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.53.15	What Shukti Angiras saw, from that it is called Shukti.
3.53.16	The Soma-juices, most intoxicating, for Indra, the loving, are intoxicating.
3.53.17	Juice indeed is intoxication.
3.53.18	The third pressing is like a daughter.
3.53.19	Whatever they are, they are full of Soma. They put the juice into it. They make it grow with this.
3.53.20	"They go to the gods with the purifying (grasses). Let your intoxicants go to you." They put the juice and intoxication into it in the reverse order.
3.53.21	"Indra is being purified for Indra." The gods said this.
3.53.22	The lord of speech, the lord of sacrifice, the lord of all, rules by his power.
3.53.23	Thus they are called 'universal'.
3.53.24	For this is the day of Visvedevas.
3.53.25	The thousand-streamed one flows, the ocean, to make the speech flow. Whatever is a hundredfold or a thousandfold, that is the form of the Jagati.
3.53.26	This is the Jagat day.
3.54.1	In them, the Gaurīvita and the Uktā Brahmanas are mentioned.
3.54.2	Then the Tvashtri-sāman, the sāman that generates heroes.
3.54.3	He who knows this becomes a hero. And for the propagation of the fourth day.
3.54.4	For this is the propagation, namely the Tvashtrisāman.
3.54.5	It becomes the middle-ending, for support.
3.54.6	Those who perform the Pavamāna of the Arnavam (sāman) proceed to the ocean.
3.54.7	Whatever is in the middle, it is for the sake of establishment.
3.54.8	It becomes as if obstructed, the form of the end.
3.54.9	The end is indeed the world of heaven.
3.54.10	This third day is taken for the world of heaven,
3.54.11	And because it becomes as if obstructed it is for not passing beyond the world of heaven.
3.54.12	"Your sacred thread is spread out, O son of Brahma." They become sacred-thread-bearing.
3.54.13	This is as if the sacred thread is spread over the sky.
3.54.14	This day is the receptacle of the sky.
3.54.15	"You seek the limbs from all sides." They become universal.
3.54.16	This day indeed is Vaiśvadevam.
3.54.17	Therefore he does not attain it, but those who are purified and flowing together attain it for the sake of union.
3.54.18	The purifying grass is spread out on the foot of heaven, its threads are shining, they are shining.
3.54.19	His purifying ones, the swift ones, stand on the back of heaven with brilliance.
3.54.20	Thus for the sake of the union of the heavenly world.
3.54.21	The tawny one, the foremost of the dawns, the bull, seeking the strength in the worlds, shines forth.
3.54.22	The fathers, the creators of man, have placed the embryo by their magic.
3.54.23	Thus again on the third day they place the embryo for the continuity of the fourth day.
3.55.1	In them, for the continuity of sacrifice.
3.55.2	Whatever is defective, ill-sung, or ill-performed in the sacrifice, that is indeed for its non-injury.
3.55.3	For the sacrifice is indeed non-injured by this (rite).
3.55.4	The gods performed this twelve-night (rite).
3.55.5	Whatever was defective among them, they made it non-defective by the non-defective (rite).
3.55.6	That is the non-defectiveness of the non-defensive.
3.55.7	One who knows this crosses the evil of twelve nights and attains prosperity.
3.55.8	It is the three Iḍās. The Iḍās are indeed animals.
3.55.9	This day is for the animals. It is for the purpose of securing animals.
3.55.10	Indeed, the three Iḍā are indeed the remedy.
3.55.11	Indeed, these three Iḍā, namely, the three Iṭās, are indeed auspicious and peaceful.
3.55.12	Now, since the third day is the third, they appease the three days by that.
3.55.13	Then the Yajñāyajñiya (hymn) with the explanation given.
3.55.14	"He sings to the most powerful one" - the Pramanshithiyam (hymn) is explained.
3.55.15	"We praise your joy" - they become Madvatis.
3.55.16	They put the juice and the intoxicating drink in the third pressing.
3.55.17	In them is the Brāhmaṇa called the Harivarna.
3.55.18	It has four verses and four feet. Animals have four feet.
3.55.19	Animals are Uṣṇīka. It is for the securing of animals.
3.56.1	"Listen to the call of the one who is on the other side." This is for the one who is across.
3.56.2	Or the gods and the sages conquered the higher worlds.
3.56.3	Then the Angirasas of the west desired: "May we conquer the worlds of the west, by which these waters flow, by which this wind blows, by which the sun moves, by which the moon, by which the stars."
3.56.4	He saw this Sama.
3.56.5	He praised with it.
3.56.6	By that he conquers the worlds of the animals, by that these waters flow, by that this wind blows, by that this sun moves, by that the moon, by that the stars.
3.56.7	Indeed, others conquer the worlds by other rites.
3.56.8	But by this one conquers the worlds both ways, both above and below.
3.56.9	He who knows thus conquers the worlds above and below.
3.56.10-15	The Angirases, the divine seers, desired to obtain cattle and heroes. He saw this Sama. He praised with it. Listen to the call of the Angirases, O Indra, who serves you. You are the great one, the giver of wealth, of good cattle and heroes. Thus he obtained cattle and heroes.
3.56.16-20	That is the growth of heroes and cattle. He who knows this protects heroes and cattle. The name 'Taisam' is derived from what Angiras saw in the past. The gods, indeed, were going to the heavenly world when the demons followed them. They desired, 'How can we kill the demons?'
3.56.21	They saw this Sama.
3.56.22	Having made it the city of the gods, they arranged it crosswise.
3.56.23	With that they destroyed the Rakshas.
3.56.24	That is the destruction of the Rakshas,
3.56.25	he who knows this destroys the Rakshas and evil.
3.56.26	This is the Iḍa Sama of the Acchāvāka.
3.56.27	The Iḍa is cattle, they indeed establish themselves in cattle.
3.57.1	When the sacrifice is performed, the metres are performed, the deities are performed, these worlds are performed. Then by what?
3.57.2	One should say: By speech.
3.57.3	Speech alone remains there. The syllable alone, the three-syllabled one, remains.
3.57.4	That alone is the subsequent three days.
3.57.5	The sacrifice is obtained by the first day, which is the share of the morning pressing, the second day, which is share of the midday pressing, and the third day, which is of the third pressing.
3.57.6	The metres are obtained by the morning pressing, which is in the Gāyatrī metre, the midday pressing, which is the Tristubh metre, and the third pressing, which is Jagatī metre.
3.57.7	The gods are invoked when he says, "The gods are invoked." The morning pressing belongs to the Vasus, the midday pressing to the Rudras, and the third pressing to the Adityas. Thus the gods are invoked.
3.57.8	"These worlds are invoked" when he says this. This is the morning pressing, this is the midday pressing, and this is the third pressing. Thus these worlds are invoked.
3.57.9	The syllable "a" alone remains as the three syllables.
3.57.10	That alone is the subsequent one.
3.57.11	He who knows Indra on the fourth day becomes endowed with the senses.
3.57.12	Speech indeed is Indra on the fourth da
3.57.13	He becomes endowed with the sense who knows thus.
3.58.1	These are the verses: "They come forth like the Ashvins, O Pavamana, like cows." These are the verses of the Pravargya rite.
3.58.2-7	This is the most desirable day. "The word "pre" is the form of the Gāyatrī." They go to the form of the Gayatri. "They approach the form of the Viraj, saying, "They have released the divine, the bearer of milk." This is the Viraj day. "They say, "They have let loose the standing ones from the atmosphere." They are those with the atmosphere.
3.58.8	The third day is the receptacle of the atmosphere.
3.58.9	This is produced from the third day.
3.58.10	"Those who anoint thee, O sage, O wise one," they anoint as if it were produced.
3.58.11	One is born by this day.
3.58.12	"The rays of Pavamāna on both sides," they produce by both these three days.
3.58.13	They generate the former from the latter.
3.58.14	The stars are at the end of the firm one. The firm one is the day, the stars are the metres.
3.58.15	Just as they yoke the oxen when they are tired, so they yoke the metres in the firm ones, in the attained days.
3.58.16	If the purifying (Soma) is rubbed on the pure (Soma), then the purifying (Soma), indeed, is rubbed on the born (Soma).
3.58.17	It is by this day that it is born.
3.58.18	"It settles in the womb, in the vessels," thus they directly refer to Soma."
3.58.19	"All the worlds, O Agni, are thy dominion; all the worlds, O thou of universal sight, are thy dominion. Thy rays extend to the end of thy light." Agni, indeed, is the lord of these worlds.
3.58.20	They thus generate him at the morning pressing.
3.58.21	They churn him at the midday pressing when he is generated.
3.58.22	"He indeed rules over this whole world, as it is said, "Thou art the Vyanashi (one who cleanses) Soma, the lord of the world, the king of the universe."
3.59.1	These are the Jagati verses with the form of Gāyatrī, having attained the form of the day.
3.59.2	Where they prosper without food, there they prosper.
3.59.3	He prospers who knows thus.
3.59.4	For this indeed, the Sandhi, he did not see an offering.
3.59.5	The Jagat is the first of the three days.
3.59.6	They begin this day with the Jagati.
3.59.7	They attain equality from equality.
3.59.8	He who knows the four-fold Stoma, the four yoked ones carry him.
3.59.9	The last day of the Jagat is the third day.
3.59.10	They enter the Jagati day.
3.59.11	Just as one would employ a yoke and a yoke-fellow for ploughing, so he employs the last three days for the next three days.
3.59.12	Those who know this carry him with the four (sacrifices) united.
3.59.13	He who has well-knit desires is well-knit, and he who is well-knit has well-knit (desires).
3.59.14	The Jagat is the first of the three days.
3.59.15	They begin the day with the Jagati.
3.59.16	They attain equality from equality.
3.59.17	The second day is of the Tristubh metre.
3.59.18	They enter the third day of three days with the Tristubh.
3.59.19	They pass from the equal to the equal, where the third day of the three days is.
3.59.20	They enter on the tenth day with the Gayatri.
3.59.21	They go from the equal to equal.
3.59.22	This indeed is the one who has the metres mixed.
3.59.23	Pavamāna has generated (the Soma). The Anurūpa is one who generates.
3.59.24	They generate the Sodashin from the morning pressing.
3.59.25	They begin the third pressing with that which has been generated.
3.59.26	They say, "They begin with the form of the day, with the Stotriya and with the Anurūpa Sāman." The Stotriya and Anurūpa are the two.
3.59.27	Prāṇa is the Stotriya, Apāna is the Anurūpa.
3.59.28	By means of Prāṇa and Apāna they prosper and go to the end.
3.60.1	"The bright light of heaven shines, the great Vaiśvānara." They attain the form of the great.
3.60.2	For this is the great day.
3.60.3	The Pavamāna is your juice, the juice is yours, O Pavamāna. Thus he recites the Vairāja form in unison.
3.60.4	For the Vairāja has a form that is recited in unison.
3.60.5	When the cows go forth, they bellow. Thus they approach the form of the Pravargya.
3.60.6	For this is the Pravargya day.
3.60.7	The swift ones, the tireless ones, have gone forth, killing the black skin. The black is sin, the skin.
3.60.8	They strike it down with this (verse).
3.60.9	"They cross the difficult bridge of Suvit, saying, 'We cross the difficult bridge.' The bridge of the three days was indeed difficult to cross; they cross it with this (verse)."
3.60.10	"The sound of the rain, of the strong Pavamana,
3.60.11	The lightning moves in the sky."
3.60.12	Thus they approach the form of the Brihat.
3.60.13	For this is the Brihat day.
3.60.14	Flow forth, O Indra, with the great wealth of cattle, with gold,
3.60.15	with horses, O Soma, with heroes.
3.60.16	Thus they become cattle-rich, animal-rich. For the securing of cattle.
3.60.17	Flow forth, O Indra. Thou art worshipped by all men. Thou fillest the great heaven and earth.
3.60.18	The dawn with the rays of the sun.
3.60.19	Thus they are sun-rich.
3.60.20	This is the twenty-first day of the Sun, the firm one, the Viraj.
3.60.21	May Soma protect us with his sustaining stream from all sides.
3.60.22	Like a bee to the honey-filled hive.
3.60.23	Thus the Parivati verses are sung. They are the form of the end.
3.60.24	For this is the last day.
3.60.25	Flow swiftly, O Soma, with great wisdom, with your beloved abode,
3.60.26	Where the gods are said to be.
3.60.27	Purifying the unpurified.
3.60.28	This is the one who is around heaven.
3.60.29	Thus it is said. The form of the end is the end.
3.60.30	The Anushtubh is the end of the metres.
3.60.31	This day is Anushtubh.
3.61.1	It consists of six verses, for there are six seasons, for the attainment of the seasons.
3.61.2	They say that the six-verse (hymn) is the form of the sixth day. But why is it performed on the fourth day?
3.61.3	He should say: The six seasons are the year, the year is Prajapati, the sacrifice.
3.61.4	Having obtained Prajapati, who is the year, and the sacrifice, they again begin at the beginning of the pressing.
3.61.5	For this sacrifice is indeed drawn as if it were drawn in the first three days.
3.61.6	It consists of six verses.
3.61.7	They begin the sacrifice with it, going forward.
3.61.8	They urge the sun, the two oxen. They urge the born one.
3.61.9	This day is born.
3.61.10	The sisters, the wives, the husband. These are indeed the sisters.
3.61.11	These are the same as the Jāmays.
3.61.12	"They are indeed the "great ones"."
3.61.13	They indeed make him flow.
3.61.14	"He flows with the beautiful light," they say. They approach the golden form of the sun."
3.61.15	This is the solar day, the twenty-first, the foundation of the Viraj.
3.61.16	O Pavamāna, come to the praise, the rain, for the gods.
3.61.17	O Indra, do thou flow forth with the Soma.
3.61.18	Thus is the praise. For the stability of offspring, for the presence of cattle.
3.61.19	The Stoma is of twenty-one (verses).
3.61.20	There are twelve months, five seasons, these three worlds, and the sun, making twenty-one.
3.61.21	The Jagati verses are praised as twelve.
3.61.22	The Gāyatrī verses are twenty-four.
3.61.23	They are eighteen Anushtubh verses.
3.61.24	This is the Anushtubh day.
3.62.1	"The verse, "The protector of the people was born, the watchful one," is for Agni. It is about the people."
3.62.2	He indeed is the protector of the people.
3.62.3	They generate him at the morning pressing.
3.62.4	They churn him at the midday pressing.
3.62.5	Agni is indeed the name of the fire.
3.62.6	"He says, "The well-skilled one for the new welfare." The breath is the skill.
3.62.7	They indeed place the breath in him.
3.62.8	" "He says, "Having the form of ghee." Ghee is indeed the beloved abode of Agni. With the beloved abode they indeed make him prosper.
3.62.9	" "They say, "The great one touching the heaven." They attain the form of the great one."
3.62.10	This is the Brhat-day.
3.62.11	"It shines brightly for the Bharatas, the pure one." These indeed are the Bharata-people; it shines brightly for them.
3.62.12	And because the Bharatas performed the sacrifice with it first, and because it carries oblations to the gods, therefore it is called Bharata.
3.62.13	"You, O Agni, the Angiras have found in the secret place." "You" means "you." It is the form of the great one.
3.62.14	This is the great day.
3.62.15	They found him wandering in the forest. They found him wandering in a forest.
3.62.16	When you are churned, you are born with great strength. At the morning pressing, they first churn him.
3.62.17-20	They generate him at the midday pressing. They call you the son of Sahas, O Angiras. Indeed, they generate him as Sahas-like. The banner of the sacrifice. Indeed, this is the banner of the sacrifice.
3.63.1	The first (verse) is, 'The Purohita (priest)'. Indeed, they place him in the front.
3.63.2	When they place the fire, they say, 'Men have placed Agni in the three-fold place.' Indeed, these beings are men.
3.63.3	They kindle him.
3.63.4	'With Indra and the gods, with the chariot, seated on the sacrificial grass, the Hotri, the well-wishing one, for the sacrifice', it becomes connected with all the gods.
3.63.5	For this day is dedicated to all the gods, and the Anushtubh metre is dedicated to all gods.
3.63.6	The Anushtubh is dedicated to all deities.
3.63.7	"The verse, "This is for you, O Mitra-Varuna," is for the Maitravaruna priest."
3.63.8	This is a repetition of the offering.
3.63.9	The sacrifice stands firm when this first three-day period is completed.
3.63.10	"What is your supreme sacrifice?" Thus they said to the gods.
3.63.11	Therefore one should perform the second oblation of clarified butter.
3.63.12	The two kings, the non-persecutors, are in the firm, highest seat.
3.63.13	They have a thousand pillars.
3.63.14	Thus they approach the Virajas with a thousand forms.
3.63.15	For this day is indeed connected with Viraj.
3.63.16	They are the queens, the drinkers of ghee. They become queens.
3.63.17	For now they have gone to the state of kingship.
3.63.18	"Indra with Dadhyach's bones." It becomes Indra-related.
3.64.1	Dadhyang Atharvaṇa was lustrous and had brahmic splendor.
3.64.2	Now, those Asuras who saw him from a distance, they all lay down with their heads towards him.
3.64.3	He indeed ascended to the heavenly world.
3.64.4	Indra, being pressed by the Asuras, said, "Where is that Dadhyan?
3.64.5	They said to him, "O revered one, he has indeed ascended to the heaven."
3.64.6	He said, "There is nothing left here."
3.64.7	They said to him, "This was indeed the horse-headed (ritual), which the Asvins taught to Devaveda. But we do not know where it was."
3.64.8	"One should search for it."
3.64.9	While searching,
3.64.10	one finds the head of the horse, which is hidden among the horses.
3.64.11-17	That he knows, in the Sarayati. Thus it is said. Sarayati is the name of a river in the Kurukshetra region. They knew this and gave it to him. He kept it in the light of the Asuras. Those Asuras who saw it from afar, they all lay down with their heads towards it.
3.65.1-7	He struck the Asuras with those very bones, nine times ninety. This is the victory over enemies. Indra, with Dadhici's bones, struck the Vritras, invincible. He struck them nine times ninety. Thus it is said. One who knows this conquers and destroys the enemy, the foe. Here it is said: The name of the cow was discovered by Tvashtri.
3.65.8	Thus in the house of the moon.
3.65.9	Thus they become cows and cattle, for the securing of cattle.
3.65.10	"This is your mind, this is your mind," it is Indra-Agni.
3.65.11	Indra-Agni, the ancient praise.
3.65.12	Like rain from a cloud.
3.65.13	Thus.
3.65.14	They say that "ajani" means "born."
3.65.15	It is by this day that one is born.
3.65.16	Listen to the call of the singer, O Indra and Agni, accept the songs.
3.65.17	Be the rulers, nourishing the thoughts.
3.65.18	Do not lead us to sin, O Indra and Agnis, do not to censure.
3.65.19	Do not let us fall into the abyss.
3.65.20	This is indeed a sacrifice against sin.
3.65.21	The Stoma becomes twenty-one.
3.65.22	The twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds, and this sun are twenty-one.
3.65.23	They go to the same world as this, they ascend this.
3.66.1	The verses of the Madhyandin Pavamana are Dakshasadhana, O Pavamana, you flow, the verses are Dakshasadan.
3.66.2	They make the days prosper by these (verses). They make the metres prosper. They make the deities prosper. They make (the verse) consisting of sixteen (syllables) prosper.
3.66.3	"For the gods to drink, for Hari, for the Maruts, for Vayu, for the Madhu." They become Marutvati (verses).
3.66.4	The form of midday is indeed Marutvat.
3.66.5	They do not go beyond the form of midday.
3.66.6	The verses are "The bull shines with the gods" and "The bull shines" (RV 10.102.1-2). They are in the Brihatī metre.
3.66.7	This is the Brhatī day.
3.66.8	The verses are "Pavamāna, impelled by wisdom, has come to the womb" (RV 9.1.1). They are in yonimati metre.
3.66.9	From the womb, offspring and cattle are born.
3.66.10	This is a form of the Janadva day of the Viraj week.
3.66.11	"He mounts the wind with Dharma. They become Vayu-related. Wind is peace. By peace alone he does not burn.
3.66.12	In them, the Gayatri is as described in the Brahmanas.
3.66.13	Then the Atharvan of four kinds is the form of the fourth day.
3.66.14	Atharvan went to the upper hawk, the heavenly world.
3.66.15	They did not stand there."
3.66.16	They desired to stand in the heavenly world.
3.66.17	They saw this Sama.
3.66.18	They praised with it.
3.66.19	Then indeed they stood in the heavenly world,
3.66.20	It has four endings for stability. They say that it stands on four feet.
3.66.21	This is the heavenly Sama of stability, well established.
3.66.22	He goes to the world of heaven, he stands in the world of heaven who knows thus.
3.66.23	That indeed is the remedy, the atonement.
3.66.24	They make it like a remedy for Bhava.
3.66.25	They make atonement with this remedy.
3.66.26	It becomes elevated.
3.66.27	From the elevated, offspring and cattle are born.
3.66.28	This is the form of the Vairāja day.
3.66.29	By this (day) the form is enriched.
3.66.30	What the Atharvaṇas saw, therefore it is called the Atharvanic wealth of four kinds.
3.67.1	Now the Vairāja of the concluding portion.
3.67.2	Thus indeed, the Vairāja is neither of its own accord, nor of the concluding portion, nor of the Iḍa, nor of the Nṛsaṃ.
3.67.3	That is the end of speech.
3.67.4	Speech is indeed Viraj. Viraj is the beginning.
3.67.5	They indeed begin with Viraj.
3.67.6	It is indeed the end of this one.
3.67.7	One should meditate on the end of this, having the desire for the desire one wishes for.
3.67.8	That desire indeed succeeds for him.
3.67.9	Because the desires of him who dies are fulfilled, therefore it is called the 'Vairaja' (of the gods).
3.67.10	The gods, desiring heaven, practised austerities.
3.67.11	They saw this Sama.
3.67.12	They praised with it.
3.67.13	Then they attained the heavenly world.
3.67.14	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.67.15	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.67.16	This is the end of it, that they churn out Agni in the Stotra of the Vairāja.
3.67.17	"Thou art mine, O Soma, in churning." It becomes "thine." It is the form of the Brhat.
3.67.18	This is the Brhat day.
3.67.19	"O Indra, friend, every day."
3.67.20	"Many, O Babhru, do not approach me. Go beyond the boundaries."
3.67.21	For he goes beyond.
3.67.22	I, for thee, at night and by day, milking the tawny-streaming Soma, am the one who knows. These indeed are the ones who know.
3.67.23	They indeed give him all his desires.
3.67.24	"The sun, shining with ghee, is beyond." They become those having the sun.
3.67.25	For this is the twenty-first day of the sun, the firm, the Viraj.
3.67.26	The birds fell down as if they were images.
3.67.27	In them, the eight-toothed (rite) is spoken of, as in the Prahâna (rite).
3.67.28	Above that, the form of the Brihat (rite) is performed on the Brihat day.
3.67.29	By that, the form is accomplished.
3.68.1	Now, the Abhiishava (rite) is the beginning of the sacrifice. The retreat is the fifth day. One begins with the Abhiishava and retreats to the third day.
3.68.2	The gods, by means of the twelve-day (rite), went to the heavenly world.
3.68.3	But he was not included in it. He hung down.
3.68.4	They saw these two Sāman chants.
3.68.5	Just as one would mount a chariot, having first fastened it with two straps, so they mounted the heavenly world, having first fastened themselves with these two.
3.68.6	They went to the heavenly world and said, "These two Sāmans are indeed not in the Yajna."
3.68.7	That is why they are called Abhiśavas.
3.68.8	These two are the heavenly Sāmans.
3.68.9	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.68.10	Therefore, both Sāmans should be performed.
3.68.11	Just as one would go with a single arrow, so it is when one goes with the other. Just as one would shoot with both arrows, so it is with both.
3.68.12	Therefore both should be done.
3.68.13	Here another would be in the ninth day, the other.
3.68.14	Shyavasva, the son of Abhihu, desired, "May the gods be satisfied with my Soma."
3.68.15	He saw these two Sāmans.
3.68.16	He praised with them.
3.68.17	Then the gods were satisfied with that Soma.
3.68.18	There is a contradiction between these two, as if one were to satisfy (the gods) in this way.
3.68.19	They satisfy (the gods), saying, "E-e-e!"
3.68.20	These are the verses of satisfaction.
3.68.21	The gods are satisfied with him who knows this.
3.68.22	Whatever Abhiśu and Śyāvāśva saw, from that they are called Abhiśava.
3.69.1	Then the form of the fourth day is the Angirasa of the four Vedas.
3.69.2	Then those four days are indeed arranged by that very (Angirasa).
3.69.3	The Angirasas, desiring cattle and heaven, practised austerity.
3.69.4	They saw this Sama.
3.69.5	They praised with it.
3.69.6	Having approached this middle Ida, they went up to heaven above.
3.69.7	Ida is indeed cattle, and heaven is the world of heaven.
3.69.8	Having resorted to cattle, they went to the world of heaven,
3.69.9	This is the cattle-yielding, heavenly Sama.
3.69.10	He who knows this obtains cattle and goes to the world of Svarga.
3.69.11-15	Because the Angirases saw this, therefore it is called the Angiras-sacrifice of four kinds. Then they become (the verses) "He who purifies, he who goes, he who has gone, he who will go, he who has come, he who comes, he who has arrived, he who will arrive, he who has crossed, he who crosses, he who will cross, he who has been crossed, he who is being crossed, he who will be crossed, he who has passed, he who passes, he who will pass, he who has surpassed, he who surpasses, he who will surpass, he who has exceeded, he who exceeds, he who will exceed, he who has transcended, he who transcends, he who will transcend, he who has overcome, he who overcomes, he who will overcome, he who has conquered, he who conquers, he who will conquer, he who has won, he who wins, he who will win, he who has reached, he who reaches, he who will reach, he who has attained, he who attains, he who will attain, he who has approached, he who approaches, he who will approach, he who has advanced, he who advances, he who will advance, he who has progressed, he who progresses, he who will progress, he who has moved, he who moves, he who will move, he who has stepped, he who steps, he who will step, he who has walked, he who walks, he who will walk, he who has traversed, he who traverses, he who will traverse, he who has surmounted, he who surmounts, he who will surmount, he who has risen, he who rises, he
3.69.16	The fourth day is the world of the sun.
3.69.17	They indeed pass beyond it.
3.69.18	"They become (cows) with the (words) "Aruna rises from the womb," because they are with the womb."
3.69.19	From the womb are born the offspring and cattle.
3.69.20	The form of this day of Vairaja is that of the people.
3.69.21	"The (words) ". Indra, the bull, has come to the Soma," they become (cows) having bulls, the form of the great one."
3.69.22	This is the Barhaspatya day.
3.69.23	"The verse, "Indra, may he bestow on us great wealth, from every side," has verses with the word "all."
3.69.24	This is because this is the Vaishvadeva day.
3.69.25	" The verse, "Flow forth, O Soma, with a thousand," approaches the thousand-formed Viraj.
3.69.26	This is because it is the Viraj day.
3.69.27	They say, "Those who make the last (verse) in the Gāyatrī verses, they go to the Pavamāna verses of the Tristubh."
3.69.28	They become endowed with testicles.
3.69.29	The Tristubh has the form of being endowed with testicles,
3.69.30	Therefore they do not go to the Pavamanas of the Tristubha.
3.69.31	In those (verses), the Sātrāsāhiya is explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.69.32	It is the Utkha-sāman. The Utkhas are cattle; (it is) for the securing of cattle.
3.69.33	They say, "The Utkha-Sāman is performed at the Pavamāna (Stotra). Why is that?"
3.69.34	The first day is the share of the morning pressing, the second day is the share for the midday pressing, and the third day is the share at the third pressing.
3.69.35	Now this is the share of Utkha.
3.69.36	Whatever is done here for the purpose of overcoming fear, thereby they exclude it from the praises.
3.69.37	They enrich it with its own abode.
3.69.38	With that which is enriched, one becomes a recipient in one's own community.
3.69.39	And the praises are animals, and the midday is the self.
3.69.40	Now, when they bring the midday meal to the frightened cow, they establish the cattle in themselves.
3.70.1	This is the Vairāja (hymn), which is indeed procreation.
3.70.2	When one begins with the two (verses) in the form of a couple, it is for the sake of procreation of the couple.
3.70.3	The first three are from the Stobha, the last three from the Praja.
3.70.4	They are indeed covered by that.
3.70.5	He recites the three steps.
3.70.6	Two are born from the pair.
3.70.7	What is born from the pair is the third.
3.70.8	He recits three times.
3.70.9	From the repeated (recitation) are born offspring and cattle.
3.70.10	He who knows this is born with offspring and cattle.
3.70.11	He establishes it ten times, and then he pours it back into the unestablished.
3.70.12	The nine are the northern pillars, the tenth is the final one. The Viraj has ten syllables, the Viraj is food, for the attainment of food.
3.70.13	They churn Agni.
3.70.14	Agni is the Viraj.
3.70.15	They thus produce food for Viraj.
3.70.16	They churn with the sound "Hi!" after having placed it in the prescribed place.
3.70.17	For from the sound "Hi" semen is deposited.
3.70.18	And thus they produce food for Viraji in the middle of the Sama.
3.70.19	They churn on the thigh of the Udgâtri, the Prastôtâ and Pratihâri chant from the side of Viraj to prevent interruption.
3.70.20	They churn on the right thigh.
3.70.21	Therefore this half of the man is more vigorous.
3.70.22	They churn on the bones for peace.
3.70.23	They churn in the Avaka plants for non-burning.
3.70.24	They carry the Agnihotra-priest who is born.
3.70.25	From here the fires are spread.
3.70.26	They say that the one who carries the fire is the Yajamana, and the fire is the offspring.
3.70.27	They thus make the Yajamāna prosper with offspring.
3.71.1	They say that one who carries the Agni takes away food from him.
3.71.2	One should recite this verse over him:
3.71.3	May he return with energy, may Agni return with life and food.
3.71.4	Again, protect us from harm.
3.71.5	Come back with wealth, O Agni, swell with the stream,
3.71.6	All-knowing, all around.
3.71.7	Thus he again puts food in himself.
3.71.8	With what he praises, they conclude with that.
3.71.9	Therefore that sun moves both hither and thither.
3.71.10	From where the sun rises today, from there it will rise tomorrow.
3.71.11	Then the Vamadevya.
3.71.12	The Vamadevya is the cattle.
3.71.13	Those who praise with it become cattle-owners.
3.71.14	All the armies, the conquerors, the men, the companions, have created Indra, the king, and have generated him. The verses are about the people. The verses are of the people.
3.71.15	This is the form of the Vaishvadevah day.
3.72.1	Among them, the Tri-shoka.
3.72.2-6	The sacrifice of the Vairājas is indeed very much diminished. They restore it with the Triṣṭubh metre, which is inferior. These worlds, being united, increase in three ways. They grieve as one would grieve if cut off in three ways. The gods said, "We shall remove the three sorrows of these three worlds."
3.72.7	They saw this Sama.
3.72.8	They praised with it.
3.72.9	With it they removed the three sorrows of these three worlds.
3.72.10	That they removed the three sorroes of these three worlds, that is the threefold sorrowfulness, the threefold sorrowfulness.
3.72.11	He who knows this, removes sorrow.
3.72.12	They placed it in the impotent, the gambler, and the unchaste.
3.72.13	Therefore, they are pierced by grief and grieve.
3.72.14	Those who know this are not born with grief.
3.72.15	Therefore, one should not speak to them, lest one should be separated from grief.
3.72.16	Kanva, the son of Narsha, obtained the daughter of the Asura Akha.
3.72.17	From her were born his two sons, Trishukanbha and Kau.
3.72.18	She, being angry, went to her relatives.
3.72.19	They followed her.
3.72.20	They, the Asuras, smeared him with a paste and said, "Recognize this as your wife, if you are a brahmin."
3.72.21	The Ashvins understood that.
3.72.22	The Ashvins indeed are the liberators of the gods.
3.72.23	They approached him when he was not visible and said, "When you both played the lute and fell down more and more, then you would have known the dawn."
3.72.24	They said, "We were flying all night. Get up, yoke the ploughs."
3.72.25	"There is no dawn," he said.
3.72.26	Then the two of them struck the lute, and they went up higher and higher.
3.72.27	He said, "Take this away now. The sky is overcast. Plough the fields."
3.73.1	They said, "This was a brahmin sage.
3.73.2	His wife was Dhurāparahā.
3.73.3	Let us give him this."
3.73.4	They gave her to him. She said, "They are again trying to kill you, but indirectly."
3.73.5	"You should sit on her."
3.73.6	They went.
3.73.7	They placed a golden couch in the shade for him.
3.73.8	He sat down carelessly on it.
3.73.9	She became a stone and crushed him.
3.73.10	Now the two sons of Trishoknabha, having heard, said, "The Asuras have struck our father with a stone."
3.73.11	They came.
3.73.12	Nabhaka desired, "I shall frighten them."
3.73.13	He saw this hymn to Nabhaka.
3.73.14	With it he struck her.
3.73.15	She was seen in it.
3.74.1	Just as a string of pearls is seen in a pearl, so is it.
3.74.2	Then Trishoka thought, "I should possess her."
3.74.3	He saw this Sama (chant).
3.74.4	With that he divided her into two.
3.74.5	Her end turned back to him.
3.74.6	He desired, "May she live."
3.74.7	He recited, "May she be alive."
3.74.8	She came to life.
3.74.9	It was as if it were darkness to him.
3.74.10	He desired, "May it be like heaven to him."
3.74.11	He touched him, saying, "O heaven!"
3.74.12	It was as if it was heaven to him.
3.74.13	"May he go to heaven alone."
3.74.14	He sent him to heaven, saying, "Heaven!"
3.74.15	If it were like a thread, he should conclude with "O Yis, to life."
3.74.16	If it were like a tamara tree, he should conclude "O Yis to heaven."
3.74.17	If one desires prosperity, he should conclude only with "O Yīs to heaven."
3.74.18	These are the concluding verses of this hymn, these are the desires.
3.74.19	He obtains these desires.
3.74.20	Whatever desire one may have, if one praises with this Sama, that desire is fulfilled. Because Trishoka saw it, it is known as Trishoka.
3.75.1	"He who is the king of the people" - as if he went to the kingdom.
3.75.2	"He went in chariots, O Adhrigu."
3.75.3	"He who destroys all enemies, the best, the slayer of Vritra, I praise."
3.75.4	Thus they go as if to the elder brother.
3.75.5	O Indra, the destroyer of cities, we approach you, whose two laws are in the creator.
3.75.6	The thunderbolt was hurled by the hand, the great god, the shining sun.
3.75.7	Thus they become connected with the sun.
3.75.8	For this is the twenty-first day connected with the sun,
3.75.9	the Viraj of stability.
3.75.10	In them, the Prsni.
3.75.11	Speech is Pṛśni.
3.75.12	They attain speech with this day.
3.75.13	They indeed know that very thing.
3.75.14	That is why they call it Pṛśni of Bharadvāja.
3.75.15	Bharadvāja desired, 'May I beget many offspring and cattle.'
3.75.16	He saw this Sama.
3.75.17	He praised with it.
3.75.18	Then he indeed begot many offspring and cattle.
3.75.19	He said, "Pṛṣni is indeed abundant with offspring and cattle."
3.75.20	That is the reason for Pṛṣni's abundance.
3.75.21	This is the generative Sāman.
3.75.22	One who knows this becomes abundant with offspring and animals.
3.75.23	And indeed, it is with this very Sāman that Bharadvāja Pṛṣṇi obtained food.
3.75.24	That is the attainment of food.
3.75.25	He who knows this obtains food and becomes the best among his kinsmen.
3.75.26	Because Bharadvaja saw it, it is called Bharadvaja's verse.
3.75.27	It becomes the Iḍa hymn of the Acchāvāka.
3.75.28	The Iḍa is indeed cattle.
3.75.29	They indeed establish themselves in cattle.
3.76.1	The Pavamāna hymn of the Ārbhava Sāman has the Gāyatrī verses in groups of four.
3.76.2	The Anushtubh is the last of the metres.
3.76.3	This day is Anushtubh.
3.76.4	"The verse, "Pra praksayaipadnya", is in the form of the Prayaṇīya (hymn). They approach the Prayaṇiya hymn."
3.76.5	This is the Prayaṇi day.
3.76.6	He, the son, was born pure from the pure mother. When born, he shone forth. They are full of people.
3.76.7	They thus generate the Sodashin from the third pressing.
3.76.8	In them, the Gayatra is as described in the Brahmana.
3.76.9	Now the Urnayuva.
3.76.10	Urnayu, the Gandharva, desired the Apsarases.
3.76.11	He saw this Sama.
3.76.12	He praised with it.
3.76.13	Whatever he desired, he obtained. Whatever he touched, he obtained, he won.
3.76.14	This is the Sama Veda of desire.
3.76.15	He desired this very desire.
3.76.16	This desire was fulfilled for him.
3.76.17	Whatever desire one may have, if one praises with this Sama Veda, that desire is fulfilled.
3.76.18	The Gandharva Urnayu saw it, and from that it is called Urnayuva.
3.77.1	The Angirasas, desiring heaven, performed a sacrifice.
3.77.2	They did not know the heavenly world.
3.77.3	The Angirasi Shvitra, the doorkeeper of the sacrificial fire, went forth.
3.77.4	Then the Gandharva Urnayu recited this hymn above the Sama. He said, "This Sama is indeed heavenly. Sing with it. Having sung with it, you will attain the heavenly world."
3.77.5	"But tell me the Sama."
3.77.6	"If someone asks you, 'Who told you this?' then say, 'Urnayu told me.'"
3.77.7	"He said, 'I alone know it, not you.'
3.77.8	" He returned and said, 'This is the Sama Veda, which is heavenly.
3.77.9	" Let us praise with it."
3.77.10	" Having praised with it, we will attain heaven."
3.77.11	" They said, 'Who told you this?'"
3.77.12	" He said, 'I saw it myself.'
3.77.13	" They praised with it.
3.77.14	" Having praised, they attained heaven.
3.77.15	Those who went to the heavenly world, he became less.
3.77.16	He spoke untruth, and became white.
3.77.17	These are indeed snakes, which are white.
3.77.18	What he became less, that is the non-existence of snakes.
3.77.19	Then indeed, in the case of snakes,
3.77.20	Therefore, one should say to him from whom one would speak, "I spoke to him."
3.77.21-26	Then indeed he would dispute about the truth. This is the heavenly Sama. He who knows this attains the heavenly world. "You are indeed divine," "you" means the form of Brihat. This is a day of Brihat. Pavamana, the most brilliant generations, the verses are about generations.
3.77.27	They thus make the Sodashin (Stoma) grow from the third pressing.
3.78.1	Among them one of the Brihat stomas.
3.78.2	For this day is indeed performed with the Brihat stoma.
3.78.3	The gods, desiring heaven, practised austerities.
3.78.4	They saw this Sama.
3.78.5	They praised with it.
3.78.6	It brought them to heaven, having become great.
3.78.7	Having gone to the heavenly world, they said, "Indeed, this is great, by whom we have gone to the heavenly realm."
3.78.8	That itself is the greatness of Brihatka.
3.78.9	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.78.10	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.78.11	Soma, purifying with waves, flows through the water,
3.78.12	At the beginning, Pavamana roars.
3.78.13	Thus it is like the beginning.
3.78.14	For this day is indeed the beginning, namely the Bharata.
3.78.15	They anoint the strong one with wisdom. Anointing is like birth.
3.78.16	One is born through this day.
3.78.17	The strong one, the son of Meedha, has released the pot, the winner of prizes.
3.78.18	Purifying, generating speech, he shone forth.
3.78.19	Thus they are called 'the ones with the people'.
3.78.20	They generate the Sodashin from the third pressing.
3.78.21	From pressing to pressing they generate the Sodashina.
3.79.1	In them is the Ati-shada.
3.79.2	Prajapati created the creatures.
3.79.3	Those created by him became dark.
3.79.4	He desired, "May not these creatures of mine be distressed."
3.79.5	He saw this Sama.
3.79.6	He approached them with it.
3.79.7	They became equal.
3.79.8	They are indeed measured in the fourth day, for they go to the Anushtubh.
3.79.9	The Anushtubh is indeed the supreme.
3.79.10	One indeed attains the supreme by this.
3.79.11	Therefore, one should conclude the hymn with the words "O Atman, O Atman".
3.79.12	They say, one should conclude without the words "O atman, O atman".
3.79.13	When one becomes unconscious, then one dies.
3.79.14	Therefore, one should conclude (the hymn) without the words "o atman, o atman".
3.79.15	The gods, desiring heaven, practised austerities.
3.79.16	They saw this Sama.
3.79.17-21	Therefore they praised him. He, having become the Sād, carried them to the heavenly world. They said, "It is indeed the Sād." Because they said, "It indeed is the Sād," that is the meaning of "the one who goes to the Sād" and "the one who belongs to the Sād." They went to the heavenly world and said, "It seems as if the heavenly world is indeed the Sādam."
3.79.22	That is the reason why it is called Atiṣṭāda.
3.79.23	This is the heavenly Sāman.
3.79.24	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.79.25	These are the verses: "Purorjitī vo andhasa" (RV. 10.189.1), on the Viraj day, in the Viraj metre, for the attainment of food.
3.79.26	Now, just as one would worship two new wheels, so they remove this Anushtubh verse in the three-day-long rites for the attainment of the world of heaven.
3.80.1	In them, there is the Nanada.
3.80.2	Indra killed Vritra with the Nanada. He did not kill him while he was sounding.
3.80.3	Because he killed him while he was not sounding, that is why it is called Nanada.
3.80.4	He who knows this slays his enemy without striking him.
3.80.5	He praises with sixteen syllables.
3.80.6	They begin with the sixteen-syllabled (verse) in a direct manner.
3.80.7	Gaupalaya of Upodita said to Visala of Libudja:
3.80.8	He praised the Anushtubh metre with the Gaurīvita, the Sodashin with the Anushtubha, and the Anushtubhas with the Anushtup. He did not fall away from prosperity.
3.80.9	He who knows this does not fall away from prosperit.
3.80.10	It is indeed provided with offspring even as the morning milk.
3.80.11	The Anhigava is a Vairāja Sāman. It is performed in the Vairāja tone. It is indeed Vairāja. For the attainment of food.
3.80.12	They apply this ten-syllabled Viraj to the middle. Viraj is ten-syllable, Viraj is food.
3.80.13	Soma flows, the generator of thoughts, the generator of heaven, the generator of earth.
3.80.14	The generator of Agni, the generator of the sun, the generator of Indra, the generator of Vishnu.
3.80.15	Thus it is said, "the generator, the generator."
3.80.16	They thus generate the Sodashin from the third pressing.
3.80.17	Just as one says, "Strike! Strike! Be born! Be born!" so they generate the Sodashina from the third pressing in this way.
3.81.1	Among them, the Vatsapra.
3.81.2	The people of Prati-satra attacked Bhālandana, who was fond of calves. Then they said, "He is your father."
3.81.3	He desired, 'May they invoke me with faith.'
3.81.4	He saw this Sama.
3.81.5	He praised with it.
3.81.6	Then he found the invocation of faith.
3.81.7	They perform the Sattra, saying, 'May we find faith.'
3.81.8	They indeed find faith.
3.81.9	This Sama is indeed suitable for Vaírája.
3.81.10	Just as the verses of the Vairāja are arranged in a regular order, so also the verses of the Vatsipra are arranged in a similar order.
3.81.11	This is indeed the progeny of the Vairājas.
3.81.12	One who knows this is born in accordance with his progeny.
3.81.13	They indeed offered him that oblation, saying, "Let him be born in accordance with the progeny of the Vairas."
3.81.14	It becomes elevated.
3.81.15	From the Anu-tundra (hymn) are born offspring and cattle.
3.81.16	The Anu-tundra is the form of this Vairāja hymn.
3.81.17	By it one attains prosperity.
3.81.18	Because Vatsapri Bhālandana saw it, therefore it is called Vatsapra.
3.81.19	Now the Yajñāyajñiya hymn, whose Brāhmaṇa has been spoken.
3.81.20	"You Agni, the growing one," for the day of the Bharata is indeed the growing one.
3.82.1	Among them, the one called Saindhukṣita.
3.82.2	Saindhukṣit saw the end of speech.
3.82.3	They attain speech with this day, and they attain it.
3.82.4	King Bharata of Sindhukshit, while wandering in the forest, was caught by his enemies. He desired, "May I go to my own abode."
3.82.5	He wandered only along the Sindhu river.
3.82.6	His territory was Sindhukshit.
3.82.7	He saw this Sama.
3.82.8	He praised it with that.
3.82.9	Then he went to his own abode.
3.82.10	This Sama is indeed conducive to desire.
3.82.11	He desired this desire.
3.82.12-17	That desire is accomplished for him. Whatever desire one may have, if one praises with this Sama, that desire is accomplished for one. That is indeed prosperity and sovereignty. He indeed attained sovereignty. One who knows this attains prosperity and sovereignty. The king of Sindhukshit Bharat saw (this). Therefore it is known as Saindhukṣita.
3.82.18	We have come to you, O most excellent one, for your body has become like the most excellent one.
3.82.19	Among them, the Saura Bharata is the great Brihat's splendor.
3.82.20	The sacrifice of the Vairājas has been greatly spread out.
3.82.21	They raise it up with the Saura Bharateya and the great Brihat.
3.82.22	That is the Ukarani Dhanam.
3.82.23	This is the actual form of the Brihatī, namely the U-sound and the I-sound.
3.82.24	By that (verse) one attains prosperity.
3.82.25	"O Indra, drink this Soma, the best, the immortal, the intoxicating." Thus it is as if they have attained supremacy.
3.82.26	And in the third pressing they place the taste, the intoxication.
3.83.1	Among them, the Vasiṣṭha.
3.83.2	Vasishtha desired, "May I see Viraj and obtain her."
3.83.3	While reciting, he saw this Viraj of ten syllables.
3.83.4	He approached her and obtained her.
3.83.5	This is the obtaining of Viraj, the food, the Sama.
3.83.6	One who knows this obtains Viraj, the Food, and becomes the best among his kinsmen.
3.83.7	Because Vasishtha saw it, it is called Vasishtha.
3.83.8	They also call it Vasishtha's favorite.
3.83.9	Vasishtha, whose son was killed, desired, "May I beget many offspring and cattle."
3.83.10	He saw this Sama.
3.83.11	He praised with it.
3.83.12	Then he begot many offspring and cattle.
3.83.13	He said, "What I love is indeed dear to me, by which I have obtained a dear progeny."
3.83.14	That is the very reason why it is called "dear."
3.83.15	This is the generative Sama.
3.83.16	One who knows this becomes manyfold in progeny and cattle.
3.83.17	Vasishtha saw it, hence it is called Vasishtha's dear.
3.83.18	This is the Ida, the Sama of the Acchhavasas.
3.83.19	The Iḍā is indeed the animals.
3.83.20	They indeed establish themselves in the animals.
3.83.21	Then the Sodashin.
3.83.22	The first day is the morning pressing, the second day is the midday pressing, and the third day is the third pressing.
3.83.23	Then this is the Ukthabajana.
3.83.24	This is indeed one of the Ukthas, namely the Sodashin.
3.83.25	Whatever is done here in the sixteenth (day), by that they prosper him in his own abode.
3.83.26	By that prosperity he prospers in his own people.
3.84.1	"O cow-knower, O wealth-knower, knower of gold," is the form of the Simas.
3.84.2	"O doer, O doer of the Triṣṭubh form."
3.84.3	Therefore these are done on the Triṣṭhubh days.
3.84.4	"The semen-holder, O Indra, is deposited in the worlds." Thus they offer the bull at the morning pressing in the Mahanaamni verses for the purpose of reproduction.
3.84.5	"Thou art the most excellent hero, O Soma, knowing all." This is the form of the Simanas.
3.84.6	"Thee, O sage, we approach with songs." The Brahmanas are indeed the sages. They approach him with songs.
3.84.7	"Thou art the eye of men, O Soma, on all sides." The form of the boundaries is "on all sides."
3.84.8	"O Pavamana, thou runnest like a bull," they let loose the bull at the morning pressing in the Mahanama (verses) for propagation.
3.84.9	"Do thou, O Pavamana, flow for us with wealth, with gold." Wealth means cattle, gold.
3.84.10	Some say that gold means cattle.
3.84.11	The animals are the Cakvaris.
3.84.12	"He prays with the verse, "May we be in the worlds, O Jivas.", thus he prays for blessings.
3.84.13	"He is the lord of these worlds, O Vii.", the word "vii". is the form of the Siimas.
3.84.14	"The yoke-joined Indra, the green Suparnas.", the green Suparna is the Sakvari.
3.84.15	They are yoked at the morning pressing.
3.84.16	They are yoked at the midday pressing.
3.84.17	"They flow for you, sweet and full of ghee." Cattle are sweet, milk, curd, and ghee. They flow for cattle. The Sakvaris are cattle.
3.84.18	"Let the farmers stand in your vow, O Soma." This whole world stands in the vow of Soma.
3.85.1	These are the Jagati verses, having the form of the Tristubh, and are prosperous.
3.85.2	Where they prosper by the form of the day, there they are prosperous.
3.85.3	He prospers who knows thus.
3.85.4	The Anurūpa verse is "Pavamana, the knower of all."
3.85.5	"Knower of all" is the form of the Simanas.
3.85.6	They say, "They begin with the form of the Sāman, with the Stotriya and Anurūpa."
3.85.7	The Stotriya and the Anurūpa are performed.
3.85.8	The Stotriyā is the Prāṇa, the Anurūpā is the Apāna.
3.85.9	By means of Prāṇa and Apāna, they prosper and reach the end.
3.85.10	Your rays have flowed forth like the rays of the sun. The animals are indeed released like the rays of a sun.
3.85.11	Animals are the Sakvaris.
3.85.12	Making the sign, you flow around the heaven, for all good things. The word 'abhi' is the form of Rathantara.
3.85.13	This is the Rathantara day.
3.85.14	The ocean is Soma, the swelling one. The waters are indeed connected with the ocean on this day.
3.85.15	Thou art the knower, thou seekest speech. The day before indeed is born.
3.85.16	He is indeed the knower, and by this he seeks it. Therefore it is said, "Thou art the knowers, thou seekest the speech."
3.85.17	O Pavamana, in the law.
3.85.18	The god, the sun, cries.
3.85.19	Thus they approach the solar form of the Mahanama hymns.
3.85.20	The great names are indeed solar.
3.86.1	The Soma-pressers have sought the Soma, the purifying ones, the drops.
3.86.2	They delight in the waters.
3.86.3	The cows have sought the waters, the waters flowing along the channels.
3.86.4	Purifying, they approach Indra.
3.86.5	Thus it is said, "the waters, the waters." Indeed, this is the day of the waters.
3.86.6	O Pavamana, you flow for Indra, the intoxicating Soma.
3.86.7-11	For you are led by men. Thus it is seven verses. Seven are the vital airs. They go prospering with the vital airs, standing in the vital airs. They say, "Why is it done on the fifth day, when it is the form of the seventh day?"
3.86.12	He would say, "The Sakvaris have seven steps, there are seven domestic animals, seven and four extra metres, seven principal breaths, twenty-seven heavenly stars, this is the twenty-seventh day, for the attainment of all this and for the attainment of this."
3.86.13	The last seven verses are recited.
3.86.14	They proceed, as it were, with the Prāṇas, towards the east.
3.86.15	It is a Catuṣṭoma (Stoma), because animals have four feet.
3.86.16	This day is for animals; for the securing of animals.
3.86.17	There is a Parāsa (Sāman) for the stability of offspring and for the presence of animals.
3.86.18	The stoma is Trinava.
3.86.19	These worlds are Trinava.
3.86.20	They go to these very worlds, having attained them.
3.87.1	"Bhūr" is the Vyāhṛti.
3.87.2	This world is the deity, Agni, the Gāyatrī metre, the Trivṛt stoma, the Rāthantara Sāman, the Vasus are the deities, the trees and the herbs.
3.87.3	"Bhuvah" is the Vyāhrti.
3.87.4	This is the sky, Vayu is the deity, the Jagati metre, the Saptadasa stoma, the Vamadevya Saman, Rudra is the deity, water and Pranabhrat.
3.87.5	The Vyahrti is 'Svar'.
3.87.6	This is the world, the sun is the deity, Trishtup metre, the Pancadasa stoma, Bṛhat Saman, Aditya is the deity, Moon and stars.
3.87.7	These worlds become three-fold.
3.87.8	They say that the four days are pairs and the fifth day is not a pair.
3.87.9	Indeed, the pair is the reproduction up to the fourth.
3.87.10	That is why it is said, "Your wealth is like the lightning in the sky." The clarified butter offering is dedicated to Agni.
3.87.11	By that alone, the fifth day is made a pair.
3.87.12	"Oṃ, to you, O man, is the form; to you, O woman, is the glory."
3.87.13	"Oṃ, to the man is the rain; to the woman is the lightning."
3.87.14	"O Agni, to the man; to the woman, as it were, the dawns."
3.87.15	"O woman, to the plants; to the man, as it were the union."
3.87.16	They thus establish the union and procreation in the proper order for the propagation of the sacrificer.
3.88.1	The wind, impelled by him, has gone to the ocean, as he desired.
3.88.2	Thy chariots, O Agni, are stretched out, as they were separate, when thou, the imperishable, burnest.
3.88.3	Thus.
3.88.4	When the wind blows Agni, then he shines greatly.
3.88.5	This is the form of brilliance, which is the form of Brahman-splendour.
3.88.6	The one who makes the sacrifice shine, the one who makes the ritual shine, Agni, the Hotar, the one who is most powerful, the one who has the most wisdom.
3.88.7	You are the one who is equal to the offering of the young, you are the one who the great ones choose, not anyone else but you.
3.88.8	Thus, whatever offering is made by the young and whatever offering is made in abundance, Agni is chosen for the role of the Hotar.
3.88.9	Even though Purūravas is far away, O Varuna,
3.88.10	O Mitra and Varuna, may we have good counsel.
3.88.11	Thus it is Mitra-Varuna. It is for the purpose of averting evil.
3.88.12	Whatever is ill-sung, ill-praised, ill-done in the sacrifice, it is for the purpose averting that.
3.88.13	We have come to you, O Mitra and Varun, without injury, to your abode.
3.88.14	May we be your friends.
3.88.15	May Mitra and Varuna protect us with their protecting power.
3.88.16	May we conquer the Dasyus with our bodies.
3.88.17	He thus prays for a blessing.
3.89.1	" "Rising with strength," it is Indra-like."
3.89.2	The Stoma is indeed Tri-nava (nine-three).
3.89.3	They thus directly repeat it.
3.89.4	"The two worlds have followed thee." These indeed are the two worlds.
3.89.5	He thus addresses them.
3.89.6	"They have given to one who is contending." They indeed gave to him who was contending.
3.89.7	"O Indra, when thou didst become the slayer of Dasyus." The word "slayer" is used in the sense of killing.
3.89.8	This indeed is the praise of the sacrificer, that of the Brahman.
3.89.9	All the sins of the sacrificer are destroyed in that very place.
3.89.10	The speech of eight feet, nine-streamed, increasing with truth,
3.89.11	From Indra, my body.
3.89.12	Thus, speech is indeed Gāyatrī with eight feet.
3.89.13	Its Stoma is indeed Trivṛt, and the streaks are nine.
3.89.14	This is the divine supreme pair, the begetting, that is the Trivṛt stoma and the Gāyatrī metre.
3.89.15	They make it the divine supreme pair of begetting for the sacrificer's progeny.
3.90.1	They say that it should be done at the beginning of the Trivṛta.
3.90.2	The semen is indeed sprinkled from the mouth, and from here it is born.
3.90.3	That is the semen which is sprinkled from here.
3.90.4	Food is indeed the source of semen.
3.90.5	They say that it should be done above, for this is the generation, from here offspring are born, from where offspring are born, there is the great offspring.
3.90.6	Therefore it should be done only above.
3.90.7	"Indra and Agni, you two, these" - it is Indra-Agni.
3.90.8-13	"The Stotras are sung in chorus" - thus he praises many Stotras. Some days have one Stotra, others have many. This is the Trishtóma. Therefore he says, "The Stotras have been sung in chorus" and praises many Stotras.
3.90.14	Indra and Agni have come with them.
3.90.15	Come with them, O men, to this Soma-pressed libation.
3.90.16	O Indra and Agni, for drinking Soma.
3.90.17	Thus the hymns are for one deity each, but this one is for two deities.
3.90.18	It is like that so that one may stand firm on both sides.
3.90.19	The Stoma is of thirty-nine (verses).
3.90.20	These worlds are of thirty-nine.
3.90.21	They go to the worlds, established in these very worlds.
3.91.1	"O Soma, the most brilliant one," - the verses of the Madhyandin Pavamana are in the Gayatra metre.
3.91.2	"Arsa" is the form of Rathantara.
3.91.3	This day is Rathantara.
3.91.4	"Roar like the Dronas," - the word "abhi" is the form for Rathantara.
3.91.5-10	The verses are addressed to Indra and Vayu, so they are connected with water. For this day is indeed connected with water. (The verses) are addressed to Varuna and the Maruts, so they are related to the Maruts. For the form of midday is indeed related to the Marut. They do not go beyond the form of midday. "They are addressed to Soma, saying, "Grant us food for our offspring, O Soma, from all sides." They are connected with all sides.
3.91.11	This is the Visvadevah day.
3.91.12	"They approach the Mahanama hymns with the verse, "Flow on, O Indra, with a thousand streams."
3.91.13	For the Mahanama hymns are cattle."
3.91.14	The Gayatra hymn among them has been explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.91.15	Now about the Yanasantani.
3.91.16	From the fifth day the gods created the sixth day.
3.91.17	The fifth day is like a hole.
3.91.18	The Madhyandina reciters chant the Pavamana verses beginning with "Yad yanasantani" (RV 10.10.1) in order to attain the day and to make it whole.
3.91.19	He who knows this stands firm.
3.91.20	Prajapati created the animals.
3.91.21	They, having been created, went away from him.
3.91.22	He desired, "May I bring the animals back to myself."
3.91.23	He saw this Samaveda.
3.91.24	He bound himself and the animals.
3.91.25	That he bound himself and the beasts, that is the reason for the name Yajña.
3.91.26	The Udgātṛ is indeed Prajāpati.
3.91.27	He binds himself and the animals with the Yajña. This is the truth.
3.91.28	The fifth day is the equinox of the twelve-day sacrifice.
3.91.29	The Yajñasantani is in front, the Santani is above.
3.92.7-13	He recites it thrice, responds once, and concludes thrice. They thus make it seven. The Sakvaris have seven steps. The animals are Sakvaris. He thus supports them from behind. The animals belong to the Sakvaris. The Yajus is in front, the Santanis above. It is for the sake of the animals being enclosed.
3.92.14	Just as one would bind a herd of cattle with a rope or a stick, so does he bind the cattle for protection against loss.
3.92.15	He whose cattle are thus bound does not lose his wealth.
3.92.16	The Sakvaris are indeed the waters.
3.92.17	The Yajus is placed in front, the Sannati is placed above. It is for the sake of binding the waters.
3.92.18	Therefore, the waters that are held back flow.
3.92.19	Indeed, these are the banks of the waters.
3.92.20	If these were not there, this entire world would be destroyed, just as the waters would be destroyed by the wind. This is done to prevent destruction.
3.92.21	Having approached the Ida of this Yajus-verse, they approach the Ida in the middle. The form of the Sakvaris is directly seen. It is performed on the Shakalah day.
3.92.22	By that, the form is enriched.
3.93.1	Then the Shakalah.
3.93.2	Shakala saw the fifth day as having the form of Rathantara.
3.93.3	Therefore, it is performed on the Rathantara day.
3.93.4	Shakala, desiring food, performed austerities.
3.93.5	He saw this Sama.
3.93.6	He praised with it.
3.93.7	Then he obtained food.
3.93.8	There is a similarity between this and that, just as one would give.
3.93.9	It becomes like a hum.
3.93.10	Food is a hum.
3.93.11	Hum is what is given as food.
3.93.12	This is the non-decline of food. This is the Sama.
3.93.13	He who knows this becomes the best among his kinsmen, the one who has food.
3.93.14	And whatever is done here before the Sakvaris, as if cruel, that is pacified by this cry.
3.93.15	Whatever he saw, from that and that it is called Śākalya.
3.94.1	Now about Vārṣa.
3.94.2	Vṛṣa was the priest of the king of the Ikṣvāku dynasty, Triyaruṇa, Trivṛṣṇa.
3.94.3	And then indeed, before the kings, the priests used to take the chariots, thinking, "Let this one not do evil."
3.94.4	They were chasing a young brahmin who was playing on the road and they cut him with the wheel of their chariot.
3.94.5	The other one was chasing him and was about to catch him, but the other one was running away.
3.94.6	When he caught up with him, he was unable to escape.
3.94.7	They cut him with the same wheel.
3.94.8	When he was dying, they said to him, "You are the killer! You are the killer!"
3.95.2	They asked the question of the Haikshvākas.
3.95.3	The Haikshvāka said, "He who controls the chariot is the lord of the chariot."
3.95.4	"You are the killer," they said to him.
3.95.5	He desired, "May I go from here and find a protector.
3.95.6	May this prince live."
3.95.7	He saw this Samaveda.
3.95.8	He reconciled him with the formula, "Thy Dakṣa is the one who bestows, the one who besto ws."
3.95.9	The Dakṣas are the vital airs.
3.95.10	He thus placed the vital airs in him.
3.95.11	We choose Agni today,
3.95.12	The protector, the most desired,
3.95.13	The gentle, the most desirable, the wise, the most desirable.
3.95.14	The protector, most desired,
3.95.15	Come to the wealth, to the well-disposed, come to the well-willed, come to the body.
3.95.16	Come to the protector, to the much-desired.
3.95.17	Thus.
3.95.18	Man is indeed the protector.
3.95.19	That is what he reconciled him with.
3.95.20	This is the remedy, the expiation, the Sama.
3.95.21	They indeed made this remedy, the expiatory rite.
3.95.22	They make this expiatory rite a remedy.
3.95.23	This is indeed the desire-granting.
3.95.24	He desired this very thing.
3.95.25	This very thing was accomplished for him.
3.95.26	He who praises with this Sama attains whatever he desires.
3.96.1	He became angry and went to the people,
3.96.2	saying, "Do not speak untruth."
3.96.3	The fire-god's attendant fled from those of the Ikṣvāku lineage.
3.96.4	The rice which they had cooked in the evening was spoilt in the morning.
3.96.5	The rice which they had prepared in the morning was spoilt in the evening.
3.96.6	They said, "The Brahman is not noble, he is not a good man."
3.96.7	Their Agni went away.
3.96.8	"We shall recite this (hymn) to him."
3.96.9	They recited this (hymn).
3.96.10	He came as a Brahman is permitted by the king to come.
3.96.11	Having come, he desired: "May I see this Agni's Hara."
3.96.12	He saw this Sama.
3.96.13	He sang it.
3.96.14	He saw that this was the wife of Triyaruna, a Pisachi.
3.96.15	He covered her with a skin and sat on her.
3.96.16	He uttered this:
3.96.17	The young boy, the mother, the youth, the ocean, the cave, holds and does not give to the father.
3.96.18	The army of his enemies does not diminish, those in front see it hidden in the battlefield.
3.96.19	Who is this young boy that you, the young woman, have given birth to? The mother gave birth to a boy who was born in the autumn.
3.96.20	The embryo grew for many months. I saw the one who was born, whom the mother gave birth to.
3.96.21	Agni shines with great light, he makes all things manifest through his greatness.
3.96.22	He endures the deceitful Māyā goddesses, he punishes the Rākṣasas on the peak.
3.96.23	May the Agni-worshippers be in heaven, with sharp weapons to slay the Rākṣasa demons.
3.96.24	Even in his intoxication, they praise his radiance, the goddesses do not hinder him.
3.96.25	Thus indeed, Agni's Har, having risen up, burnt everything.
3.96.26	Then indeed, as each one of them did, Agni's Herdsman went away.
3.96.27	As each one of them went away, Agni cooked for them.
3.96.28	This is the radiance, the Brahmanic lustre, the Sama.
3.96.29	By this, Agni's herdsman found what had been taken away.
3.96.30	He who knows this becomes brilliant, lustrous, and radiant.
3.96.31	That is the half-verse. The form of the Shakaris is directly seen in the Shakarah day.
3.96.32	By that, one attains prosperity.
3.96.33	What Vrish saw, therefore it is known as Varsha.
3.97.1	Soma is the one who is praised by the Soma-pressers. This is the form of the Simanas.
3.97.2	"The verses beginning with 'Adhi ṣṇubhiḥ avīnaṃ' are connected with cattle and animals, for the purpose of securing animals.
3.97.3	For this is the day of animals.
3.97.4	The verses beginning with ‘Samudram na sanvaranāni agman' are connected with the ocean.
3.97.5	For this day is connected with water.
3.97.6	They have fewer syllables.
3.97.7	There are seven syllables in one verse, nine syllables in one verse; eleven syllables in one verse and twelve syllables in one verse.
3.97.8	This is the form of the Sakvaris, which is gradually attained.
3.97.9	In them, the form of the boundaries is like the Anupam.
3.97.10	From the Anutunna, indeed, offspring and cattle are born.
3.97.11	He who knows this is born with offspring and cattle.
3.97.12	Dhīto-ni, the son of Anūpa, desired, "May I be a king and a sage."
3.97.13	He saw this Sama.
3.97.14	He praised with it.
3.97.15	Then he obtained both, the Brahman and the Kshatra. Being a king, he became a sage.
3.97.16	He who knows this becomes a king and a sage.
3.97.17	Because he saw the Anupa, therefore it is called Anupa.
3.98.1	Then the Rathantara, which ends with the Manava step.
3.98.2	Therefore it is performed on the Rathantara day.
3.98.3	Manu desired, 'May I beget many offspring and cattle. May I create human offspring.'
3.98.4	He saw this Sama.
3.98.5	He praised with it.
3.98.6	Then he indeed begot many offspring and cattle
3.98.7	These are the human offspring.
3.98.8	One who knows this indeed begets many offspring and cattle.
3.98.9	Then they say, "Those very creatures that he created, they attacked him."
3.98.10	He desired, "May I destroy the Rakshas."
3.98.11	He saw this Sama.
3.98.12	He praised with it:
3.98.13	"O Agni, Manu has placed you as light for the eternal people.
3.98.14	Kanva, born of truth, anointed, whom the farmers worship,
3.99.2	He thought, "This indeed is the Veda."
3.99.3	He desired, "May I go from here to the world of heaven and attain stability."
3.99.4	He saw these two Sāman chants.
3.99.5	He praised with them.
3.99.6	They approached him in the form of two golden boats.
3.99.7	He stood on them.
3.99.8	They ferried him across.
3.99.9	Then indeed he finds the path to the sacrifice.
3.99.10	He who knows this finds the path to sacrifice.
3.99.11	Because Manu saw it, therefore they are called Manavas.
3.99.12	Then the beginning of the sacrifice is the Vamra, the retreat is the Pratyasara.
3.99.13	One begins with the sixth day and retreats with the fourth.
3.99.14	The gods, by means of their efforts, obstructed the Asuras from the sacrifice.
3.99.15	Vamra Vaikhanasa, desiring cattle, practised austerity.
3.99.16	He saw this Sama.
3.99.17	He praised with it.
3.99.18	He approached this Iḍā in the middle and approached the Iḍā in excess above.
3.99.19	The Iḍā is cattle.
3.99.20	The Iḷā in excess is the earth.
3.99.21	Then he (Agni) successively obtained the animals.
3.99.22	This is the Paśvy (animal-winning) Sāman.
3.99.23	He who knows this, successively obtains animals.
3.99.24	That which Vamra Vaikhanasa saw, therefore it is called Vamra.
3.100.1	Now the Agniya Triṇidhāna (Sāman) for the arrangement of the three Savanas.
3.100.2	By Pavamāna indeed food is given to the gods.
3.100.3	It has a middle-ending for the special purpose of food.
3.100.4	Agni desired, "May I be the best eater of food among my own people."
3.100.5	This is the expansion of food.
3.100.6	He who knows this obtains food and becomes the best eater of his own people.
3.100.7	Because Agni saw it, it is called the Agniya Triṇchanam.
3.101.1	They also call it the Sākamasva.
3.101.2	Kakshivat asked Priyamedha,
3.101.3	"Are you burning or not burning?" Priyamedha said,
3.101.4	That is his name.
3.101.5	He said, "I am speaking to you for the sake of offspring."
3.101.6	Then indeed, of Kakshīvat, the son of Nākuli, the grains of Priyangu or sand were filled.
3.101.7	Of them, he used to throw one every year.
3.101.8	He gave him life for that much time.
3.101.9	He indeed knew the horse sacrifice from Priyamedha.
3.101.10	He desired: "May I go from here and obtain a reply."
3.101.11	He saw this Sama.
3.101.12	He sang it.
3.101.13	Then he saw the reply.
3.101.14	He rushed at Kakshivat.
3.101.15	Seeing him rushing, he said, "Throw this my bladder into the water. I shall see him who will reply to me."
3.101.16	Then he went straight to him.
3.101.17	He said, "He who performs the Ṛk but not the Sāman, he shines but does not blaze.
3.101.18	But he who performs both the Ṛk and the Sāman shines and blazes.
3.101.19	This I say to you, my father, this was said by your father, this was spoken by your grandfather. Thus Priyamedha made it known.
3.101.20	This is the brilliance, the brahminical splendour, of the Sāman.
3.101.21	By this he removed the sin of his ancestors.
3.101.22	He becomes brilliant and lustrous, and removes the sin of his forefathers, he who knows this.
3.101.23	Because he saw the horse together, therefore it is called Saakamaasva.
3.101.24	Because Soma is variegated, therefore they are variegated, for cattle are variegated in form.
3.102.2	Peace is childhood.
3.102.3	What they praise with childhood, it is indeed peace.
3.102.4	And they say, "With childhood Indra struck Vritra with the Shakaris."
3.102.5	That is indeed the childhood of childhood.
3.102.6	It is indeed for the destruction of the enemy.
3.102.7	He who knows this destroys the hated enemy.
3.102.8-15	Prajapati's eye fell out. It fell down. He desired, "May the eye enter me again." He saw this Sama. He praised with it. Then the eye entered him again. The horse, having become pure, entered him again. That is the light of the eye.
3.102.16	The light indeed enters him.
3.102.17	This is the eye-like Sama.
3.102.18	He who knows this, his eye does not perish, he does not become blind.
3.103.1	Now the Mahanama hymns.
3.103.2	The Mahanama hymns are indeed the progenitors of offspring.
3.103.3	Cattle are always with their calves.
3.103.4	These are the Mahanama hymns, the wives.
3.103.5	Therefore men who are pregnant shine less.
3.103.6	For he is the constant embryo of them.
3.103.7	Cattle are born with their young.
3.103.8	Therefore cattle, when pregnant, are more beautiful.
3.103.9	For he is the constant womb of them.
3.103.10	Now the Vamadevya.
3.103.11	Cattle are the Vamadevyas.
3.103.12	They become cattle-owners by praising with it.
3.103.13	Then in the Barhaspatya sacrifice, the Paṅkti-s are performed on the Paṅkti day. The Paṅkti-day is for cattle.
3.103.14	This day is for cattle. It is for the cattle to be enclosed.
3.103.15	They are Athakārava and Adhyardhaedam. The form of the Śakvarī-s is directly seen on the Śakvara day.
3.103.16	By that the form is accomplished.
3.103.17	They say, "That is the place where the serpent Vādy bathed. One should find the place of rest and the sacred place on the other side."
3.103.18	The Shakyas are cows.
3.103.19	Their place of rest and sacred place on the far side is where the Athakara and Adhyardha Cedas are.
3.103.20	One who knows this crosses over evil and attains prosperity.
3.103.21	That is the Iḍa-sāman of the Acchāvāka.
3.103.22	The Iḍa is cattle.
3.103.23	They indeed stand firm in cattle.
3.104.1	The gods and the Asuras were contending.
3.104.2	The gods approached Prajapati, saying, "Give us a metre by which we may overcome the Asuras."
3.104.3	He practised austerity.
3.104.4-11	He, having performed austerities, sought to know the Self. What he sought to know, that is the nature of the Simanas. She said to them, "Create!" "By what?" "By what you desire." They created the Simanas, going upwards, and then created the Simanas. That is their nature. They measured.
3.104.12	Among them, he placed the three Vedas.
3.104.13	He stretched them.
3.104.14	Among them, he placed these three worlds.
3.104.15	He stretched those.
3.104.16	He said, "This is indeed a great measure of them."
3.104.17	What he said, "This indeed is a great measure of theirs," that is the greatness of the great-minded ones.
3.104.18	These indeed are the great-minded.
3.104.19	These are called the Mahānāmnī (hymns) because they are recited in a hidden manner.
3.104.20	He gave them to the gods.
3.104.21	The gods praised them today.
3.104.22	They were not able to do so tomorrow.
3.104.23	That is why the Śakvarī (hymṇs) are called Śakvarī because they praised today and were not able to tomorrow.
3.104.24	One who knows this is able to learn.
3.104.25	The gods did not give them to us.
3.104.26	They again gave them to Prajapati.
3.104.27	Having stayed with Prajapati for a year, they departed.
3.104.28	He said, "Why have you departed?"
3.105.1	They said, "You know the sounds of the cattle belonging to Indra.
3.105.2	Give them to us so that we may be able to make sounds.
3.105.3	The Brāhmaṇa who knows us is the one who proclaims.
3.105.4	He gave these Indra-related proclamations to them.
3.105.5	He gave her the proclamation of Agni and the proclamation of the chariot.
3.105.6	He gave this one the proclamation of Vayu and the proclamation of cattle.
3.105.7	The sound of the rain, the sound of the drum, he has given to that one.
3.105.8	These are indeed the sounds of Indra.
3.105.9	Having stayed for a year, they went away.
3.105.10	He said, "Why did you go away?"
3.105.11	They said, "You know the games of Indra.
3.105.12	Give them to us so that we can play.
3.105.13	The Brāhmaṇa who plays with his progeny and cattle knows us."
3.105.14	He gave them these Indra-games, saying, "Indra, Indra, Indra."
3.105.15	These are indeed their Indra-games.
3.105.16	Having stayed for a year, they departed.
3.105.17	He said, "Why did you depart?"
3.106.1	They said, "You do not know our forms."
3.106.2	They said, "Give us those forms by which we will become beautiful."
3.106.3	The Brahman who knows us is beautiful."
3.106.4	He gave them the forms.
3.106.5	The form that appears to her when she is born in the rainy season, when the dust has settled, he gave to her.
3.106.6	Whatever is the form of the sky when it is free from dust in the rainy season, that he gave to her.
3.106.7	These indeed are their forms.
3.106.8	Having stayed for a year, they departed.
3.106.9	He said, "Why did you depart?"
3.106.10	They said, "You do not know our names."
3.106.11	Give us those by which we may be called.
3.106.12	The Brahman who knows this is the true one.
3.106.13	He gave them names.
3.106.14	He said to this one, "You are Bhuh." He said to this one "You are Bhuvah." He said to that one, "You am Svah."
3.106.15	These are indeed their names.
3.106.16	Having stayed for a year, they departed.
3.106.17	He said, "Why did you depart?"
3.107.1	They said, "You do not know the calves."
3.107.2	Give them to us, by which we may be with calves.
3.107.3	The Brahman who knows us is a calf."
3.107.4	He gave them the calves.
3.107.5	He gave Agni to her, Vayu to the atmosphere, and Aditya to the yonder world.
3.107.6	These indeed are their calves.
3.107.7	Having stayed there for a year, they left.
3.107.8	He said, "Why did you leave?"
3.107.9	They said, "You do not know the bulls."
3.107.10	Give us those bulls by which we can be with bulls.
3.107.11	The brahmin who knows us is the bull."
3.107.12	He gave them the bulls, these are the Athakaras.
3.107.13	These are indeed their bulls.
3.107.14	Having stayed for a year, they went away.
3.107.15	He said, "Why did you go away?"
3.108.1	They said, "You know only one form of us.
3.108.2	Give that to us by which we may become endowed with forms.
3.108.3	The Brahman who knows this is true.
3.108.4	He gave them one form, namely, water.
3.108.5	This is indeed their one form, namely water.
3.108.6	Having stayed for a year, they left.
3.108.7	He said, "Why did you leave?"
3.108.8	They said, "You know only one of our names.
3.108.9-14	Please give us that by which we may be called by names. The Brahman who knows this is the one who is called by names. They said, "This is our one name, Indra." This indeed is their one name, namely Indra. Having stayed for a year, they departed. He said, "Why did you depart?"
3.109.1	They said, "You do not know the Tṛptis."
3.109.2	"Give us those by which we may be satisfied."
3.109.3	"May the Brahman be satisfied with offspring and cattle who knows us."
3.109.4	He gave them these Tṛptis, these one-syllabled ones.
3.109.5	These indeed are their Tṛptis.
3.109.6	Having stayed for a year, they departed.
3.109.7	He said, "You may go away."
3.109.8	They said, "You do not know about the sowing, you do not know about ploughing, you do not understand about the cattle-sheds."
3.109.9	Give them to us so that we may have sowing, ploughing, and cattle-sheds.
3.109.10	The Brahman who knows this has sowing, ploughing, cattle-sheds.
3.109.11	He gave speech to them.
3.109.12	Speech indeed is everything here, nothing exceeds it.
3.109.13	"Indeed, indeed" (is said) because of them. Speech indeed is Agni. The cattle are indeed Gavya. "Indeed, indeed" is Indra. The cattle are Aśvya.
3.109.14	"Indeed you, O Pūṣan" (is said). This is indeed the goat and sheep.
3.109.15	"Indeed the gods" (is said), this is indeed the enclosure.
3.110.1	Now the great names.
3.110.2	The vital airs were indeed seven in the beginning.
3.110.3	From them he created this seven-footed Sakvari.
3.110.4	He who knows this attains all vital airs and all life.
3.110.5	For the seven-footed one, the six-footed one, and the six seasons.
3.110.6	He who thus knows gives himself to the seasons.
3.110.7	To the six-footed one, the five-footed animals, the Panka (verse).
3.110.8	He who knows this becomes possessed of cattle.
3.110.9	To the five-footed one, speech with four feet, the Anushtubh (verse), the foundation.
3.110.10	He speaks with speech who knows this.
3.110.11	To the four-footed one, three-footed (verse), the splendour, the Brahmic lustre, the Gayatri (verse).
3.110.12	One becomes lustrous, possessed of Brahmic lustre, who knows this.
3.110.13	To the three-footed one, the two-footed man.
3.110.14	He who knows this is not killed by the killer of men.
3.110.15	To the two-footed one, one-footed man. The man.
3.110.16	As if two men were following each other.
3.110.17	Therefore a man knows another man, a man becomes the follower of a man, he obtains followers.
3.110.18	Many are his followers, and he does not find the return of his manhood. He who knows thus.
3.111.1	Having collected all those metres, Indra killed Vritra with them.
3.111.2	Because he was a great killer, therefore the names are great.
3.111.3	Because he could not, therefore the Sakvaris.
3.111.4	Because he did the Matvi, therefore the Matvis.
3.111.5-11	The boundary-lines which he broke, therefore they are boundary-lines. Then indeed the lesser ones created the boundary-lines. The boundary-lines are indeed called the best. He who knows this becomes the best of his kinsmen. These indeed are the names of Indra. When Indra desired to have union with the great names, they said to him, "He shall give us." "What?"
3.111.12	That is why they are called Indra.
3.111.13	He gave them that (name).
3.111.14	Therefore they are called Indra (s).
3.111.15	This is indeed their beloved secret name, namely Indra (s). 
3.111.16	He who, knowing this, protects them, becomes dear to them in the future. He sees what is dear.
3.111.17	Therefore they are said to be of great names, indirectly.
3.112.1	He is indeed great.
3.112.2	These are his names.
3.112.3	He indeed gives up his name.
3.112.4	That which is placed in front with two feet, that is indeed a man.
3.112.5	And those three feet which are in the front, those are indeed animals.
3.112.6	The first is called Bhāsat.
3.112.7	Animals are born from the rear.
3.112.8	Therefore, Bhāsat is called the first.
3.112.9	Now the three northern steps are the calf, the second, and the man.
3.112.10	Now the three northern steps, the two are the neck and head, and the one is the head. And the last step is the foot.
3.112.11	The second came after, therefore the best should be done for the beloved.
3.112.12	This is what is given to them, what is learned, what is to be enjoyed.
3.112.13	When the calf is born first, then the heifer, then the bull, then what is given to her, what is learned is enjoyed.
3.112.14	Now if one wishes, "May what is given to this (cow) be not learned, not enjoyed,"
3.113.1	One should make the heifer first, then the calf, then the bull.
3.113.2-7	The calf is indeed the unappropriated, the unenjoyed, of her. If one wishes, "May he be without cattle," one should place the calf between her and him. The calf is cattle. One places cattle between her and him.
3.113.8-13	He places Rudra in his own place. This is the discussion. Now, just as this is known to them, so should it be praised. This is indeed the first great name. Agni is its companion. This is second. Vayu is its companion. This is third. The sun and the moon are its companions.
3.113.14	Those who know the three-fold repetition of the heart-grasping of those (goddesses), their houses become like those who are satisfied and rough within.
3.113.15	One is indeed the heart-grabbing of those (goddess).
3.113.16	Therefore, they satisfy the animals by covering the heart with the letter 'e'.
3.113.17	Now those who know the ornaments of these (verses) and are adorned with them, they dwell in the houses with the rays, gold, necklace, elephant, horse, chariot and horse-chariot.
3.113.18	The Stoma is indeed the ornament of these (verses).
3.113.19	One should sing as if adorning them, as if beautifying them.
3.113.20	Indeed, these forms stand bought for him who knows this.
3.114.1	The great names are the waters.
3.114.2	The calf of them is indeed the sun.
3.114.3	Those waters which flow towards the east, they flow towards this rising sun.
3.114.4	And those which flow towards the west, they flow towards the setting sun.
3.114.5	If they were to ask, "Which god do these waters that flow every day seek?"
3.114.6	The answer would be, "This one."
3.114.7	Some say, "The wind is the calf of the Mahānāmnī goddesses."
3.114.8	For he heats these worlds and these directions.
3.114.9	These worlds are the Mahānāman.
3.114.10	Therefore, when there is a wind from the east, they hope for rain.
3.114.11	Just as a cow does not give milk when she is not milked, so it is when there is a breeze from the east and there is no rain.
3.114.12	The Mahānāmnī verses are indeed cattle.
3.114.13	The excrement is in the cowpen itself.
3.114.14	They say, "One should praise with the excrement first, then with the Mahānāmnīs."
3.114.15	The abode is first, then the cattle.
3.114.16	The animals come together in the pen.
3.114.17	They say that the pen is the excrement of the animals.
3.114.18	If there were no animals, there would be no excrement.
3.114.19	When a man obtains animals, he then encloses the pen for protection.
3.114.20	Therefore one should praise with the great names first.
3.115.1	They say, "One should offer praise to the cow dung only once, after the cows have been praised. But there are many animals, of different kinds, that come together in the same pasture."
3.115.2	If there are two kinds of animals, then there are different kinds of offspring.
3.115.3	One should offer praise in succession to the cow dung.
3.115.4	Then all the animals that belong to the herd become one.
3.115.5	The Ida-s are the excreta.
3.115.6	One should praise with excreta in succession.
3.115.7	Thus all the herds become (prosperous).
3.115.8	The Ida-s are excreta.
3.115.9	The Ida-is the animals and the excreta is the abode.
3.115.10	They establish those animals in the abode.
3.115.11	Having placed it down, they praise for the completeness of the Sama.
3.115.12	This is the entire form of the great goddesses, namely, water.
3.115.13	They are the waters, for the prosperity of form.
3.115.14	They say, "Where should these be taken?"
3.115.15	Their investigation is this: They should take them to the Vasatīvarī waters, sprinkle Soma, and then consume it.
3.115.16	But it becomes like churned (water), exhausted.
3.115.17	They pour the cooked rice into the uncooked rice.
3.115.18	Some say, they should offer the oblations of the third pressing.
3.115.19	The oblation is the sacrificer, the water is food.
3.115.20	He anoints the sacrificer with food.
3.115.21	The sacrificer is indeed the master of the later life, the next day, the day after tomorrow.
3.115.22	They are like those who have been scratched.
3.115.23	Some say, one should take it to the sacrificial pit.
3.115.24	The sacrificial pit is the womb of the sacrifice, and water is the seed. He thus establishes the seed in the womb.
3.115.25	If one knows this, the seed that has been sprinkled becomes born.
3.116.1	They say, the fires are removed, the site remains, the embryos are dried up, if one were to take them to the Cātvāla.
3.116.2	One should take them to the Āstāraṇa.
3.116.3	Indeed, the Āstāraṇas are the Dhishnyas of the Udgātṛ and the sacrificer.
3.116.4	The Āstāraṇa is the abode.
3.116.5	Indeed, they establish those desires in the abode.
3.116.6	Having offered them in the prescribed manner, he should offer them in the inner enclosure.
3.116.7	Thus they become both offered and unoffered.
3.116.8	Just as the two breaths here are not specified, so also these two Dhishnyas are not specified.
3.116.9	These two vital airs are firm and unyielding, these two are the supports, they are firm and do not move.
3.117.1	The Asuras indeed were in the beginning in these worlds.
3.117.2	The gods were like their dependents, for faith was dependent on austerity.
3.117.3	They, offering oblations, became distressed, and deposited energy, strength, power, and vigour in themselves.
3.117.4	Therefore, the Asuras desired it.
3.117.5	When they were desiring it, they put it into the water, saying, "Let not the Asuras obtain it."
3.117.6	Therefore, even now, when enemies are approaching, they hide their wealth, saying, "May not the enemies obtain it."
3.117.7	It then escaped from the gods and did not reach the Asuras.
3.117.8	The gods saw that this was the fatigue of a year.
3.117.9	They became exhausted by it.
3.117.10	They rested above it.
3.117.11	It stood touching the heaven.
3.117.12	What stood touching the heaven, that is the touching of the touched.
3.117.13	The touched are indeed these (sacrifices).
3.117.14	They are called the Prishthas (sacrifices) in a hidden way.
3.117.15	He who knows this touches all his desires.
3.117.16	If one desires something, one should strive for a year. One will certainly attain it.
3.117.17	For the striving is limited to a year.
3.118.1	The waters were the wives of the gods.
3.118.2	They desired union.
3.118.3	Vayu moved on their backs.
3.118.4	They placed the embryo.
3.118.5	The gods said, "Let us create."
3.118.6	They created Ratha-nara on the first day.
3.118.7	The sound of the chariot followed it.
3.118.8	Therefore, at the Rathantara hymn, they make the sound of the chariot.
3.118.9	They said, "Let's create."
3.118.10	They made Brihat on the second day.
3.118.11	The sound of rain was produced from that.
3.118.12	Therefore, at the Brihat stotra, they beat drums.
3.118.13	The rain god becomes rainy.
3.118.14	They said, "Let us create."
3.118.15	They created Vaikara on the third day.
3.118.16	The sound of the village was produced from that.
3.118.17	Therefore, at the praise of Vaivāsvata, they make the village sound.
3.118.18	They said, "Let us create!"
3.118.19	They created Vaivāsvāta on the fourth day.
3.118.20	The sound of Agni followed it.
3.118.21	Therefore, at the praise to Vaivāsvāda, they churn Agni.
3.118.22	They said,
3.118.23	They created the Shaka-vara on the fifth day.
3.118.24	From that came the sound of water, which created another.
3.118.25	Therefore, they recite the Shaka-varas' praise while placing water nearby.
3.118.26	They said, "Let us create!"
3.118.27	They created the Raivata on the sixth day.
3.118.28	From it came the sound of cattle, which created another.
3.118.29	Therefore, at the Rāivata Stotra, they make the sound of cattle and unite the calves with their mothers.
3.118.30	They said, "Let us create!"
3.118.31	They said, "This much is enough!"
3.118.32	These are indeed the Indra-related sounds that they make.
3.118.33	All the Indra-like sounds are in this (verse), all the auspicious words speak in this (verse) for him who knows thus.
3.118.34	Those gods, having taken the womb of Vamadeva, went upwards.
3.118.35	In the middle of this six-day Pañcahas, they placed this (verse).
3.118.36	Now those hymns which are praised, they go to the west; and those which are not praised, they go east.
3.118.37	He who is the strongest and the best in a village, he goes to the west; he who is not so, he goes east.
3.118.38	He performs the sacrifice without injury, who knows thus.
3.118.39	For from this (sacrifice) the two yoked oxen draw together, and one of them draws more than the other.
3.118.40	Therefore the Vamadevya is the last (hymn).
3.118.41	For it draws back (to the beginning).
3.118.42	This is the completion, this is the peace, this is the foundation. This indeed is the sacrifice, namely the Vamadevyam.
3.118.43	Therefore, whatever day they praise, that day follows, creating and pacifying.
3.119.1	That ray is for intoxication, that is the form of the boundaries.
3.119.2	Skilled in the waters, the best of mountains.
3.119.3	Like a hawk, he has approached his birthplace.
3.119.4	The bright, blind, divine wind, washed in the waters, is drunk by men.
3.119.5	Thus they are the waters.
3.119.6	For the waters are this day.
3.119.7	The cows are satisfied with milk.
3.119.8	The immortal one has shone like a horse, the steed, the swift one.
3.119.9	Thus they are the cattle, the animals. For the securing of animals.
3.119.10	For the animals are this day.
3.119.11	The Madhu and the Madhu-rasa are the Madhu-verses.
3.119.12	Madhu is the juice.
3.119.13	The third pressing is like a child.
3.119.14	In that these are Madhu-verses, they put juice into it.
3.119.15	By this they make it grow.
3.119.16	In them the Gayatri is as described in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.119.17	Then the Santani.
3.119.18-23	This twelve-day sacrifice is indeed the extended speech. They extend it by means of the Sāntani. The Sāntani indeed is the vital airs. Speech is extended by the vital airs. Therefore, when it is Sāntani, it is for the extension of the vital airs. They extend speech by means of the vital airs." The Sātanī is indeed these worlds, and the Mahānāmnī are these worlds.
3.119.24	The reason why it is called 'Santinī' is that it is for the continuity of these worlds.
3.119.25	These worlds are sustained for him who knows this.
3.119.26	'The bright, great fame' - the word 'abhi' is the form of Rathantara.
3.119.27	This is the Rathantara day.
3.119.28	(May they) increase the cattle for the cattle-loving (goddess). The cattle-loving (verses) are cattle-loving. They become cattle-loving for the purpose of securing cattle.
3.119.29	For this day is indeed cattle.
3.120.1	The Cāvana verses are recited on it.
3.120.2	Cyavana Bhārgava knew the Brāhmaṇa of Vastu Pasa.
3.120.3	He said to his sons, "He who knows the Brāhmaṇas of Vastu Pasa,
3.120.4	Having placed him in the house, he went away three times.
3.120.5	They said, "We will not be able to go with you."
3.120.6	They said, "They will say that we have killed our father."
3.120.7	He said, "No, you will be more prosperous by that. By that alone I hope to be young again."
3.120.8	Having left him, he went away. He told them,
3.120.9	Having entrusted him to Sarasvati in childhood, he went on three more journeys.
3.120.10	He desired, "May I be young again after being old, may I find a maiden as my wife, and may I sacrifice with a thousand."
3.120.11	He saw this Sama.
3.120.12	He praised it.
3.121.1	While he was praising it, Sharayata Manava settled down with a village.
3.121.2	The princes, the cowherds, and the shepherds struck him with clods of earth, cowdung, and dust.
3.121.3	He became unconscious.
3.121.4	His mother did not know her son, nor did the son know his mother.
3.121.5	He said, "What is this man doing here? What has he seen that this has happened?"
3.121.6	They said to him, "Is there not anything else? This old man is lying down in the best place."
3.121.7	Today the princes, cowherds, and shepherds are smearing him with cow dung, clay, and dust.
3.121.8	From that it became like this."
3.122.1	He said, "That was Chyavana Bhārgava.
3.122.2	He knows the Brahman of Vastu."
3.122.3	Then indeed your sons, having left you, went away.
3.122.4	Having quickly approached him, he said: "Salutations to you, O sage."
3.122.5	"May Bhaga be favorable to you, O Sharatyas."
3.122.6	Then indeed Sukanya Sharatyas was virtuous.
3.122.7	He said: "Give me Sukanya."
3.122.8	She said: "No."
3.122.9	"Tell me about another wealth."
3.122.10	She said "No."
3.122.11	The Brahman of the house knows the Veda.
3.122.12	"He said, "Let us go to the village today after placing this here."
3.122.13	"They said, "Let's consult and then reply."
3.122.14	They said, "Having consulted, we will obtain one, two, or three wealth by this means. Then we will obtain everything here."
3.122.15	"Let us give these to you."
3.122.16	They gave her to him.
3.122.17	She said to him, "O maiden, he is old and decrepit, not fit to be followed."
3.122.18	"When we shall be united, then you may follow."
3.122.19	She stood by him as he followed the united village.
3.122.20	She said, "Run around, O friend, to save the living."
3.122.21	She said, "If you go, then I will go."
3.123.1	The black serpent indeed stood up against her.
3.123.2	She, having been disappointed by that, sat down.
3.123.3	Then indeed the two Ashvins, the physicians, the two who are not drunk with Soma, wandered here and there.
3.123.4	They, having approached her, said: "O maiden, this is an old man, he is not all, he is not able to be your husband."
3.123.5	She said: "No."
3.123.6	"Since my father gave me to him, I shall be his wife."
3.123.7	That is why there was the cry.
3.123.8	Then they went away.
3.123.9	He said, "Girl, what was that cry?"
3.123.10	"Two men came to me and said, 'With whatever is the best of forms, that form we shall take.'
3.123.11	What did they say to you?"
3.123.12	"You are a young girl, and he is an old man. It is not proper for you to be his wife."
3.123.13	"What did you say?"
3.123.14	"I said, 'I will be the wife of the one my father gives me.'"
3.124.1	"That pleased him.
3.124.2	He said, "Those two are the Asvins, the physicians, the two who know the Dārvīhoma, and they are performing this rite without Soma.
3.124.3	They will come here tomorrow and will speak.
3.124.4	You should tell them, 'You two are not all-knowing, you two are not the two gods who are performing this rite and are not drinking Soma.'
3.124.5	My husband is all-knowing, he is the one who drinks Soma."
3.124.6	"Who is the lord of that? If we are to be Soma-drinkers."
3.124.7	"He is my husband," she said.
3.124.8	"By him alone I shall again be young."
3.124.9	The next day they came to her and said the same thing.
3.124.10	She said, "You are both not all-knowing. You are both gods, but you are not Soma-drinkers.
3.124.11	All my husband is the one who drinks Soma."
3.124.12	They said to him, "Who is the lord of that? We two would drink Soma."
3.124.13	He said, "This is my husband."
3.125.1	They said, "O sage, please make us drink Soma."
3.125.2	"So be it," he said.
3.125.3	"You two have made me young again."
3.125.4	They made him a child of Sarasvati.
3.125.5	He said, "O maiden, all of us will come up looking alike. You will know me by this mark."
3.125.6	They all came up looking alike. By the form that was the best among forms, he was known.
3.125.7	Knowing him, she was afraid, "This is my husband."
3.125.8	He said to him, "I have fulfilled your desire, whatever desire you had."
3.125.9	You have become young again.
3.125.10	You should instruct me as to how I can be young again."
3.126.1	He said, "The gods are performing sacrifices in Kurukshetra with the Apashirsha sacrifice.
3.126.2	They do not attain that desire which is the desire of the sacrifice.
3.126.3	The head of the sacrifice was cut off.
3.126.4	What Dadhyan Atharva saw, that he went to.
3.126.5	He will tell you that.
3.126.6	Then you will be Soma-drinkers.
3.126.7	What is meant by 'the head of the sacrifice being cut off' is that Sun.
3.126.8	That itself is the Pravargya.
3.126.9	They approached Dadhyancha Atharvaṇa.
3.126.10	They said to him, "O sage, we have come to you."
3.126.11	"For what purpose?"
3.126.12	"We want to recite the head of this sacrifice."
3.126.13	He said, "No."
3.126.14	Indra himself had seen it.
3.126.15	He said to me, 'If you tell this to anyone else, I will cut off your head.'
3.126.16	Therefore, I am afraid."
3.126.17	He said, "Recite the hymn after me, starting from the head of this horse."
3.126.18	He said "Yes"
3.126.19	They said, "We see you both speaking."
3.126.20	They both placed their own heads down and put the head of the horse on it. Then they spoke to each other while singing the Samaveda and reciting the Rgveda and Yajurveda.
3.126.21	They told Indra, and he spoke to the head of Ashva from his own head.
3.127.1	Indra understood that and spoke to them.
3.127.2	He rushed and cut off his head, which became the head of Ashvas.
3.127.3	Then what was his own head, that they placed on these two wise ones.
3.127.4	They approached the gods, who were performing a sacrifice without their heads.
3.127.5	They said, "We are performing the sacrifice without the head."
3.127.6	"They did not attain that desire which is the desire of the sacrifice."
3.127.7	"Who knows the head of the sacrifice?"
3.127.8	"We do."
3.127.9	"That should be restored."
3.127.10	"You two should take the Graha."
3.127.11	They took this Asvin Graha.
3.127.12	They said, "You two are the Adhvaryus. You two, knowing this, will reattach the head of the sacrifice."
3.127.13	"So be it."
3.127.14	They became the Adhvaryu priests.
3.127.15	Then those two became the Soma sacrifices.
3.128.1	Then Chyavana Bhārgava, having become young again, approached Sharīratha Mānava.
3.128.2	He performed the sacrifice for him in the eastern region.
3.128.3	He gave him a thousand.
3.128.4	He performed the sacrifice with that.
3.128.5	This is what Chyavana Bhārgava did. Having praised with this Sama, he became young again and obtained a maiden as his wife. He performed the sacrifice with a thousand.
3.128.6	These are the desires in this Sama. One obtains these very desires.
3.128.7	Whatever desire one may have, if one praises with this Sama, that desire is fulfilled.
3.128.8	And indeed, whatever food Chyavana Bhārgava desired, that he obtained from Sarasvati even as a child.
3.128.9	This is the Sama for obtaining food.
3.128.10	One who knows this obtains food, becomes the best among his kinsmen.
3.128.11	What Chyavana Bhārgava saw, from that it is called Chyavana.
3.128.12	The breath is the child of the earth, thus they approach the form of an animal.
3.128.13	For animals, the child becomes.
3.128.14	Among them, the Krosa is the slayer of enemies, with Indra as the Sama.
3.128.15	He who knows this slays the enemy, the hater, and goes to Indra's presence.
3.128.16	It is a verse of the Iḍa metre. The Iḍa metre is cattle.
3.128.17	This day is for cattle. It is indeed for the securing of cattle.
3.129.1	"O Soma, flow for the winning of strength." The Anushtubh verses are connected with strength. Strength is food. It is indeed the securing of food.
3.129.2	"Flow, O Soma, purified by the strainer,
3.129.3	For Indra, for Vishnu, for the gods, the sweetest."
3.129.4	Thus they are of Vishnu. Vishnu is the sacrifice. For the commencement of the sacrifice itself.
3.129.5	In them, the text of the Gaurīvit is stated.
3.129.6	Then there is the Aṣṭedaḥ Padastobha, which is not deficient in the Ida.
3.129.7	By that, these one-hoofed animals stand.
3.129.8	Prajapati, while creating the creatures, was seized by sin from the head.
3.129.9	He desired, 'May I slay the evil one!'
3.129.10	He saw these verses and hymns.
3.129.11	He praised with them.
3.129.12	With them he slew the evil one.
3.129.13	One should sing them as if driving out.
3.129.14	As if driving out, he struck the evil one in the head first.
3.129.15	He strikes off evil as it were from the head. He who knows thus, strikes off evil from the head.
3.130.1	In the beginning there was only the Rsis and their mantras and not the cattle.
3.130.2	They desired, "Let us obtain cattle."
3.130.3	They saw cattle in the year.
3.130.4	They released them with this eight-fold hymn and the Padasthobha.
3.130.5	They said, "There is indeed."
3.130.6	They released them with six.
3.130.7	They said, "There indeed is."
3.130.8	They released with four.
3.130.9	They said "There indeed is, indeed."
3.130.10	They were released with two.
3.130.11	These indeed are the animals, namely the Padasthobha hymns.
3.130.12	The animals are this day.
3.130.13	He who knows this becomes possessed of animals.
3.130.14	All of them are in the Jagati metre.
3.130.15	Animals are in the Jagatī metre.
3.130.16	Therefore, even those animals which are one-hoofed stand in this (day), because all are in the Jagata metre.
3.130.17	For all animals are in the Jagatı metre.
3.131.1	Then the two-versed section of the Partha (Sāman) is the form of the second day.
3.131.2	This is the second day, with the Ayatanas.
3.131.3	Now the Rishbhah Shakarah.
3.131.4	Animals are the Simas, animals are the Revatas, animals are the Rishbhas.
3.131.5	They thus release the Rishbha among the animals for the sake of union and procreation.
3.131.6	He who knows this is born with union.
3.131.7	He stands firm with two and two deities.
3.131.8	Therefore, when a bull is born, it has two feet.
3.131.9	These are the four-footed deities.
3.131.10	Therefore it moves on two feet.
3.131.11	It generates on four feet.
3.131.12	He who knows this is born with offspring and cattle.
3.131.13	It is five-footed.
3.131.14	On the fifth day, it is performed for the sake of prosperity of form.
3.131.15	The moon, the horse, flows, the cows, the streams, the cows, they are related to cattle, for the sake of securing cattle.
3.131.16	For this day is related to cattle.
3.131.17	In them, the Dasaspati hymn is as explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.131.18	Now the Yajñāyajñiya hymn is as explained
3.131.19	We desire to kindle thee, O Agni. They become the 'coming ones'.
3.131.20	The Upavasatha rites are indeed a cutting off of the sacrificial rites.
3.131.21	Therefore they become the 'coming' ones, for the sake of the continuity of the sacrifice.
3.132.1	In them there is the victory.
3.132.2	The gods and the Asuras were contending in these worlds.
3.132.3	In this world, those gods desired: "We may conquer these worlds, may conquer the Asuras, may conquer our rivals."
3.132.4	They saw this Sama.
3.132.5	They praised with it.
3.132.6	With it they conquered these worlds, conquered their rivals, the Asuras.
3.132.7	That by which they conquered these worlds is the nature of conquest of the conqueror.
3.132.8	He conquers these worlds, he conquers his rival, his enemy, who knows thus.
3.132.9	It is performed on the Paṅkti day, because cattle are Paṅktis.
3.132.10	This day is for cattle, for the securing of cattle.
3.132.11	They call it the Vamadevya of two kinds.
3.132.12	The animals are the Simas, the animals are the Revatis, the animals are (the animals) of the two-fold sacrifice, the Vamadevya.
3.132.13	They become possessed of cattle by praising with this.
3.132.14	And whatever is done here on this day after the Sakvaris, as if cruel, that they appease with these two Hinkaras.
3.132.15	Then the Sāman for Indra and Soma, the slayer of enemies.
3.132.16	He who knows this goes to Indra's assembly, slaying the enemy, the hater.
3.133.1	The three Brahmas saw the third, Sumitra saw the third, Brihaduttha saw the third.
3.133.2	And because the third Triyaja is performed on the first day, the first Triyaja becomes endowed with Brahman.
3.133.3	Now when the third day is performed with the Barhad-uktha, then the third day is made Brahmanic by that very (performance).
3.133.4	By these Sāmans, these three days are made Brahmanic.
3.133.5	It has five syllables as its end, because it is the form of the fifth day, for the continuity of the five-day (rite).
3.133.6	"Soma is the singer, O Indra, he is the singer." The word 'asau' is a form of 'sima'.
3.134.1	Among them, the Mahāvaishvānara (Sāman).
3.134.2	By this, Vishvamitra obtained the greatness and the earth, and the cattle in succession.
3.134.3	This is the cattle-winning Sāman.
3.134.4	He who knows this obtains the greatness and the Earth, and the cattle, in succession.
3.134.5	Indra desired to kill Vritra.
3.134.6	He approached Vishvamitra, saying, "O Rishi, we run to you. Please instruct us here."
3.134.7	Vishvamitra saw this Sama Veda.
3.134.8	He praised with it.
3.134.9	Then Indra killed Vritra.
3.134.10	He said, "This was indeed great for Vishvamitra."
3.134.11	That itself is the greatness of Maha-Vishvamitra.
3.134.12	It is indeed for destroying enemies.
3.134.13	He who knows this destroys his enemies.
3.134.14	This is the three-fold Iḍa. The Iḍa is the cattle.
3.134.15	Cattle are the animals of this day. It is for the purpose of obtaining the cattle that are in front.
3.134.16	The three Iḍas are indeed the remedy.
3.134.17	This is indeed the auspicious and peaceful speech, namely the three Iḍas.
3.134.18	Now, when the Trisṭubh is sung on the fifth day, it is by that that they appease the Trisṭubha and the Stoma.
3.134.19	The seasons departed from the sun.
3.134.20	He desired, 'May not my seasons depart, may they turn towards me.'
3.134.21	He saw this Sama.
3.134.22	He praised with it.
3.134.23	The Hayas (horses) are the Hayas (horses), for the Hayas are his horses, as if they were horses.
3.134.24	From that time the seasons did not depart from him.
3.134.25	Then they returned to him.
3.134.26	He entered them.
3.134.27	He mounted them.
3.134.28	He shines in the seasons and in the year, having mounted this glory.
3.134.29	Because Viśvāmitra saw it, it is called Mahāvaishvamitra.
3.134.30	It is the Ida of the Acchāvāka Sāman.
3.134.31	Ida is cattle.
3.134.32	They indeed establish themselves in cattle.
3.135.1	"The light of the sacrifice flows, the honey is dear." This is the form of the Simanas.
3.135.2	The form of the Simānas and the Revatīs is the same.
3.135.3	Or they are created from the boundaries.
3.135.4	He says, "Light."
3.135.5	He thus places light in the creatures.
3.135.6	"Light" and "moves" indeed are the forms of the Gāyatrī.
3.135.7	This day is extended by the Gāyatrīs.
3.135.8	"The father of the gods, the generator, the bestower of wealth," indeed Prajapati is the father of the gods; he is the generator, he is the bestower of
3.135.9	This is the Prajapati day.
3.135.10	He places the jewel, the most intoxicating, the most jealous, the most passionate, the most tasty, in the two worlds.
3.135.11	For this is indeed the tasty day.
3.135.12	He who has drunk the taste of the fifth day, that became this day.
3.135.13	And this is indeed the taste.
3.135.14	The Kalasa-vessel is flowing forth, the bull is crying. At the morning pressing they let loose the Revați-verses for the purpose of reproduction.
3.135.15	The lord of heaven, the hundred-streamed, the discerning. What is a hundredfold, a thousandfold, that is the form of the Jagati.
3.135.16	This is the Jagati day.
3.135.17	Hari, the friend, lies down in the houses of the friends, being cleansed by the unpierced rivers, the strong ones become the great form.
3.135.18	This is the Brhat day.
3.135.19	The Pavamana flows before the rivers, before speech, going before the cows.
3.135.20	You enjoy the great wealth of strength, with your own weapons, O Soma, you are praised by the Soma-pressers.
3.135.21	Thus it is the foremost of the foremost.
3.135.22	For this day is the foremost, namely the Bharata.
3.135.23	The Trayastrimsa is the foremost of Stomas.
3.135.24	They follow him in the form of the Revatis.
3.136.1	These are the Jagatls, of the form of the Jagat, and are prosperous in the form of a day.
3.136.2	Where they prosper in the form of days, there they prosper.
3.136.3	He who knows thus prospers.
3.136.4	"The strong ones have flowed forth" is the Anurūpa (verse). The Anurūpa verses are the repetition of the past.
3.136.5	They repeat the six-day creation.
3.136.6	They say, "They begin with the form of the day with the Stotriya (verse) and with the Anurūpā (verse) of the Sāman."
3.136.7	The Stotriya and Anurūpa are the verses.
3.136.8-13	Prāṇa is the Stotriya, Apāna is the Anurūpa. They prosper and go forth by means of Prāṇa and Apāna. The Soma-pressings are of cows and horses. The Soma drinks are of the bright and the heroic. Thus they are of cows and of animals. They are for the securing of animals, for this is the day of animals.
3.136.14	Being cleansed by the Rtas, being rubbed by the rays of the sun,
3.136.15	The Soma flows in the unchanging course.
3.136.16	Thus is the form of the Revati verses.
3.136.17	They become the Vishvavas, the All-gods, for the giver.
3.136.18	For this day is indeed dedicated to the All-gods.
3.136.19	The Soma flows the heavenly, the earthly,
3.136.20	The Soma flowing the atmospheric.
3.136.21	Thus he begins with these worlds.
3.137.5	Thus they are the Vrusanvatis, the form of the great one.
3.137.6	This is the Barhaspatya day.
3.137.7	"Come, O great one, to sing!" Thus they are the Avatis, for non-transgression.
3.137.8	For now they go to the end, as it were.
3.137.9	"Let us not go beyond the six days."
3.137.10	The Revati stars are the milk of the great names, as it is said, "They milked the dear honey."
3.137.11	The Revati stars are indeed the milk of the Great Names.
3.137.12	"The great ones follow thee," the Tristoma is great.
3.137.13	The Revati indeed are that.
3.137.14	The rivers flow.
3.137.15	With which you will delight the cows.
3.137.16	The ocean is anointed in the waters, the firm support of heaven.
3.137.17	Soma is purified in the filter, for us.
3.137.18	Thus they are water-related.
3.137.19	For this day is indeed water.
3.137.20	The bull roared, tawny-colored. Thus they are related to the bull, for the form of the bull is great.
3.137.21	For this is the great day.
3.137.22	The great friend is not seen. This day is great, the thirty-third.
3.137.23	His words are rubbed with strength, the seer.
3.137.24	With which you shine for the sake of joy.
3.137.25	We seek you, O Indra, for the sake of delight, the creator of worlds.
3.137.26	For your praise, for the great.
3.137.27	O Indra, you are the giver of cows, of men, of horses, of strength.
3.137.28	The Self is the first of the sacrifice.
3.137.29	Thus they are connected with cows and animals, for the purpose of securing animals.
3.137.30	For animals are this day.
3.137.31	O Indra, pour down for us the juice, the strength, in a stream,
3.137.32	Like Parjanya, the rain-giver,
3.137.33	Thus it is of ten verses. Viraj has ten syllables. Viraj is food. For the purpose of obtaining food.
3.138.1	"The verse beginning with "Suna and Soma, you conquer" is the next one of ten verses."
3.138.2	They obtain Viraj, food, in an ascending order.
3.138.3	The sages, desiring prosperity, saw the rising of the agreeable speech, and said, "Do thou make us prosperous, do thou make us prosperous."
3.138.4	They praised with it.
3.138.5	Then all of them prospered.
3.138.6	All prosper who, knowing this, praise with this ten-versed hymn.
3.138.7	They place it above, in the ascending order.
3.138.8	The sixth day is indeed the juice.
3.138.9	So that it may not be spilled.
3.138.10	They place the Udarka above in the same way as one would smear the water of a cloud, so that the juice may not be spilled
3.138.11	It consists of four verses, for the purpose of securing the four-footed animals.
3.138.12	The verses are indirect, for the purpose securing the two-footed animals.
3.138.13	He becomes like the Nārāśaṃsa verse, for the attainment of both desires.
3.138.14	What is divine and what is human, they place above.
3.138.15	The sixth day is indeed the sap.
3.138.16	For not exceeding it.
3.139.1	Now indeed Tarantpurumīḍha and Vaitadāśvī, while they were taking a man from Dhvasra, took much, like two grumblers.
3.139.2	They both felt the pain through their fingers.
3.139.3	They both desired, "May this pain not be ours. May it be taken as if it were taken, but not accepted."
3.139.4	They saw this four-verse hymn and recited it.
3.139.5	Then their pain became pleasant, as if taken but not accepted.
3.139.6	If one who has received a gift should desire (to give it back), he should say, "May this gift of mine be a gift, as if it were not received." He should return it with this four-verse (hymn).
3.139.7	It indeed becomes a gift for him, as if it had been received.
3.139.8	These are the last verses of the Soma-verses, which are recited in accordance with the past.
3.139.9	They recite the six days in accordance with the creation.
3.139.10	You flow for the cattle, for the strong, purifying,
3.139.11	O Sanadvaja, you flow around.
3.139.12	They become the Parvati (verses). The form of the end.
3.139.13	For this day is the end.
3.139.14	May you flow for us with the wish of cattle, all the Paristubh verses,
3.139.15	Singing with Jamadagni.
3.140.2	Now, the verse, "He who is worthy of this praise, O Jātavedas," is a verse addressed to Agni. The sixth day is made to be a pair by that alone.
3.140.3	"We are united like a chariot with the mind," is a verse that makes a pair.
3.140.4	The Hotṛ priest blesses the sacrificer in the earlier days, and the Udgātṛ priest in this one.
3.140.5	He who desires to obtain the blessing by means of the Saman, is as if he were being consumed.
3.140.6	"Therefore, it is said, "May I not be harmed in your friendship, O Agni, may we not be harmed in yours." By this they perform the atonement for the remedy."
3.140.7	Thus he is not consumed.
3.140.8	They place the Udarka above.
3.140.9	The sixth day is indeed the sap, for its non-consumption.
3.140.10	Just as one would smear water from a flood, so they put the excess above. For the sake of not letting the juice flow away.
3.141.1	"The Maitrāvaruṇa says, "The sun has risen for you."
3.141.2	"Now the Stotras and the Chandaḥs return, the Grahas return, the seasons return.
3.141.3	Now, as to why it is said, 'To you both', therefore this is offered in accordance with the seasons, and the other hymns are offered above.
3.141.4	Now this is offered above.
3.141.5	Maitrāvaruṇa are the two breaths, the out-breath and the in-breath.
3.141.6	If they had offered above, they would have injured the out-breath, the in-breath.
3.141.7	When they place the Uparva (bricks) above, it is for the release of the Prāṇa and Apāna.
3.141.8	"The verse "Break all the enemies". is addressed to Indra."
3.141.9	"The verse "O Agni, do thou destroy the wicked ones". is addressed as if to a slayer."
3.141.10	This is indeed the praise of the sacrificer, which is of the Brahman.
3.141.11	They destroy all the sin of the sacrificer in its own place.
3.141.12	Bring that wealth, the desirable, for whose sake all this is yours, of him who gives, he knows.
3.141.13	Bring that wealth, the desireable.
3.141.14	What you have done at Vīḍa, what at Sthira, what at Parshāne,
3.141.15	Bring that wealth the desirable.
3.141.16	Thus it is said.
3.141.17	Wealth, the desirable, are cattle.
3.141.18	Cattle are food.
3.141.19	The Udgātṛ priest, while reciting the benediction for the sacrificer, places them above and beyond.
3.141.20	The sixth day is indeed the essence. For the non-deterioration of that.
3.142.1	"For the priestly duties of the sacrifice." It is Indra-Agni.
3.142.2	Here Indra-Agni is chosen for the priestly duties. Having entrusted the sacrifice to Indra-Agni, one is released.
3.142.3	The extent of that is not known. It is the same as before. Indra and Agni alone perform the priestly duties from the east.
3.142.4	Men have milked this your sweet Madhu with mountains.
3.142.5	Indra and Agni, you know that.
3.142.6	This is the form of the Sakvaris and the Revatis.
3.142.7	The two who are satisfied, the two who are in the chariot, the two who slay Vritra, the two who cannot be defeated,
3.142.8	Indra and Agni, may they awaken him.
3.142.9	Thus it is the Vartra-destroying (hymn). It is at the end (of the sacrifice) for victory.
3.142.10	By this six-day (rite) the gods won (the war) in the beginning.
3.142.11	In that the Vartra destroying (hymn) is performed at the end with clarified butter, it is for victory and for the killing of the enemy.
3.142.12	He who knows this conquers and kills his hateful enemy.
3.142.13	They place the Uparişṭād-udarka (bricks) above.
3.142.14	The sixth day is the Rasa (juice). For the non-diminution of that.
3.142.15	Just as one would apply the water of a cloud, so they place the Uparishṭād-udarkas above for the non-diminishment of the Rasa.
3.142.16	The Stoma becomes thirty-three.
3.142.17	Thirty-three are all the deities.
3.142.18	All these deities are present in this (rite).
3.143.1	The Gāyatrī verses of the Madhyandina Pavamāna are addressed to Indra, Indra, the lord of Maruts. The Brihatī form is present.
3.143.2	This is the Brhatī day.
3.143.3	The verses are of the Parivati form. The form of the Anta is present.
3.143.4	This is the essence of this day.
3.143.5	"Thy essence, O Mitra, is the essence of the day, for this is the essence of that day."
3.143.6	He who has gone beyond the essence of the fifth day, that became this day.
3.143.7	This is indeed the essence.
3.143.8	May Varuna, the sage, drink.
3.143.9	Of Pavamana, O Maruts.
3.143.10	Thus they become Marutvatis.
3.143.11	The form of midday is indeed Marutvat.
3.143.12	The forms of the midday sun do not go away.
3.143.13	Among them, the Gayatri is the one mentioned in the Brahmana.
3.143.14	Now the Revati verses.
3.143.15	The animals are the Sima.
3.143.16	The animals, the Revati verses,
3.143.17	the animals, this day.
3.143.18	They become endowed with animals by praising with this.
3.143.19	The Shakyas shone with their splendor.
3.143.20	They were not touched by splendor.
3.143.21	The gods were afraid of their burning.
3.143.22	They said, "These will burn everything here."
3.143.23	"Let us pacify them."
3.143.24	Two of them were placed on one foot, one on the other.
3.143.25	On which one two were placed, that became the two-footed one; on which one one was placed, that became one-footed.
3.143.26	This very one became the three-footed Gāyatrī.
3.143.27	This is the same metre.
3.143.28	It was divided into two, for Bhūmi and for Śānti.
3.143.29	He who knows this becomes manyfold in progeny and cattle.
3.144.1	From the fifth day the gods created the sixth day.
3.144.2	Therefore they desired a dwelling place.
3.144.3	For him they found a dwelling place in the Revatī constellation.
3.144.4	He who knows this becomes the owner of the senses.
3.144.5	The Revatī stars are indeed cattle.
3.144.6	The midday is the self.
3.144.7	When they bring the Revatī stars to the midday, they establish the cattle in the self.
3.144.8	The Revati stars are indeed cattle,
3.144.9	the midday is the self.
3.144.10-15	Now, when they bring the Revati verses to the midday (pressing), they thus establish the sap in the self. The Revati verses are semen. The midday is the self. When they bring the Revatī verses to the midday, they thus establish the semen in the self. The Revati verses are the semen. The Raivata Sāman is semen.
3.145.3-6	If they were to be hidden by another Sāman, the milk would be hidden from the animals. If they are not hidden, then the milk is not hidden from the animals.
3.145.7-11	If the semen were to be lost, then the milk would be lost to the animals. "The semen is released by the thunderbolt, and it is released only with the Revatī constellation. "The semen is not lost by the thunderbolt." And thus the milk is not lost to the animals.
3.145.12	When they are divided into two, they do not go to both worlds.
3.145.13	The waters are the Revatī stars.
3.145.14	The Rāivata Sāman is in the waters.
3.145.15	If they were to perform the Rāivata as the Prstha in the Revatī, they would sink in the deep and not stand firm.
3.145.16	When the Vāravantīya is the Prstha, it is for stability.
3.145.17	The backs of the animals seem to be getting old when the sixth day arrives.
3.145.18	When the back is old, the semen does not remain.
3.145.19	Therefore, the Varavantiya Sāman is used, for the continuation of the northern rites.
3.146.1	The animals are made to graze with their calves.
3.146.2	When the animals graze with their calves, then they yield their desires.
3.146.3	The Revatī stars are the wish-granting cows for him.
3.146.4	One should make a wish for the Pavamāna (verses) if one desires, 'May the Revatī stars be wish-granting for me in that world.'
3.146.5	They indeed become wish-granting in that world.
3.146.6	One should wish for the Abhivarti (verses) if he desires, 'May they be wish-grantings for me in this world.'
3.146.7	In this world, they become the wish-yielding cows.
3.146.8	One who desires should place them in both worlds, thinking, "May they be the wish-yielding cow in both worlds."
3.146.9	In both worlds, they become the cow that yields what is desired.
3.146.10	They say, "The calves should be here, the mothers there."
3.146.11	The waters flow from the north.
3.146.12	They say that these are the waters, that these are the animals.
3.146.13	They say that the calves should be on this side and the mothers on that side.
3.146.14	When a father gives a son a share, he gives it to him on the northern side.
3.146.15	Therefore the calves should be to the north and the mothers to the south.
3.146.16	The gods and the Asuras competed for cattle.
3.146.17	The gods, with their calves, stood on the north, and the Asuras, with their mothers, on the south.
3.146.18	Those mothers, having been scattered, fled to their calves.
3.146.19	The gods supported the calves.
3.146.20	Having approached them, they attacked the Asuras.
3.146.21	They fled to the north.
3.146.22	He who knows this seizes the cattle of his enemies.
3.146.23	Therefore, the calves should be on the north and the mothers on the south.
3.147.1	Now the Vājadāvaryī verses.
3.147.2	Food is Vāja, food is Dāvaryī.
3.147.3	These are for the attainment of food.
3.147.4	Prajapati created beings.
3.147.5	They created hunger.
3.147.6	They ran to Prajapati himself. He gave them food with this very hymn.
3.147.7	They said, "He has given us the food of strength."
3.147.8	That is why the Vājadāvarīṇas are called Vājadāvariṇas.
3.147.9	This is the prosperity of food.
3.147.10	He who knows this obtains food and becomes the best among his kinsmen.
3.147.11	Now the Sūparna (is the beginning of the sacrifice).
3.147.12	The sacrifice indeed departed from the gods.
3.147.13	That being Suparna, he floated around.
3.147.14	Those gods desired, "Let us perform the sacrifice."
3.147.15	They saw this Sama.
3.147.16	They praised with it.
3.147.17	With it they began the sacrifice.
3.147.18	Now the sacrifice seems to have been interrupted on the sixth day.
3.147.19	That which is here as Suparna is for the beginning of the sacrifice.
3.147.20	Now, when they begin with this (Saurna) hymn the Suparna (the bird) which is moving about, therefore it is called Sauparna.
3.147.21	They also call it Krouncha.
3.147.22	"He (the sun) found the day which is like the cry of a crane."
3.147.23	The sixth day is like the cry.
3.147.24	Therefore it is performed on the sixth day.
3.147.25	It is the Iḍa (rite) because it is connected with the Iḍa.
3.147.26	The Iḍa rite is for cattle; this day is for cattle; (it is performed) for the securing of cattle.
3.148.1	Then the Bahisnihan rite of Ishovrīdhi is in the Bharata (rite).
3.148.2	Therefore it is performed on the Bharata day.
3.148.3	The seventh day is for the growth of the sixth day.
3.148.4	The sixth day is the progenitor of the seventh day.
3.148.5	Now, when they say, "That which is the food," they produce the seventh day from the sixth day.
3.148.6	When they say, "What is the growth," they grow as it were now.
3.148.7	Prajapati created the creatures.
3.148.8	They created the creatures that do not eat.
3.148.9	They ate one another.
3.148.10	He, Prajapati, thought, "How can these creatures of mine not be destroyed?"
3.148.11	He saw this Sama.
3.148.12	He praised them with it, saying, "May they grow through the Iṣa."
3.148.13	They grew together with him.
3.148.14	That is why the Iṣo-vṛdhiya is called Iṣo-vrīdhiya.
3.148.15	His wives grow together with him, who knows this.
3.149.3	Purifying, in the turn, Pavamana, in the imperishable, the bull roared in the forest.
3.149.4	Thus they become the verses of the bull.
3.149.5	This is the day of the Brihatis.
3.149.6	O Soma, purifier of the gods, flowing with cows, knowing the accomplished, you flow with cows. They become the verses of cows and animals, for the securing of animals.
3.149.7	For this is the day of animals.
3.149.8	The Sauṣavya is the form of the Sīmā.
3.149.9	The Sīmā are the Revatī.
3.149.10	They are called Vasiṣṭha's Pippalī.
3.149.11	Vasiṣṭha, whose sons were killed, desired, "May I beget many sons and cattle."
3.149.12	He saw this Sama.
3.149.13	He praised with it.
3.149.14	Then he, being very prosperous with progeny and cattle, went away.
3.149.15	He said, "This is the Pipal tree, by which I ran."
3.149.16	That is the reason why the Pipal tree is called Pipal.
3.149.17	The name of this tree is Pipal.
3.149.18	Progeny is Pipal, cattle is Pipal, heaven is Pipal.
3.149.19	Now, the reason why there is pepper is for the purpose of securing all this and for obtaining this.
3.149.20	What is above that is the form of the great one, on the great day.
3.149.21	By that, indeed, there is prosperity of form.
3.149.22	What Vasishtha saw, therefore, it is called 'pepper of Vasishtha'.
3.150.1	Now, the Ox-horned.
3.150.2-6	The Rāmaṇvatas, the Rāmaṇvas, the Rāmanvatas, the Kauṇḍinyas, the Kauṣṭakīyas, the Kauṇapāyas, the Kauṣāmbīyas, the Kāṇḍāyanas, the Kāṇvāyanas, the Kauśīkāyanas, the Kauravyas, the Kauṅkaṇas, the Kauṭṭas, the Kauñcīyas, the Kauravas, the Kauṇāpas, the Kauṇapayas, the Kauśāmbīyas. The Rāmaṇvās, the Rāvaṇas, the Rāmāṇvās, the Kauṇḍinyās, the Kauṣaṭkīyās, the Kauṇapas, the Kauṣambīyās, the Kāṇḍāyanyās, the Kāṇvīyās, Kauśīkāyanyās, Kauravyās, Kauṅkaṇās, Kauṭṭās, Kauṇcīyās, Kauravas, Kauṇāpās, Kauṇapayas and Kauṣambīyas. They are the Rāmaṇa-vās, the Kauṇa-pās, the Kau-ṣaṃbīyas, the Rā-maṇvās. They are Rāmaṇvā, Kauṇapa, Kauṣaṃbā, Rāmaṇva. They are Kauṇapa, Rāmaṇa, Kauṣaṇḍa, Kauṇapa. They are Kaurava, Kauṇapaya, Kauṇapa and Kauṣaṃba.
3.150.7	He is the same as Ushanas, Kavya.
3.150.8	He indeed ascended heaven by means of Yamuna.
3.150.9	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.150.10	One who knows this ascends heaven by means of water.
3.150.11	What Ukshnorandhra Kavya saw, therefore it is called Ukshnorandha.
3.150.12	Then, 'The boat of the waters', because he saw the boat in the waters.
3.151.1	Then, 'The winner of the prize',
3.151.2	Food is the prize.
3.151.3	When a cow, a horse, or a man has eaten enough food, then he becomes a prize.
3.151.4	The gods and the Asuras contended for food.
3.151.5	The gods desired, 'We shall win the food of the Asuras.'
3.151.6	They saw this Sama.
3.151.7	They praised with it.
3.151.8	They won the food of the Asuras, saying, "We have won the food."
3.151.9	That itself is the winning of the food of the Vājajitas.
3.151.10	This is the winning of food.
3.151.11	He who knows this wins food, seizes the food of his enemies.
3.151.12	It has five syllables and is the Niṣadha.
3.151.13	The sacrifice is fivefold.
3.151.14	Those who come to this day exceed the measure of the sacrifice.
3.151.15	Therefore it has five syllables and the Niṣadhas, so that they do not exceed the measure of sacrifice.
3.152.1	Then the Varuna-sāman.
3.152.2	Varuna, the king, was like the most honoured of the other deities.
3.152.3	He desired, 'May I be consecrated as king of all the gods.'
3.152.4	He lived the life of a student with Prajapati for a hundred years.
3.152.5	Prajapati said to him, 'This is your kingdom, this is your form.'
3.152.6	Go.
3.152.7	The gods will make you king.'
3.152.8	He approached the gods.
3.152.9	Seeing him coming, the gods descended.
3.152.10	He said to them, "Do not descend."
3.152.11	"You are my brothers."
3.152.12	"You all are as I am."
3.152.13	They said, "No."
3.152.14	"We see in you the form of our father Prajapati."
3.152.15	They descended upon him.
3.152.16	Therefore they placed this royal throne.
3.152.17	On it they consecrated him for kingship, the Vasus, for the kingdom of the Rudras, the Adityas, for the kingdom for oneself, the Visve Devas, for the kingdom over all, the Maruts, for the kingdom to be obeyed by all, the Sadhyas, Aptas, and Parameshthyas.
3.152.18	This is the prosperity-bestowing sacrifice.
3.152.19	He who knows this attains prosperity and goes to the kingdom.
3.152.20	Because Varuna, the king, saw it, it is called Varuna-saman.
3.153.1	Now the Goṣṭha (Sāman).
3.153.2	This is the Goṣṭhas of the Śakvarī and Revatī (Sāmans).
3.153.3	The Goṣṭha is for the protection of cattle.
3.153.4	Cattle are protected in it.
3.153.5	He who knows this becomes possessed of cattle.
3.153.6	Prajapati created cattle.
3.153.7	They were created from this (earth) and went away.
3.153.8	They were not able to stop them on the first day.
3.153.9	They were unable to stop them on second day.
3.153.10	They could not stop them on the third day.
3.153.11	They did not stop them on fourth day.
3.153.12	They stopped them on the fifth day.
3.153.13	They also did not stop them.
3.153.14	They stopped on the sixth day with this very hymn.
3.153.15	He said, "This is the Sama of my cattle."
3.153.16	That is the very reason for the name "Goṣṭha."
3.153.17	This is the Paśvy (cattle-related) Sāman, Goṣṭha.
3.153.18	Cattle are held in it.
3.153.19	One who knows this becomes cattle-rich.
3.153.20	It is as if it is prohibited here, "Here is Ida, here is Ida."
3.153.21	This is what he did to them, and by this he kept them away from the front.
3.153.22	"They rub him with ten strokes, the mother of the Sindhu." What is Sindhu-mat is like the ocean, that is the form of this day.
3.153.23	This is the day of the waters.
3.153.24	They say that those who make the last (verse) in the Gāyatrī verses, go to the Pavamāna verses ending in Tristubh.
3.153.25	They become connected with the sun.
3.153.26	And also with Indra.
3.153.27	By that they do not go to the Pavamanas ending in Tristubha.
3.153.28	In them the Vamadevya with the word 'here'.
3.153.29	Animals are the boundaries.
3.153.30	Animals are the Raivata.
3.153.31	The Vamadevya is like the animals here.
3.153.32	Those who praise with this become like the animals.
3.153.33	This is like a prohibition. Here they rub the mother of the ocean, the one who is ten-streamed. This is what he did to them. He also repelled them with this very thing.
3.154.1	"May the Revatīs be for us at the feast." The Revatīs are so called.
3.154.2	They obtain equality from equality.
3.154.3	The last verses of the midday pressing are Gāyatrī verses.
3.154.4	These are Gāyatrīs.
3.154.5	It is like passing from equality to equality.
3.154.6	Now the other metres have been used up, but the Gāyatrī has not been used up.
3.154.7	The praises are worn out, the hymns are worn out, and the Vasat-call is worn out.
3.154.8	The five days are seasonal, the sixth is non-seasonal.
3.154.9	When the Hotras perform the seasonal sacrifices separately, then by that the sixth day becomes seasonal.
3.154.10	Among them, the Vāravantīya.
3.154.11-14	This indeed is the Rêvât, the Rêvâty, that which is in the Rêvatîs, the Vâravantiya. He becomes Rêva, Rêva, the Rêvaty, he is born, he who knowing thus praises in the Rêvátîs with the Vâra-vantiya. This indeed is the Bṛhat, the Rêvata, that which is the Rêvatis, the Vârayantiya. The sixth day is Bṛhat.
3.154.15	On that very day the sixth day is performed in the Barhaspatya manner.
3.154.16	Indeed, the six-day Prsthya is Agni Vaisvānara.
3.154.17	The Prstha days are indeed the seasons.
3.154.18	The seasons are the year.
3.154.19	Agni Vaisvānaran is the year.
3.154.20	He is fierce, powerful, and burning.
3.155.7	He did not ward it off with the Vairāja.
3.155.8	He did not ward it with the Mahānāmni.
3.155.9	He did ward it off with Revatī.
3.155.10	He did indeed ward it off with Vāravantīya.
3.155.11	What he did ward off, that is the Vāravant īya's Vāravant iya-ness.
3.155.12	That which is the Vāravaṇtīya Sāman, it is for the protection of the sacrifice.
3.155.13	Prajapati created this sacrifice, the six-day Prsthya.
3.155.14	He desired a firm footing in it.
3.155.15	He found it in the waters.
3.155.16	In them he desired a firm footing with the Rathantara.
3.155.17	He did not find it.
3.155.18	In them with the Brihat he did not find it
3.155.19	In them with Vairupa he did not find
3.155.20	In them with Vaisharadja he did not find.
3.155.21	In them by the Maha-naminis he did not find.
3.155.22	In them he did not find (the Soma).
3.155.23	In them he found (the Soma) by means of the Vāravantīya (Sāman).
3.155.24	What he found, that is the Vāravantyīya-ness of the Vāravaṇtīya.
3.155.25	In this very (Sāman) they establish the sacrifice.
3.155.26	This is indeed Agni Vaiśvānara, the Vāravantiya.
3.155.27	The waters are the Revatī.
3.155.28	Now, since the Varavantiya is (sung) in the Revati (stars), therefore the waters are born from Agni.
3.155.29	Indeed, when the sixth day arrives, the metres seem to grow old.
3.155.30	But when something is old, no seed remains.
3.155.31	Therefore the Varavantiyas are (sung) in order that the rites of the northern (stars) may be propagated.
3.156.1	He said to Abhipratarana, who was lying down old:
3.156.2	"Your sons have divided your property."
3.156.3	"He was a Ghosa."
3.156.4	"Who is Ghosa?"
3.156.5	His sons said to him, "O venerable one, your sons are dividing your property."
3.156.6	He said, "I am Suśrava, the one who is behind. When this brahmin is alive, his sons should receive the property."
3.156.7	"I am the good healer."
3.156.8	Just as one would give a gift to a living person, so it is when the Rāivata day comes, the Vāravantīya Sāman is chanted.
3.156.9	Then they perform the other Pavamāna Sāmans.
3.156.10	Then Gareya Ashadhi asked Ashadha Bhallalayan, "How is it that these many different verses were not recited on the sixth day?"
3.156.11	He replied, "Six kings of Pancala know this."
3.156.12	He said, "You know only this much. We know more than this."
3.156.13	Now, the reason why the Vāravantīya is performed on the day without the Prsthastoma is that this day is not very extensive.
3.156.14	Now, indeed, he asked Aruṇāruṇi, "O Aruṇāruņi, why do the Satyas of the Revanta family not generate offspring?"
3.156.15	"Why do the Satyas not generate offspring?"
3.156.16	The first syllable "re" is used to indicate semen.
3.156.17	He did not reply.
3.156.18	He won him by that.
3.156.19	If he had replied, then the Revatas would have been semen, and the Revatas are semen. There is no semen in semen.
3.156.20	Now semen is the son. These (verses) go to the end of the son.
3.156.21	When they reach the sixth day, they are not born beyond that.
3.156.22	Therefore, the Satya-s who are the sons of Reto-dha generate offspring.
3.156.23	Therefore, those who are the sons and grandsons of Reto-dhas generate offspring."
3.156.24	Then there is the Vamadevya.
3.156.25	The Vamadevya is indeed cattle.
3.156.26	Those who praise with this become endowed with cattle.
3.156.27	"The six verses beginning with 'The creator of good forms, the protector' are recited at the beginning. They are recited on the sixth day.
3.156.28	The six days are completed by this.
3.157.1	In them, Rishabha is Raivata.
3.157.2	Animals are Simas, animals are Revatas, animals are Rishabha.
3.157.3	They thus let loose the bull among the cattle for the sake of union and propagation.
3.157.4	He who knows this is born with a mate.
3.157.5	They allot the greater part to the eastern half.
3.157.6	Therefore cattle eat and carry the greater part with the eastern and the western half.
3.157.7	They milk with the eastern half and propagate with the western half.
3.157.8	He who knows this, obtains both the milk of a cow and the milk of a buffalo.
3.157.9	"The two worlds, O Indra, are yours" - these are the six verses in the sixth day.
3.157.10	They are completed by the same six days.
3.157.11	The gods and the Asuras competed for cattle.
3.157.12	The Asuras went to the ocean with the cattle.
3.157.13	The gods desired, "Let us seize the cattle of the Asuras."
3.157.14	They saw these signs and these verses, the goddess Janitri gave birth to the auspicious Janitri.
3.157.15	This is the form of the sign.
3.157.16	With them they seized those cattle.
3.157.17	These are the verses about cattle.
3.157.18	One who recites these verses becomes a possessor of many cattle.
3.158.1	In them, the hawk is made to be the carrier for non-abandonment.
3.158.2	Indeed, the hawk is worthy of carrying this day.
3.158.3	The gods, desiring heaven, practiced austerity.
3.158.4	They saw this Sama.
3.158.5	They praised with it.
3.158.6	Then he, having become a hawk, carried them to the heavenly world.
3.158.7	They said, "Having gone to the heavenly world, the hawk, having become us, brought this hymn to the heavenly world."
3.158.8	That is the hawk-ness of the hawk.
3.158.9	This is the heavenly hymn.
3.158.10	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.158.11	Indra, having become a hawk, with this Sama, struck down the Asuras.
3.158.12	That is why the hawk is called a hawk.
3.158.13	It is indeed for the destruction of the enemy.
3.158.14	He who knows this destroys his hateful enemy.
3.158.15	It becomes the Iḍa of the Acchāvāka.
3.158.16	The Iḍa is indeed cattle.
3.158.17	They indeed establish themselves in cattle.
3.159.1-7	The verses of the Pavamāna Soma are "The best of mountains, the best of mountains" (RV 10.10.1). The verses of the Ārbhava Soma are "The most excellent of mountains" (10.11.1). The Pavamāna Soma verses are "The best" (10,12.1). The Ārbhava Soma verses are "Most excellent" (10-13.1). The pavamāna Soma verses have the Gāyatrī metre. The Ārbhava verses have the Anustubh metre. The pavamāna verses are "The most" (10.-14.1). The ārbhava verses are "The excellent" (11.15.1). The last day is the third pressing. The Soma flows through the filter. In all intoxicants you are. Thus the verses are intoxicating. The intoxicant is the juice. The third pressing is like a daughter. 
3.159.8	Whatever they are, they are full of Soma. They put the juice into it. They thus nourish it with this.
3.159.9	"You are the sage, you are the poet." "You" means the form of the great one.
3.159.10	This is the day of the great one (Bṛhaspati).
3.159.11	The honey is born with the light.
3.159.12	In all the intoxicants you are.
3.159.13	All the gods are in you.
3.159.14	Thus they are the Viśva-vats.
3.159.15	For this day is indeed the Viśvadev.
3.159.16	The gods have attained joy.
3.159.17	In all the intoxications you are.
3.159.18	Thus they place them above in an ascending order.
3.159.19	The sixth day is indeed the juice, for its non-injury.
3.159.20	In them, the Gāyatrī is as explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.159.21	Then there are three Vedanvatas.
3.159.22	Sharayata, the human, performed a sacrifice in the eastern region.
3.159.23	They made Harsha his officiating priest.
3.159.24	Both gods and humans drank Soma together.
3.159.25	Both gods, and humans drank the best Soma.
3.159.26	In that (sacrifice) Chyavana Bhargava took the cup from the Ashvins.
3.159.27	Indra took the cup, saying, "Who is this unknown one who is moving about with a cup?"
3.159.28	The learned Bhārgava replied, "Who is worthy to examine that cup, whom we should give it?"
3.160.1	The gods were angry, the sages were angry.
3.160.2	They, the Maruts, with nine and nine (members), with hands holding thunderbolts, stood thus: "Now we shall encircle this (earth) and then crush it all."
3.160.3	Then indeed the sages called out to Madāsura.
3.160.4	He struck the sky with his head and it became a great tumult.
3.160.5	Agni said to Indra, "Let your anger depart. They are superior to us.
3.160.6	If he were to anger them, nothing would be left here."
3.160.7	"We are born from them."
3.160.8	Agni alone removed his anger.
3.160.9	Indra, free from anger, fled with the gods.
3.160.10	Their sacrifice was without Indra, without the gods.
3.160.11	They desired: "May our sacrifice be with Indra, with the gods."
3.160.12	That Bhārgava, knowing these, saw the common ones.
3.160.13	With them he praised.
3.160.14	With them, he invoked Indra.
3.160.15	With them his anger was appeased.
3.160.16	Then Indra returned to their sacrifice.
3.160.17	Then from them, without departing, it became.
3.160.18	Then this sacrifice with Indra and the gods became.
3.160.19	These indeed are the hymns with Indra and the Gods.
3.160.20	For him whose sacrifice is with Indra and the Devas, Indra does not depart from his sacrifice, he does not depart from the sacrifice of him who knows this.
3.160.21	The animals indeed are the performers of the rites. These verses are performed by them.
3.160.22	They release this bull, the performer of rites, among them for the sake of union and procreation.
3.160.23	He who knows thus is born with union.
3.160.24	What the performer of rites Bhārgava saw, therefore they are called Vaidānavatī.
3.161.1	Then indeed the Asura Mad became afraid.
3.161.2	He said, "Do not call me in vain. Do not throw me away."
3.161.3	They said, "We will drink," thinking they would drink Sura. They brought it to Varuna's sacrifice.
3.161.4	There was no one who was not afflicted by it.
3.161.5	There Mad is indeed the Asura.
3.161.6	This Asura Mad was thrown into Sura.
3.161.7	He who knows the sound of the Vasus, he who knows the sound, the form of the Revatis,
3.162.1	Among them is one long, of the Brihatis.
3.162.2	For this day indeed the Brihat is performed.
3.162.3	The gods, desiring heaven, practised austerities.
3.162.4	They saw this Sama.
3.162.5	They praised with it.
3.162.6	It brought them to heaven, having become long.
3.162.7	They went to the heavenly world and said, "This Sāman has become long for us."
3.162.8	That is the length of the long one.
3.162.9	This is the heavenly Sāman.
3.162.10	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.162.11	Your friends are for your joy, they become joyful.
3.162.12	They thus bestow the juice and the intoxication at the third pressing.
3.162.13	Sing to the purifier.
3.162.14	The child is delighted with oblations, with the forms.
3.162.15	Thus they approach the form of an animal.
3.162.16	The child becomes an animal.
3.162.17	The verse "Indra, being pressed by the mothers like a calf, is being pressed" is recited. They are recited as "having cows" and "having cattle". It is for the purpose of securing cattle.
3.162.18	Because this is the day of cattle.
3.162.19	The verse "The divine Madhu is purified by the minds" is recited. It is recited as "having a boundary".
3.162.20	Because this is a day of boundary.
3.163.1	The verse is recited as "For Karna-shravas".
3.163.2	Indra, having struck Vritra with the thunderbolt, thought, "I am not thirsty." He was amazed.
3.163.3	His ears became equal.
3.163.4	He did not hear in the Tamya (scale).
3.163.5	He desired, "May I be deaf and hear with my ears."
3.163.6	He saw this Sama.
3.163.7	He praised with it.
3.163.8	Then he became deaf and heard with his ears.
3.163.9	He said, "I heard with my ears."
3.163.10	That itself is the reason for Karnaśravas's name.
3.163.11	One who knows this becomes deafless and hears with his ears.
3.163.12	That itself is called Gauloma.
3.163.13	Gauloma Angirasa, desiring cattle, practiced austerities.
3.163.14	He saw this Sama.
3.163.15	Therefore it is praised.
3.163.16	He approached this Iḍā.
3.163.17	Iḍā is cattle. From there he obtained cattle.
3.163.18	This is the cattle-obtaining Sāman.
3.163.19	One who knows this obtains cattle, becomes one with many cattle.
3.163.20	Because Gāloma Āṅgirasa saw it, therefore it is called Gāloma.
3.163.21	The Soma-streams flow forth, the drops, most skilful in our praise.
3.163.22	The Mitra-s, the kinsmen, the faultless.
3.163.23	Thus is the form of the Revati-s.
3.163.24	In them the Gaurīvitta is said to be the Brāhmaṇa.
3.164.1	Now the Madhucyutni-dhana, the Barhaspatya.
3.164.2	Therefore it is performed on the last day. The last day is the end of the world, and honey is the end of tastes, and heaven is the end of worlds. We have attained the last day and the last world with the last Saman.
3.164.3	Now about the Kraunchi.
3.164.4	Angiras, having gone to the east, found the day.
3.164.5	This day is like going to the east, because it is the sixth.
3.164.6	Therefore, they are performed on the sixth day.
3.164.7	They are called Udvata and Shammda.
3.164.8	The gods indeed went upwards, to the heavenly world.
3.164.9	That they went upwards to the heavenly world is the Udvata, the Udvattvam.
3.164.10	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.164.11	He who knows this indeed goes upwards to the heavenly worlds.
3.164.12	Now the Sama of the Shammadas.
3.164.13	The gods, when they were victorious, fled from these worlds.
3.164.14	They desired, "May these worlds not turn away from us.
3.164.15	May they not flee from us."
3.164.16	They saw this Sama.
3.164.17	They praised with it.
3.164.18	Then these worlds turned back to them.
3.164.19	Then they became those who did not flee from them.
3.164.20	They said, "These worlds are indeed peaceful."
3.164.21	That is the reason for Shammda's name.
3.164.22	These worlds are peaceful for him, these worlds turn towards him.
3.164.23	These worlds do not depart from him who knows this.
3.164.24	This is the upward form, the form of the great, on the great day.
3.164.25	By that, one attains the fullness of form.
3.164.26	O Indra, flow on, flow on, bring me wealth, O Indra, in the river.
3.164.27	The sun, whose speed is like the wind, and the giver of many gifts, has given to the poet.
3.164.28	This is the form of the Revati verses.
3.165.1	Among them, the Snosht verse.
3.165.2	By this, Agni Vaiśvānara shines.
3.165.3	They sit together for a sacrifice, saying, "Let us shine."
3.165.4	They shine with it.
3.165.5	Now, indeed, Agni Vaiśvānara is just like these embers.
3.165.6	He desired, "May my flames be born, without being burnt."
3.165.7	He saw this Sama.
3.165.8	He praised with it.
3.165.9	Then his flames and flames were born.
3.165.10	These are indeed his flames, namely, the flames.
3.165.11	That is his radiance, his brahmic glory.
3.165.12	He who knows this becomes radiant, brahmic, and shining.
3.165.13	That is as if it were stopped, the form of the end.
3.165.14	For this day is indeed the end.
3.165.15	Just as one would call out to a person who is going away, saying, "Come here, come to your mother," in the same way, these Stotras are called out at the end.
3.166.1	Then the Yajñāyajñiya hymn, with the stated Brāhmaṇa.
3.166.2	Then these become two-footed for the purpose of not exceeding the measure of the metres.
3.166.3-8	The days are now spent, the metres are two-footed. When they are performed here, it is by that alone that this day is made spent. Now, Keśin Dārbhya sang: "Always on the mountain, even with a leaf, one lives well. When one does not find a dwelling, then one runs to hope."
3.166.9	Just as the Brahmanas are, so should you make the metres which are to be attained. The Dvipada is two-footed.
3.166.10	The six-day (Satra) is indeed the animals, and the Dvipada is the human being among the metres.
3.166.11	When they are performed here, they thereby place the human being among animals.
3.166.12	Therefore the human being stands above the animals.
3.166.13	Now, this world is heaven, the six-day Pañcahas sacrifice. The sacrificer is the foundation. He is two-footed.
3.166.14	When they perform the Parivatsa rite above the six-day Pancahas sacrifice, they lead the sacrificer to the heavenly world.
3.167.1	When the sun was rising, the metres were unable to rise.
3.167.2	Those two-footed metres said, "Having rested on you, we shall undertake this."
3.167.3	They said, "Your food shall be ours."
3.167.4	They said "Your food shall become ours."
3.167.5	The Brahman is indeed the two-footed metres. Here and hereafter, these are his food.
3.167.6	These metres, having rested on the two-footed (verse), ascend this sun and these sacrificial rites.
3.167.7	If they were to ask, 'Why are the two-footed verses performed on the sixth day?' one should reply, 'For stability.'
3.167.8	Therefore they are not interrupted here.
3.167.9	These are they: 'O Agni, you are our last protector.'
3.168.1	The Gaupayanas were the pupils of Asamați and Rathaprouṣṭha.
3.168.2	They performed a Sattra at Khāṇḍava.
3.168.3	Then Asamați and Rathāprouṣṭha, the pupils of Kiraṭa, lived in the Asura-maya.
3.168.4	They cooked rice on the fire and meat without fire.
3.168.5	They were the two who, having gone before, were the two who followed after. They were the two deceivers.
3.168.6	The Ikshvāku kings, having eaten the food of the Asuras, were defeated.
3.168.7	The oblations of the Gaupayanas burned the Rathprausthika Asamaati.
3.168.8	He said, "These two are the Kirāta-kula. These are the Ahuti-s of the Gaupayanas that are burning me."
3.168.9	They said, "We will do such a thing that these will not burn you."
3.168.10	Having gone to the sleeping Gāupāyana, the son of Subandhu, they took the Soma and placed it inside the enclosing sticks.
3.168.11	At that time the fires had enclosing sticks.
3.168.12	When Subandhu woke up, he understood what had happened and said, "They have taken the Soma of the Asuras."
3.168.13	They said, "Let us follow the Soma of Subandhu."
3.168.14	They went from Khandava.
3.168.15	Do not let us go from the path, O Indra, from the sacrifice of the Soma-presser.
3.168.16	Do not be hostile to us.
3.168.17	And whatever we have done here and whatever we have done at the sacrifice, from both of these may we not go away. They went to the Su-bandhu-navatantu-matīrtha, having crossed the Hṛṇīṇī river flowing towards the east, and reached the Asamāti river near Rāthaprauṣṭha.
3.169.1	There, not knowing the fire, they said, "The fire here is named Varūthyas."
3.169.2	Then Agni Varuntha, having gone forth, said: "I am named Varuntha."
3.169.3	"He who would please you, whatever you say to him, let him do that."
3.169.4	They approached him, saying: "O Agni, you are our last refuge, the protector, the auspicious, the shelter."
3.169.5	He said to them: "What is your desire in coming?"
3.169.6-13	The Asuras said, "Let us again enter Subandhu." He said, "This is the inner boundary." "Take it!" They called out to him. "This is your mother, this is your father, this is the one who came to life." "This is the way you move, Subandhu, come, go out!" Thus, the Asuras again entered Subandhu.
3.169.14	He became as he was before.
3.169.15	They are called the two Kirāta-brothers, because they were the sages who cried out.
3.169.16	They ran away, carrying them.
3.169.17	All the illusions fled from them, except these two.
3.169.18	The form of them which was the most sinful, that form remained.
3.170.1	Then, indeed, in the past, they were seen by means of magic.
3.170.2	One of them, floating over the fire, said: "He does thus, who seeks to injure truth with falsehood."
3.170.3	Then they made this agreement:
3.170.4	Then one of them, having approached, and cutting off the neck, said, "Thus indeed does he do who seeks to injure truth with falsehood."
3.170.5	They both became angry.
3.170.6	These are the verses that destroy enemies and demons.
3.170.7	He destroys the enemy, the wicked one, the demon, the evil one, by reciting these verses.
3.170.8	They say, "How can one recite these verses when the Valakhilyas are wandering?"
3.170.9	One should say, "It is because these verses have different syllables and different words."
3.171.1	In those (verses), there is a pause.
3.171.2	The gods and the Asuras contended for food.
3.171.3	The gods won the food of the Asuras.
3.171.4	Among them, the Asuras, there was a great food called Gūrd.
3.171.5	The gods desired, "We shall win this Gūrd food of the Asura."
3.171.6	They saw this Sama.
3.171.7	They praised with it.
3.171.8-13	He won the food of the Asuras. In that (food) he won. What he won, that is the winning of the food. This is the winning of food, the Sama. He who knows this wins food, seizes the food of his enemies.
3.171.14	All the gods were jealous of him, saying, "Mine, mine!"
3.171.15	That Agni desired, "May I conquer this food."
3.171.16	He saw this Sama.
3.171.17	He surrounded it with that.
3.171.18	He conquered it.
3.171.19	This is all the food in Agni.
3.171.20	Therefore, when they offer to any deity, they offer in the fire.
3.171.21	In that (fire) he roared.
3.171.22	What he roared, that is the roaring of the roaring.
3.171.23	This is the prosperity of food.
3.171.24	He who knows this obtains food, becomes the best among his kinsmen.
3.171.25	Which of these worlds does Indra and the All-gods support? They are the ones belonging to the All-gods.
3.171.26	The bull-goat is indeed belonging to the All gods.
3.171.27	This day is indeed belonging to All-gods. The All-gods are the gods of the sacrifice.
3.171.28	May Indra, with the Adityas, support our sacrifice, our body, and our progeny.
3.171.29	With the Adityas, Indra with his retinue, and the Maruts, may he bestow healing on us. Thus they perform the atonement with this.
3.172.1	Among them, the auspicious one of Gautam.
3.172.2	Gautama, desiring prosperity, practiced austerity.
3.172.3	He saw this Sama.
3.172.4	He praised with it.
3.172.5	Then he obtained prosperity.
3.172.6	That prosperity is indeed auspicious.
3.172.7	The progeny is good.
3.172.8	The progeny is better than the progeny.
3.172.9	One who knows this sees progeny for the progeny.
3.172.10	Because Gautam saw it, therefore it is called "good of Gautam".
3.172.11	"For Indra, the slayer of Vritra, we have sung" - the Vartraghna hymns are at the end for victory.
3.172.12	The gods, having conquered in six days, said, "What shall be the end of this, so that those who have conquered may not again be conquered by the Asuras?"
3.172.13	They removed the juices from the backs.
3.172.14	They struck them.
3.172.15	Then it rose up as a bamboo.
3.172.16	It became the Udvashi-bamboo.
3.172.17	That is the reason for the Udvamshiyas being Udvamshi.
3.172.18	It went beyond the sacrifice.
3.172.19	Therefore they expelled that son of Udvamshi,
3.172.20	from the very Rasa. They made him the last of the six days of the Prsthya, the Udvamshiya of the Chandomas.
3.172.21	These two raised thunderbolts stand at the end for the protection of the animals, for the preservation of the animals.
3.172.22	He whose wealth is not taken away by others, knows this.
3.172.23	This is the form, taste, and brilliance of all the backs.
3.172.24	In this entire form, taste, brilliance, and unconquered metre of the backs, they stand at the end of the sacrifice.
3.172.25	They offer the Pratihara (cup) in front of the Nidhana (cup).
3.172.26	The sacrificer is held by the Pratihara and the Prastara.
3.172.27	Now they have become as if past. In that they offer the Pratiharacup in front of the nidhana, it is for non-passing over.
3.172.28	It becomes the Svaracup.
3.172.29	It approaches the seventh day.
3.172.30	It becomes Svaracup. The Svaracup. It becomes Svaracup itself.
3.172.31	They attain it on the next day with Svaracup.
3.172.32	Just as one would pass from one body to another, just as one would join one breath with another.
3.173.1	Prajapati created this sacrifice, the twelve-day sacrifice.
3.173.2	He attained it all by means of the six days of the Prsthya (fortnight).
3.173.3	He thought, "How can I join these four days?"
3.173.4	He created the twenty-fourth day with the Gayatri, the forty-fourth with the Tristubh, the eighty-fourth with the Jagati, and the tenth day with the Anushtubh.
3.173.5	That by which he created all the days from the metres, that is the reason why the Chandomas are called Chandomas.
3.173.6	They say, "The Stotras are completed, the metres are completed, the deities are completed, the seasons are completed, the Grahas are completed, when this six-day Pañcavimśa is completed."
3.173.7	Now, why the twenty-fourth Bahispavamāna is performed on the seventh day, because the twenty-fourth half-month is the year.
3.174.2	This is the most desirable day.
3.174.3	"The word "pre" is the form of the Gayatri.
3.174.4	They go by the form of the Gāyatrī.
3.174.5	" "The god, the creator of the gods, the wise, Soma is the god, the creator, of the gods."
3.174.6	They generate Soma.
3.174.7	The food of the gods is called "Mahu", "Shuchi-bandhu", and "Pāvaka".
3.174.8	Soma is indeed the food of the gods.
3.174.9	They indeed generate him.
3.174.10	"The boar approaches with steps, with a roar", indeed, having become a boar, Prajapati passed from the sixth day to the seventh day.
3.174.11	This is indeed a transgression.
3.174.12	"The Brahmanas are the swans, the Triphalas, and the Vagus."
3.174.13	"The bulls have gone from the Ama to the Asti." The Ama is the six-day period, the Asti is the Chandomas.
3.174.14	The bulls are the Chandas.
3.174.15	They thus lead the Chandomas beyond the Chandas for the purpose of crossing over the last three days.
3.174.16-17	The Angosira, Pavamana, and the Sakhayo are mentioned together. The Bṛhadrathaṃtara is yoked at the morning pressing.
3.174.18	The cows, playing in vain, do not notice the gait of the great-going one. They become cows and cattle-possessors. For the securing of cattle.
3.174.19	For cattle are the metres.
3.174.20	He makes it a perfect enclosure, with sharp horns.
3.174.21	He says, 'perfect enclosure'. Perfect enclosure is food. For the securing food.
3.174.22	By day Hari is seen, at night Rjra. Thus the Atiratra is performed in form.
3.175.1	These are the verses: Triṣṭubh verses with the form of Gāyatrī, performed in the form of the day.
3.175.2	Where they are performed in the form and prosperity of the day, there they are accomplished.
3.175.3	He who knows this is accomplished.
3.175.4	They say, "Why is the seventh day Gāyatrī, the eighth Trisṭubh, and the ninth Jagatī? Why do they begin with Trisṭubh?"
3.175.5	He should say, "All these days are Trisṭubh in nature."
3.175.6	"Like chariots with their own wheels, they proceed."
3.175.7	This is the form of the Pravargya rite.
3.175.8	For this is the Pravargya day.
3.175.9	The Sūkta is the Anurūpa. The Sūkta is cattle.
3.175.10	The Chandomas are cattle. For the securing of cattle.
3.175.11	And cattle are the earth.
3.175.12	The Sûkta is the earth.
3.175.13	They make the cattle the Anurūpas of cattle.
3.175.14	Here they do not make them like the actual ones.
3.175.15	Therefore cattle produce offspring of various forms: the white one produces the black, the black one the white, the tawny one the dun, the dun the tawny.
3.175.16	The horses, the swift ones,
3.175.17	the Soma-drinkers have gone for the sake of wealth.
3.175.18	Thus they approach the form of the Pravargya rite.
3.175.19-24	This is the Pravargya day. "The verse, "Like chariots, they are being urged on," " "The verse "They have stretched out their arms, " "Like the bearers of burdens, " "The kings, with their praises, the Soma-pressers, with their cows, are shining. " Thus they become connected with cattle and animals. For the securing of cattle.
3.175.25	The animals are the metres.
3.175.26	"They approach the form of the seventh day with the verse, "The sacrifice is not sevenfold to the creators."
3.176.1	It consists of nine verses.
3.176.2	There are nine vital airs in man.
3.176.3	They proceed prospering by means of the vital airs, standing in the vital airs.
3.176.4	And they proceed by means of that very Trivrt stoma.
3.176.5	Whatever is the Prāyana, it is threefold.
3.176.6	The Prāyana itself becomes the nine-versed (verse).
3.176.7	They go forward, prospering with the Prāṇas.
3.176.8	"The verse, "May thy favour be mine," is a repetition for the stability of offspring and the presence of cattle.
3.176.9	They say that the grass is equal, where does the serpent go? Where does the penance exist?
3.176.10	They say that the birds fall down.
3.176.11	How do the wingless ones break?
3.176.12	Those who are similar in their intentions and similar in their rising are like birds.
3.176.13	These are the days of the bird. By these he flies up, by these he attains the thirty-three-fold Stoma.
3.176.14	He who knows thus overcomes evil by the bird, attains prosperity by the bird. The first is the cry of the bird, the last is the cry of man. Thus indeed is this day.
3.176.15	Therefore the bird is right, by the wings.
3.176.16-20	The Stoma is twenty-fourfold. The year consists of twenty-four half-months. They go forward in the year, established in the half-months. And the Gayatri has twenty-four syllables. The Gayatri is the brilliance, the Brahmic lustre. They go forward, established in brilliance, in Brahmic lustre.
3.177.1	The three Vaishvānara-extra-days are to be performed in the twelve-day sacrifice, they say.
3.177.2	The first Vaishvānaran is Prāṇa, the second Apāna, the third Vyāna.
3.177.3	This is the speech that is spread out, namely the twelve-day (sacrifice).
3.177.4	They may cut it off in you.
3.177.5	Harila Kahoda went to it after conquering the three armies.
3.177.6	Then a brahmin said to him, "Having performed the rites, he approached death.
3.177.7	He lost his speech."
3.177.8	His family was indeed cut off.
3.177.9	Aryala Kahoda went to him, having conquered the three armies.
3.177.10	Then a brahmin said, "Having performed rites, he approached his death.
3.177.11	He had lost his speech."
3.177.12	His family was indeed cut off.
3.177.13	But he did live on.
3.177.14	But later he made it up to him.
3.177.15	"The head of heaven, the desire of earth," - thus one should make the Vaisvānara (fire) in the form of the sun.
3.177.16	"One does not cut off speech, one does not go beyond the Vaisvânara fire."
3.177.17	"O ye, do ye carry forth to the bright-rayed one," - thus one makes the Pravartî (verse).
3.177.18	This is the day of the Praṇīṣeṇya (Sāman).
3.177.19	The word 'pra' is the form of the Gāyatrī.
3.177.20	They go by the form of the Gayatri.
3.177.21	More forms are to be performed.
3.177.22	The other forms are more.
3.177.23	When he says, "The head of heaven, the delight of earth," he means to say, "The Atiratra of heaven and earth." It is indeed in this form that the Atiratra is performed.
3.177.24	"Vaisvânara, born in truth," he says; Agni Vaisvânara becomes manifest.
3.177.25	"The wise, the sovereign, the guest of men," he says; this is the midday pressing.
3.177.26	The gods, having approached, produced the vessel. Thus is the third pressing of the sixth day. They approach it.
3.178.1	For that is the last pressing in the sacrifice which the gods saw.
3.178.2	Now they have passed by.
3.178.3	They approach it for continuity.
3.178.4	The gods said, "These two Atirātras are the two Atrins. By what form of Agni Vaisvānara shall we pass through them?"
3.178.5	They said, "We shall pass through those forms of ours which are the last, the most excellent, the most secret."
3.178.6	The head is the highest and most secret form of heaven and earth.
3.178.7	Vaisvānara Agni, born in truth, is the highest and secret form of Agni Vaisvānara.
3.178.8	The verse "Vaisvānara, born of truth, Agni" is the most secret and supreme form of Agni Vaisvānara.
3.178.9	The verse "The sage, the sovereign, the guest of men" is the most hidden and supreme form of Indra, the sovereign, among the Vatis.
3.178.10	The gods, who are near, generate the vessel. This is the last and most secret form of all the gods.
3.179.1	Just as a person who is pleased with his seed wears his clothes, so he wears the clothes that are the forms of the gods. In the same way, the gods, with their last and most secret forms, spread the form of Agni Vaisvānara.
3.179.2	So it is now.
3.179.3	All the Agniṣṭoma rites are completed.
3.179.4	Six hymns go out.
3.179.5	They go out in this sixth day.
3.179.6	They are again yoked in this very Agni-offering.
3.179.7	The head of heaven, the desire of earth. Thus he is yoked to the heaven and earth.
3.179.8	Vaisvānara. Thus he is joined to the Vaisvānara (fire).
3.179.9	The born Agni of truth. Thus he is united to the Jātavedas (fire).
3.179.10	These are joined in the Marutvatīya Niskavalyā, "The poet, the king, the guest of men."
3.179.11	These are joined in the Ajyapuruṣa, "The gods generate the vessel near."
3.179.12	Thus these hymns are again joined.
3.179.13	For this three-day (rite) is indeed short.
3.179.14	Therefore it is said, "The head of heaven, the delight of earth."
3.179.15	This is indeed the head of heaven, and the delight of earth.
3.180.1	"You sing to Mitra," it says. This is the Maitrāvaruṇa.
3.180.2	They approach the form of the Pravargya.
3.180.3	For this is the Pravargya day.
3.180.4	The Samrāṭ is born of ghee, Mitra and Varuna are both, and the two approach the form of the Brihat and Rathantara.
3.180.5	Both the Brihat and the Rathantara are performed here.
3.180.6	"O Indra, come, O Indra, come, with variegated light, O Indra, with the desire to come, O Indra come, come, come."
3.180.7	Come, come, come! Thus they proceed in front of the yoked ones.
3.180.8	Just as one would proceed in front of yoked ones, saying, "Come, come!" so is the third day, the Indra-Agni (day).
3.180.9	The Indra-Agni day has butter offerings.
3.180.10	The Sattra is like two villages with different boundaries, namely the six-day Prsthya and the Chandomas.
3.180.11	Just as a village has many friends, so that it may be safe from danger, so also the offerings of clarified butter are different.
3.180.12	Some perform them in an uneven manner.
3.180.13	Therefore they should be performed in an even manner.
3.180.14	The Stoma is twenty-fourfold. The year consists of twenty-four half-months. They go forward in the year, established in the half-months.
3.180.15	And the Gāyatrī has twenty-four syllables.
3.180.16	The Gāyatrī is brilliance and spiritual splendour.
3.180.17	They go forward, established in brilliance and spiritual splendour.
3.181.1	Now those stomas which are odd, they are even; and those which are even, they are odd.
3.181.2	Those stomas which are even, the domestic animals follow them; and those which odd, the wild ones.
3.181.3	And because the Saman of the odd stomas is the last even one, therefore the domestic animals draw yoked.
3.181.4	Now, because the Sāman is the highest of the Stotras, therefore the wild animals move in pairs.
3.181.5	And because on the tenth day the Stotras are fifteen and thirty-three, therefore the two best animals, the elephant and the camel, move in pairs.
3.182.1	"O Bull, do thou flow on, O Holder" (are the verses) of the Madhyandina Pavamana. The verses of the Madhyandin Pavamana are in the Gayatra metre. They have the form of the Brihatis.
3.182.2	This is the Bharata day.
3.182.3	"To the Maruts and to Matasara" (are the Madhyandina verses). The verses of the Marutvatis are in the Jagati metre.
3.182.4	The form of the Madhyandinas is that of the Maruts.
3.182.5	They do not go beyond the form of the Madhynas.
3.182.6	That you are the supporter of the two worlds, as if it were the seventh day that had fallen away.
3.182.7	And because he says, "You are the supporter," it is for Agni's support.
3.182.8	The Gāyatrī verse in them is explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.182.9	Now the Sāntani.
3.182.10	Just as the sky is cut off and falls away, so the sixth and seventh days are cut off and fall away.
3.182.11	Just as one would join a horse to a yoke, so here (the Hotr) joins the continuity.
3.182.12	He recites it once, responds thrice, and concludes thrice.
3.182.13	It becomes seven, the form of the seventh day, for the continuity of the seven-day (rite) without interruption.
3.182.14	Then the Sauparna Brāhmaṇa, which has been spoken.
3.182.15	The sacrifice has now passed beyond the seventh day.
3.182.16	Now, what is here as Sauparna is for the commencement of the sacrifice.
3.182.17	It is Ida, for cattle are Ida.
3.182.18	Cattle are the Chandomas, for the securing of cattle.
3.183.1	Now, the Rohitakuliya.
3.183.2	Visvamitra, the son of Bharata, went to the great bull of Anasvatya.
3.183.3	He came to a great obstacle on the Ganga or the Yamuna.
3.183.4	They said, "Who are these two bulls that can pull such a huge cart?"
3.183.5	Visvamitra said, "They are my two red bulls."
3.183.6	Those two bulls were red.
3.183.7	They said, "We will take the share of the great bulls. If they are taken away by the bulls, you will fill the mouths of the bulls with grass."
3.183.8	"If they are taken away, we will conquer you."
3.183.9	"So be it."
3.183.10	They took the share.
3.183.11	They yoked them to the yoke of barley or rice.
3.183.12	He desired, 'May I win this race.'
3.183.13	He saw these two Sāmans.
3.183.14	He practised them by going around them.
3.183.15	They crossed over them.
3.183.16	They won them.
3.183.17	Then he won that race.
3.183.18	Those who go beyond the sixth day, they go against the stream.
3.183.19	Now, that which is the Rohitika-Kuliya (Sāman), it is indeed Ujjitiya.
3.183.20	He who knows this, indeed, prospers.
3.183.21	This is indeed the Kamasani (Sāman).
3.183.22	He indeed desired this (Sāman) for his desire.
3.183.23	His desire was fulfilled.
3.183.24	He, for whom one recites this Sāman, his desire is fulfilled.
3.184.2-7	The gods, in the battle with the Asuras, hurled these weapons which were inexhaustible. Agni hurled the Raurava. He scorched the Asuras with it. They, being scorched, cried out. Because they cried out when being scorched, that is the reason for the name Raurava. He who knows this becomes superior to his enemy and burns him.
3.184.8-13	This is the Agniya (rite) performed on the Agniya day. This day is Agniya because it is Gayatri. For Agni is Gayatri. The Raurava rite performed here is in the form of the day itself. By this prosperity they make it prosperous for them in their own community. This is the Ida rite. Ida is cattle.
3.184.14	The animals are the metres; for the purpose of securing the animals.
3.184.15	Then the Rathantara.
3.184.16	They say that the twelfth day is the Jama.
3.184.17	The sixth day is the Bharata, the seventh day is the Bharada.
3.184.18	They recite the Rathantara in the Pavamana; for the purpose that it may not be the Jama.
3.184.19	They say, "It is not taken away from elsewhere, it is taken away as a separate thing."
3.184.20	Now, since both the Brihat and the Rathantara are (used), it is for the sake of variety.
3.184.21	He who wishes to move from the root to the top is not able to do so, but he who moves from the top to the top is able to do so.
3.184.22	Those who perform the Brihat after the Brihat move from the top to top.
3.184.23	Therefore the sixth day is Barhaspatya, the seventh is Barhaspatyam.
3.185.1	Then the Gaungavam, the praise of the deity in the Sama.
3.185.2	This Sama praises the deity, thereby the sacrificers become true in their wishes.
3.185.3	The gods and the Asuras were contending for cattle.
3.185.4	The Asuras, together with the cattle, entered the ocean.
3.185.5	The gods desired, "Let us win the cattle of the Asuras."
3.185.6	They saw this Sama.
3.185.7	They praised with it.
3.185.8	With it they won the cattle of the demons.
3.185.9	They said, "We have won the cattle of Asuras."
3.185.10	That is the reason for the name Gauṅgava.
3.185.11	This Sama is for winning cattle.
3.185.12	He who knows this, by means of the Ganga, takes away the cattle of his hateful enemy and wins cattle. He becomes one with many cattle.
3.185.13	By means of the Ganga the gods, having slain the Asuras, made the cattle cry.
3.185.14	That is the reason why it is called Ganga.
3.185.15	It is indeed the destroyer of enemies.
3.185.16	He who knows this destroys his hateful enemy.
3.185.17	And it is sung as if above and as if across.
3.185.18	What is sung as if upward is the form of the Brihat, what is sung as if across is the form of Rathantara.
3.185.19	This is indeed the complete form of the Chandomas, that both forms.
3.186.1	Now about the complete.
3.186.2	Indra and Agni desired, "May we be complete, may we attain complete prosperity."
3.186.3	They saw this Sama.
3.186.4	One saw half, the other saw half.
3.186.5	Having brought together the ends of it, he made it whole.
3.186.6	What he made whole, that is the wholeness of Samanta.
3.186.7	By that they became whole.
3.186.8	Then indeed they became whole, they attained the whole prosperity.
3.186.9	That is Brahman, Agni, the nobility, Indra.
3.186.10	He who knows this, obtains both Brahman and Kshatra.
3.186.11	Therefore, this is the Sama Veda, and from this day there is no obstruction.
3.186.12	This is the Rathantara, and this is the Brihat.
3.186.13	This is indeed the space, the all-encompassing. For the all-encompaasssing of these two worlds.
3.186.14	These two are indeed all-encompasing.
3.186.15	One desiring cattle should chant with this.
3.186.16	The animals are the atmosphere, the animals are all around.
3.186.17	One becomes possessed of animals, one who praises all around.
3.186.18	A brahmin who desires to be a priest should praise all around.
3.186.19	Agni is the brahmin, Indra is the king, Agni is the earth, Indra is the sky.
3.186.20	These are all around the atmosphere.
3.186.21	He makes them both complete, the Brahman and the Kshatriya. He goes on praising them completely. He makes them complete.
3.186.22	Prajapati desired, "May I be complete with offspring and cattle."
3.186.23	He saw this Sama.
3.186.24	He praised with it. Then indeed he became complete with offspring and with cattle.
3.186.25	That itself is the completeness of the complete.
3.186.26	He who knows this becomes prosperous in every way with offspring and cattle.
3.187.1	Now the Barhaspatya Atharva-Nara.
3.187.2	Both castes for prosperity.
3.187.3	The middle one for stability.
3.187.4	The Adityas and the Angirasas competed for the heavenly world.
3.187.5	They thought, "Whoever will officiate for us, they will be victorious."
3.187.6	They, the Angiras, first performed the sacrifice. They sent Agni Angiras as their messenger to the Sun-god, saying, "Tell us about the Sun-god."
3.187.7	He came and said, "The Adityas told the Angiras about the Sun-gods."
3.187.8	They said to him, "Go away. We will consult and then tell you."
3.187.9	That is why even today they say to a messenger, "Go away, we will consult and then inform you."
3.187.10	They said, "Find out how the Angirasas may worship us and we may not worship the Angirasas.
3.187.11	If we were to perform the sacrifice, we would be happy; if we were not to perform the sacrifice we would be deprived of the glory of the sacrifice.'
3.187.12	Therefore, one should not depart from the sacrifice, lest one be deprived of the fame of the sacrifice.
3.188.1	One should not depart from it.
3.188.2	One should either return to one's own sacrifice or say, 'This has been done by you.'
3.188.3	They, the Adityas, performed this sacrifice of immediate effect.
3.188.4	They said, "O Agni, it is a long time since we have told you about this Soma-sacrifice today."
3.188.5	They chose Agni as their Hotṛ, Gauram Angiras as their Adhvaryu, Brihaspati as their Udgātṛ, and Ayasya as their Brahman. All of them chose.
3.188.6	He said, "I am the messenger."
3.188.7	They chose Agni as the messenger, and he went as the messenger.
3.188.8	Having been chosen, he did not leave them.
3.188.9	He returned and said, "The Angiras have told you today that the Adityas are your sons."
3.188.10	They said, "Let it be so."
3.188.11	He said, "No."
3.188.12	"You were my messengers, but now I am their messenger. Surely, they are more intelligent and wiser than you, for they saw this before you."
3.188.13	They were surrounded and did not flee.
3.188.14	They came and performed the sacrifice.
3.188.15	To them the Adityas gave the horse, which was white and was called 'horse'. The Brahman, having taken the horse, went to heaven.
3.188.16	The Angiras became inferior.
3.188.17	That Ayasya, having taken a horse similar to himself or superior to himself, went away.
3.188.18	He desired: "May I unite with myself."
3.188.19	He saw this Sama.
3.188.20	With it he united himself.
3.188.21	The seventh day is like a fallen one.
3.188.22	Whatever one does on that day, one unites oneself with it, one heals oneself with it.
3.188.23	Because he saw the fallen one, therefore it is called the fallen one.
3.188.24	The verse "Indra has gone to the abode of Indra" and the Saman "Pravad" are employed in this day.
3.188.25	Both the colours are employed for prosperity.
3.188.26	The Bhrigus, the Angirasas, and the Adityas ascended to heaven by "Pra."
3.188.27	They ascend to heaven by this (verse).
3.189.1	Then the Brihat (Saman).
3.189.2	The Brihat is the height.
3.189.3	They go to the height, indeed, having been established.
3.189.4	It is on the Gayatri day.
3.189.5	This is the form of the male, indeed, the Brihat, and the female, the Gayatri.
3.189.6	Therefore, the Brihat is the rear (hymn) here. By that, this day is made a pair.
3.189.7	Then the Vamadevya.
3.189.8	The Vamadevya is for cattle.
3.189.9	By means of this one praises, they become possessed of cattle.
3.189.10	"They step on the Brihatis with "We are indeed your sons.", for non-deterioration.
3.189.11	In them, the Kanva is the final verse.
3.189.12	They say, "This is contradictory to the Brahmanical verse, that one speaks another form."
3.189.13	Now, when it is said, "That which is beyond," then they do not go beyond the form of Rathantara.
3.189.14	Indra indeed desired to slay Vritra.
3.189.15	He approached Kanva, saying, "O sage, we shall run to you. Please instruct us here."
3.189.16	Kanva saw this Sama.
3.189.17	He praised with it.
3.189.18	Then Indra slew Vritra.
3.189.19	He who knows this destroys his enemies.
3.189.20	And because Kâṇva struck with this hymn, the thunderbolt, therefore it is called Abhinidhâna-Kâṇva.
3.189.21	And these are the verses: 'No one can injure him by his deeds.'
3.189.22	The Brihatī indeed exceeds the Jagatī, the Kakup the Kakubha, the Anushtubh the Anushtubha.
3.189.23	This is the Brihatī, and it becomes the Jagatī.
3.189.24	Therefore he exceeds.
3.189.25	It exceeds the eighth day, and begins the ninth day, and runs back to the sixth day.
3.190.1	In them is the Vaikhanasa.
3.190.2	The Vaikhanasas, seeing these obstacles to the beginning of the sacrifice, removed them.
3.190.3	The gods, by means of obstacles, prevented the Asuras from interfering with the sacrifice.
3.190.4	Then indeed the Vaikhanasas were the beloved of Indra.
3.190.5	Then indeed Marilāva, the secret one, killed them.
3.190.6	He, desiring to approach the secret one, went to him.
3.190.7	He said to him, "You have not seen the sages called Vaikhānasas."
3.190.8	He said, "O revered one, he killed them."
3.190.9	He said to him, "The crime of killing a fetus is difficult to promise to bear.
3.190.10	How can one promise to bear it?"
3.190.11	He said, "One should promise to bear the killing of a fetus and the sin of lying.
3.190.12	That was indeed untrue.
3.190.13	He came to the truth.
3.190.14	He said to him, "Choose a boon, whoever you are."
3.190.15	He said, "Let a Brahman be born in my family."
3.190.16	These are the Takshas, the Rahasyas.
3.190.17	Then they say, he praised Indra as the deity, and saw Indra in himself. "The sting of your stinginess has been removed."
3.190.18	He desired, "May I unite them."
3.190.19	He saw this Sama.
3.190.20	With that he united them.
3.190.21	This is the remedy, the atonement, the Sama.
3.190.22	The medicine is the expiation.
3.190.23	The seventh day is like a fallen one.
3.190.24	They heal it with this.
3.190.25	They perform the expiation with this as medicine.
3.190.26	It is indeed for the sake of desire.
3.190.27	He desired this desire.
3.190.28	That desire was accomplished for him.
3.190.29	Whatever desire one may have when one praises with this Sama, that desire is fulfilled for him.
3.190.30	This indeed was seen by Indra.
3.190.31	Because Indra saw this Sama, it is called Vaikhanasa.
3.190.32	This is the Sama of the Acchhavasas.
3.190.33	Idā means cattle.
3.190.34	They indeed establish themselves in cattle.
3.191.1	The Madhu is the best of thy Madhus, the Pavamana of the morning pressing. The Gāyatrī verses are Madhu-like.
3.191.2	The juice is the Madhu.
3.191.3	This is like a daughter, namely the third pressing.
3.191.4	And in that they are Madhu- like, they put juice into it, and thus they make it grow.
3.191.5	"Therefore do thou flow, O Andhasu," the verses are Andhasu-like; Andhasu means food; for the securing of food.
3.191.6	"He smote Vritra, the enemy," is the Bharata form.
3.191.7	What is above midday, that is the Bharata part of this day.
3.191.8	"The tawny one, the companion, with the well-standing cows,"
3.191.9	This day is indeed lost, which is the seventh.
3.191.10	And because it is said, "With those who are well-established," it is for the establishment of the day.
3.191.11	Among them, the Gayatri is mentioned in the Brahmana.
3.191.12	Now, the Agniarka is the Sama of Agni, performed on the Agnihaya day.
3.191.13	This day is indeed Agnihaya, which is Gayatri.
3.191.14	For Agni is Gayatri.
3.191.15	Now, the Arka of Agni here is indeed the day itself. They prosper in its form.
3.191.16	By that prosperity, they prosper in their own community.
3.191.17	And also, the Arka is indeed food. It is for the securing of food.
3.191.18	Now, the Soma-sāman.
3.191.19	Soma indeed is procreation.
3.191.20	This day is indeed procreation.
3.191.21	This is indeed the generation of generation.
3.191.22	Soma is indeed the Kshatriya.
3.191.23	The Kshatriya is indeed the giver of food.
3.191.24	He who is the giver of food, he gives us food.
3.191.25	It becomes half-verse. The Iḍā is indeed the animals.
3.191.26	The animals are the Chandomas. For the securing of animals.
3.192.1	Now the Dakshoṇi-dhanam.
3.192.2	This day, the seventh, is as if lost.
3.192.3	They restore it with the Dakshoņidhānam.
3.192.4	Prajapati created beings.
3.192.5	They were born without breath.
3.192.6	He desired, "May these beings of mine be endowed with breath."
3.192.7	He saw this Sama.
3.192.8	He then recited the verse, "To Daksha, to him."
3.192.9	Dakshas are the vital airs.
3.192.10	He indeed placed them in the vital airs. He indeed placed them in himself and the sacrificer.
3.192.11	He who knows this places the vital airs in himself and the Sacrificer.
3.192.12	Sudakshina Kshaimir said, "They know the churning in your family, but they do not know the wealth of Dakshina. They have made it in the mouth of Pavamana."
3.192.13	What is the story?
3.192.14	Because they do not find churning in your family.
3.192.15	Therefore, the Sun should be offered to Agni first.
3.192.16	This is the Sāman of the Sāman-chanting. The Sāman-verse of the Sāntanika is the remedy for this day.
3.192.17	This day is like a fallen one, because it is the seventh.
3.192.18	They remedy it with the Sāman verse of the Sāntaṇika.
3.192.19	The most intoxicating one flows with the streams.
3.192.20	Playing with the waves like the waters.
3.192.21	Thus indeed, at this time, Kakup (the Kakubha metre) passes over Kakubha (the Kakubh metre), Anushtubh (the Anushtubh metre) passes over Anushtubh.
3.192.22	This Kakup, being true, becomes Trishtup.
3.192.23	By that he passes over.
3.192.24	He begins with the eighth day.
3.192.25	He who with force cut the stone, which was inside the stone, and which was like a sheep.
3.192.26	Go forth, O Indra, to the cattle, to the horses, to the wealth, like a warrior to his prey.
3.192.27	Thus they are connected with cattle and animals, for the securing of cattle.
3.192.28	For cattle are the metres.
3.193.1	In them Indra was praised by all beings.
3.193.2	But Sharka did not desire to praise him.
3.193.3	He said to him, "Praise me."
3.193.4	He said, "I will not praise you."
3.193.5	"I am in the ocean, in the waters, I am sinking down. I will praise you only this much."
3.193.6	Parjanya, with the rain, flooded him upwards with arrows.
3.193.7	He showed him the waters.
3.193.8	He dried him up with the wind from the north.
3.193.9	He knew that he was lying dried up, and said, "What have I done that Indra has done this to me? I shall praise him."
3.193.10	"He will certainly flood me again."
3.193.11	He saw this mantra.
3.193.12	He praised him with it.
3.193.13	He who in the past brought this and that to us, to him I praise.
3.193.14	Indra, for help, with his friends.
3.193.15	Thus.
3.193.16	He said, "For what purpose do you praise me?"
3.193.17	He said, "May I again be immersed in this ocean."
3.193.18	Parjanya again immersed the ocean with rain.
3.193.19	This is the remedy, the atonement, the Sama Veda.
3.194.2-8	That very one is the sand that rises. That is his heavenly (verse). He who knows this attains the heavenly world. The Chandomas are indeed the ocean. The shark is indeed capable of crossing the ocean. That which is here the sand is for crossing the ocean. It is again the low-rising verse.
3.194.9	Wherever the gods found the essence of the metres, they made it again and again, they struck it again and again.
3.194.10	These metres are like daughters, having their abode in the third pressing.
3.194.11	The third pressing is like a daughter.
3.194.12	And when the metre is made again and again, it is the essence that they put into the metres.
3.194.13	This is the continuation of the same Rasa.
3.194.14	It becomes the Kakubha Svaram.
3.194.15	Svaram is indeed the breath, Kakup is the Purusha.
3.194.16	The breath is the eldest, the Purusha is the eldest.
3.194.17	He indeed establishes the eldest by the eldest, he stands by the eldest.
3.194.18	The reason why it is called "Sarkara" is that the fish Sarkara saw it.
3.194.19	"Come and sit down, O friends, to the one who purifies, to the one for whom they sing." They become many.
3.194.20	They approach the form of the Pravargya.
3.194.21	For this is the Pravargya day.
3.194.22	The child is not adorned with sacrifices, O prosperity. Thus they approach the form of cattle.
3.194.23	The child is indeed a cattle.
3.195.1	Among them, the raft.
3.195.2	He who bathes in the ocean without a raft does not enjoy it, but he who bathes with a raft enjoys it.
3.195.3	The ocean is indeed the Chandomas.
3.195.4	Therefore, the raft is indeed the raft of the Chandomas.
3.195.5	The gods, desiring heaven, practised austerities.
3.195.6	They saw this Sama.
3.195.7	They praised with it.
3.195.8	It carried them to heaven, becoming a raft.
3.195.9	Having gone to the heavenly world, they said, "This Sama has carried us to the heavenly world becoming a raft."
3.195.10	That is the raft-like nature of the raft.
3.195.11	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.195.12	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.195.13	This is indeed called Vasishtha's Plough.
3.195.14	Vasishtha desired, "May I cross all these worlds safely."
3.195.15	He saw this Sama.
3.195.16	He praised with it.
3.195.17	Then he indeed crossed all these worlds safely.
3.195.18	That is the floating of the floating.
3.195.19	He who knows this floats over all these worlds safely.
3.195.20	The sages praised Vasishtha, saying, "He is a vaishya, not a brahmana."
3.195.21	He desired, "May I cross over this evil, this sin."
3.195.22	He saw this Sama Veda.
3.195.23	He praised with it.
3.195.24	He crosses all the evils by that. Thus he crosses the evil, the sin.
3.195.25	He who knows this crosses the evil, sin.
3.195.26	It has twelve syllables and a Ni-dhanā. The Jagatī has twelve syllables.
3.195.27	The Jagatī is the animals.
3.195.28	The animals are the Chandomas. For the securing of animals.
3.195.29	Because Vasishtha saw it, therefore it is called the Vasishtha's raft.
3.195.30	These are the verses: "Purujiti vo andhasah" (RV 10.9.1).
3.195.31	They conquer evil in front, they go conquering evil in front.
3.195.32	Those who have conquered follow them.
3.195.33	Now, just as one would worship two new wheels, so they remove this Anushtubh verse in the three-day-long rites for the attainment of the heavenly world.
3.195.34	In them, the story of the cow is mentioned in the Brahmanas.
3.196.1	Now, about the Kritavesha.
3.196.2	The kingdom was divided into three parts among the Bharatas, the Vaitehavya, the Maitra, and the Kritavesa.
3.196.3	He desired, "May the two kingdoms be one kingdom, with the same name."
3.196.4	He saw this Sama Veda with two endings.
3.196.5	He praised with it.
3.196.6	With it, the two kingdoms became one kingdom with the same name.
3.196.7	This is the Sama Veda of prosperity, destroying enemies.
3.196.8	One who knows this attains prosperity and destroys the enemy.
3.196.9	Because he saw it in the form of a garment, therefore it is called Kārti-vesa.
3.196.10	Then the Svara-ga hymn, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
3.196.11	Then the An-dhi-ga hymn, with the Anushtubh metre, for the Anushtubha metre is not the Anushtubb. If they were to do this here,
3.196.12	then cattle are indeed the Anushtubba.
3.196.13	The animals are the metres; for the securing of animals.
3.196.14	Now these are the two-footed verses, with the Brahmanas mentioned.
3.196.15	They are these: 'Pravajy aksar' (the first verse) and so on. They are the verses of Pravajy.
3.196.16	They approach the form of the Prayaniya (rite).
3.196.17	For this is the Prayaniya day.
3.196.18	In them there is the Sauhaviṣa (verse).
3.196.19	The gods, having slain the Asuras, thought themselves impure and unclean.
3.196.20	They desired: "May we be pure and clean."
3.196.21	They saw this Sama.
3.196.22	They praised with it.
3.196.23	Then indeed they became pure and clean.
3.196.24	They said: "We have become good at sacrifice."
3.196.25	That is the reason for the name Sauhaviṣa.
3.196.26	He who knows this becomes pure and clean.
3.196.27	Those Soma-pressings are the highest, for now the sacrifice has gone to the highest.
3.197.1	Among them, the Jarabodhiya.
3.197.2	The Shakyas, with their quick oblations, were performing a sacrifice.
3.197.3	Shaktya Gauriviti killed a deer.
3.197.4	Tarkshya Suparna swooped down from above.
3.197.5	From that he placed it below.
3.197.6	He said to him, "Do not be angry with me."
3.197.7	"Whatever desire you have, I will fulfill it for you."
3.197.8	"What desire do I have?" he said.
3.197.9	"You desire the daughter of Asita Dhamanyu."
3.197.10	"I will give her to you."
3.197.11	Then Asita Dhamanyus became jealous.
3.197.12	His house was in the sky.
3.197.13	They were ashamed of him.
3.197.14	He used to hide her in a bamboo-pipe and send her to her lover. He used to wake her up in the morning with the same song, "O lover, wake up."
3.197.15	This is how the name Jarābodhīya came to be given to him.
3.197.16	This girl conceived.
3.197.17	A son was born to her.
3.197.18	The Asuras, having cut him off, went away, saying, "This is the embryo of a son of a slave, or a demon."
3.197.19	He desired, "I would bring him back."
3.197.20	He saw this Sama.
3.197.21	With it he brought him back.
3.197.22	He became the very same Samkriti, the cow-herd.
3.197.23	This is the remedy, the expiation, the Sama.
3.197.24	That is the medicine, that is the atonement.
3.197.25	The seventh day is like a fallen one.
3.197.26	They heal it with this.
3.197.27	They perform the atonement with this as medicine.
3.197.28	It is indeed the fulfillment of desire.
3.197.29	He desired this desire.
3.197.30	That desire was fulfilled for him.
3.197.31	Whatever desire one may have when one praises with this Sama, that desire is fulfilled for him.
3.197.32	They offer the Ida to him in the east.
3.197.33	The Ida is indeed cattle.
3.197.34	The Chandomas are cattle.
3.197.35	They indeed place the semen in cattle.
3.198.1	Then the Yagyayajniya, whose Brāhmaṇa is stated.
3.198.2	"O thy calf, may my mind come to thee." They become the Avatis.
3.198.3	The Ukthas are as if the severed part of the sacrificial rite.
3.198.4	When they are sung in the descending order, it is for the sake of the uniformity of the sacrifice.
3.198.5	In them is the Vatsa.
3.198.6	Vatsa Kanva, desiring cattle, practised austerity.
3.198.7	He saw this Sama.
3.198.8	He praised with it.
3.198.9	He indeed is Triśoka, because he removed those three sorrows. That is why he is called Triśoka.
3.198.10	He indeed obtained the animals with hair and ears immediately.
3.198.11	This is the animal-winning Sāman.
3.198.12	One who knows this obtains animals and becomes one with many animals.
3.198.13	Or because Vatsa Kaṇva saw it, therefore it is called Vatsa.
3.198.14	"Thou art Indra, O bearer of the burden," here the word "thou" is in the form of the Brihatī.
3.198.15	This is the Brhatī day.
3.198.16	O Indra, the hundred-armed, the all-powerful,
3.198.17	the hero who conquers the enemies.
3.198.18	What is a hundredfold or a thousandfold, that is the form of the Chandomas.
3.198.19	The Chandomas are cattle.
3.199.1	Among them, Sauśravasa.
3.199.2	Now, indeed, Kutsa was created on Indra's chest.
3.199.3	Just as Indra is, so he was created as his own self.
3.199.4	He made him the collector.
3.199.5	He was seized by his wife, by Shachi, by Paulomi.
3.199.6	He said, "What did you do?" She said, "I did not know."
3.199.7	She said,
3.199.8	He said, "I will make him a fool. Let him know thus."
3.199.9	He made him a fool.
3.199.10	Having removed his turban, he lay down.
3.199.11	This is the turban of the one who is to be bound.
3.199.12	He seized him by the turban.
3.199.13	He said to him, "How did you do this?"
3.199.14	She said, "I did not know that you had put on the turban and then put me down."
3.199.15	He said, "I shall put the dust on his shoulders, then you will know."
3.199.16	He put the dust on the shoulders of the one who was lying down.
3.199.17	These are the dusts on the shoulders of one who is being bound.
3.199.18	He put them on and then lay down.
3.199.19	He indeed grasped her.
3.199.20	He said to her, "How did you do this?"
3.199.21	She said, "I did not know you."
3.199.22	"I covered myself and lay down," (she said).
3.200.1	He obstructed her, saying, "You are a wrestler."
3.200.2	He said, "O Maghavan, let me go.
3.200.3	You give us that by which we live.
3.200.4	We are born from you.
3.200.5	"He said, 'Do you remove the dust from between your shoulders.'
3.200.6	He removed it.
3.200.7	The great country called Rajas and Rajiyasa arose among them.
3.200.8	Among them was a king.
3.200.9	His priest was Upgu Sauśravasa.
3.200.10	He said, 'Let no one sacrifice.
3.200.11	He who sacrifices to me in the Isha (sacrifice) is superior.
3.200.12	The gods do not eat the oblation that is not offered.
3.200.13	One should not offer a leaf-oblation.
3.200.14	He went to Indra and Sūshravā and said, "Sacrifice for me."
3.200.15	He said, "They do not sacrifice here."
3.200.16	"He who sacrifices here will be defeated."
3.200.17	He showed him the world after world, saying, "By sacrificing in this world, one conquers."
3.200.18-26	He (the sacrificer) made him (the priest) perform the sacrifice, though he was not a winner. "He said, "Let me sacrifice." He made him perform the sacrifice. They themselves stood up at the Sadas and the Havirdhāna. He sprinkled Soma on the mortar. He said, "You have come here from Kutsa." He went to Kutsa himself. He said to him, "Who did you sacrifice for?"
3.201.7	He showed him the world, saying, "He who sacrifices to this world conquers this world."
3.201.8	He thought, "Let me sacrifice to that world."
3.201.9	He said, "Sacrifice for me."
3.201.10	He sacrificed for him.
3.201.11	They themselves stood at the sacrificial post and the Soma-press, and pressed the Soma.
3.201.12	He said, "Who sacrificed?"
3.201.13	"He did so."
3.201.14	He himself got up and threw it into the water.
3.202.1	His father, Susravasthurayan, understood that Kutsa of Aurva had thrown his son into the water. He said:
3.202.2	"Where did you throw my son?"
3.202.3	"He is lying scattered in the water."
3.202.4	He then approached him.
3.202.5	Indra, having become a red (deer), let loose Soma from his mouth.
3.202.6	He thought, "This indeed is Indra."
3.202.7	"This alone is to be praised."
3.202.8	"This one alone will make me happy."
3.202.9	He saw this Sama.
3.202.10	He praised him with that.
3.202.11-18	The Indra who is the lord of the Soma, the Indra who is the head of the barley, the Indra who is the Indra, he said, "For what purpose do you praise me?" He said, "May this son of mine be united." He said, "Let him be united." He united him. He united him. This is the remedy, the atonement, the Sama.
3.202.19	That is the medicine, that is the atonement.
3.202.20	The seventh day is like a fallen one.
3.202.21	They heal it with this.
3.202.22	They perform the atonement with this as medicine.
3.202.23	It is indeed the fulfillment of desire.
3.202.24	He desired this desire.
3.202.25	That desire was fulfilled for him.
3.202.26	Whatever desire one may have, if one praises with this Sama, that desire is fulfilled.
3.202.27	Because Sushrava Stautayan saw it, therefore it is called Saurashtra.
3.203.1	The sages, having risen from the sacrifice, went to Ayuna,
3.203.2	They said, "Let us see some kind of Yakshas."
3.203.3	They said, "This Kashyapa is a great Yaksha in the ocean, without a boat.
3.203.4	Let us see him."
3.203.5	They followed him.
3.203.6	He appeared to them in a boat.
3.203.7	They said, "Let us praise Indra, he alone will show us."
3.203.8	He alone will show us this."
3.203.9	They said to Atri, "O sage, you praise."
3.203.10	He saw this three-verse hymn here.
3.203.11	He approached him with it.
3.203.12	"O Indra, whatever is not here for me, O you who give gifts, O you who are not to be defeated,
3.203.13	That boon you know, O Vasu, give it to us both."
3.203.14	Thus (he said).
3.203.15	He thought: "The sages are asking for a great boon.
3.203.16	They say, 'Give it to us both.'"
3.203.17	Whatever is your mind, which is to be praised in the directions, is heard, great.
3.203.18	By that, indeed, you have seen the firm, unbreakable, wealth for the sake of pressing.
3.203.19	Thus.
3.203.20	He thought: "The sages are asking me for a firm boon.
3.203.21	They do not know the unbreakable one, desiring to see."
3.203.22	Whatever you bestow, O Indra, the desirable, that you should give.
3.203.23	We know that Vidya of yours, O Akoopara, for the sake of giving.
3.203.24	Thus it is said.
3.203.25	He knew that Akoopara was looking at him.
3.203.26	He said to him, "This is my own, this is the great one of the sages, as if with both hands." They said, "You are bearing it."
3.203.27	They saw him.
3.203.28	These are the verses related to desire.
3.203.29	They desired this very desire.
3.203.30	He is honoured by these (verses).
3.203.31	He who praises with these verses, his desire is fulfilled.
3.204.1	In them there is Vasistha's transgression of the Vinka.
3.204.2	Now indeed one crosses the Anushtubh with the Anushtubha.
3.204.3	This Anushtubh becomes thirty-three syllables.
3.204.4	With that he transgresses.
3.204.5	Vasishtha, having lost his son, desired, "May I attain the heavenly worlds, may I attain them through offspring and cattle."
3.204.6	He saw this Sama.
3.204.7	He praised with it.
3.204.8	He attained these worlds through it, he attained them through offspring and through cattle.
3.204.9	This is the heavenly, generative Sama.
3.204.10	He attains the worlds of the gods, he attains offspring and cattle, he who knows this.
3.204.11	It becomes the Stobha-Anutunna.
3.204.12	From the Anutunna are born offspring and cattle.
3.204.13	The Chandomas are cattle.
3.204.14	By that one attains prosperity.
3.204.15	What Vasishtha saw, therefore it is called the Vink of Vasishtha.
3.204.16	That is the Iḍa-sāman for the Acchāvāka.
3.204.17	The Iḍa is indeed cattle.
3.204.18	They indeed establish themselves in cattle.
3.205.1	They are sung with the verse, "They anoint the young one, the newborn, the tawny one." They are sung with the verses containing the word "tawny".
3.205.2	The tawny one is the highest form of speech.
3.205.3	They desire speech through the metres.
3.205.4	Now speech becomes attained in the metres.
3.205.5	They thus obtain her.
3.205.6	"They shine, the sage with the host of Maruts," they become Marutvati.
3.205.7	The Maruts are the form of the Tristubh.
3.205.8	This is the Tristubh day.
3.205.9	And the Tristubh is the nobility, the Maruts are the people.
3.205.10	Now, the Marutvatī verses are in the Tristubh metre. In this way they make the people follow the Kshatriya.
3.205.11	Therefore, the people follow the kshatriya. The wise one, with his wisdom, goes beyond the Soma and the Pavitra, going beyond.
3.205.12	The Rishis, the creators of the Rishis, with their own Rishis, of a thousand ways, the paths of the poets, thus they approach the Chandomas of a thousand forms.
3.205.13	The Chandomas are indeed cattle.
3.205.14	The buffalo seeks the third abode, for this is the third day on which the Chandomas are performed.
3.205.15	Soma rules in accordance with Viraj. They approach the Tristubh form.
3.205.16	For this is the Taritstubh day.
3.205.17	And the former is the king of the Sahas.
3.205.18	The Chandramas follow him.
3.205.19	The hawk, the bird, the arrow, the thunderbolt, the thunderbolt, and the thunderbolt, carrying the weapons, the thunderbolt, carrying weapons, the thunderbolt. These are the verses of the cow, of the cattle. They are for the securing of cattle, for cattle are the metres.
3.205.20	For cattle are the metres,
3.205.21	Following the wave of the waters, the ocean. These are the ocean-verses. They are the form of the metres.
3.205.22	The ocean is the metres.
3.205.23	The fourth abode is proclaimed by the bull. For the fourth day is made up of the Chandomas.
3.206.1	These are the Tristubhs, in the form of the day, made up of the Tristubh verses.
3.206.2	Where they make up the form of the days, there they are made up.
3.206.3	He who knows this is made up.
3.206.4	These are the Soma-pressings, they are dear to him. The word 'abhi' is used. This is the form of Rathantara.
3.206.5	This is the Rathantara day.
3.206.6	They have fulfilled Indra's desire. Since it is connected with Indra, it is in the form of Tristubh.
3.206.7	For the Tristubh is the kingdom.
3.206.8	"The strength of him who is growing," for this day is indeed growing, since it is the forty-fourth. The hymn is in accordance with the metre; cattle are the hymn, cattle are the metres; for the securing of cattle.
3.206.9	And cattle are the hymn; cattle are the earth.
3.206.10	They make the cattle of the earth in accordance with the metres.
3.206.11	Here they do not act according to direct perception.
3.206.12	Therefore cattle produce offspring of various forms: a white one produces a black one, a black one a white one, a tawny one a dun one, a dun one a tawny one.
3.206.13	It becomes nine-coloured.
3.206.14	There are nine breaths in man.
3.206.15	They proceed prospering with the breaths, standing in the breaths.
3.206.16	The second has nine verses, the third has nine verses.
3.206.17	They proceed thus, gradually increasing with the vital airs.
3.206.18	It has five verses, the Pankti has five feet.
3.206.19	Cattle are Pankti.
3.206.20	Cattle are the metres. For the purpose of securing cattle.
3.206.21	They say, the Rtu-man (season-endowed) is the Pañcadaśa (rite), the Anṛtavas (non-seasonal) are the Chandomas (rites).
3.206.22	They are established as if in the non-seasonal (rites), because they are Chandomas.
3.206.23	Since these five or six verses are there, the Chandomas are made season-endowed by that.
3.206.24	There is a permutation for the stability of offspring and the presence of cattle.
3.206.25	The Stoma becomes forty-four.
3.206.26	The Tristubh has forty-four syllables.
3.206.27	The Tristup is Indra's power and strength.
3.206.28	They go on, standing in Indra's power, in his strength.
3.207.1	The offering of ghee is to Agni, with the Agni-sages, in unison. It is the Rathantara.
3.207.2	This is the Rathantara day.
3.207.3	Make the messenger of the sacrifice the best.
3.207.4	He who is the most truthful among mortals, the most radiant, the most pure, the most eater of ghee, the most shining,
3.207.5	Thus.
3.207.6	This is indeed the beloved abode of Agni, namely ghee.
3.207.7	They make him prosperous with his own beloved abode.
3.207.8	The horse is not satisfied with fodder, it is for the sake of overcoming the enemy.
3.207.9	When it rose from the great covering, it is a great day, the fourth.
3.207.10	The wind blows from it, the light shines, the dark path is yours.
3.207.11	When the wind blows the fire, then it blazes forth.
3.207.12	This is the form of the radiance of Brahman.
3.207.13	"They approach the form of the Tristubh with the words, "O Agni, the new-born, the young, the strong,"
3.207.14	because this day is Tristubh."
3.207.15	"Agni, the immortal, moves here."
3.207.16	The ruddy one, seeking smoke, the messenger, Agni, you go to the gods.
3.207.17	Thus for the attainment of the heavenly world.
3.208.1	"What today when the sun has risen," this is for Maitrāvaruṇa.
3.208.2	"What" is the form of Rathantara.
3.208.3	This is the Rathantara day.
3.208.4	Mित्र, Aryaman,
3.208.5	Savitar, Bhaga,
3.208.6	May the good be well-spread, may the bad be well-spread.
3.208.7	May the good go to the good giver of gifts.
3.208.8	Thus one who has gone beyond.
3.208.9	And the king of the self-ruling, Aditi, the inviolable vow,
3.208.10	The great kings rule.
3.208.11	Thus this is a great day, the forty-fourth.
3.208.12	You invoke that Indra. It becomes Indra.
3.208.13	"To the great Vritra, to slay him" (is said), as if to slay.
3.208.14	This is indeed the praise of the sacrificer himself, which is of Brahman.
3.208.15	In his own place, they slay all the sin of the sacrificer.
3.208.16	"He is the bull, the bull, the lord" (is said). It is like a bull.
3.208.17	The bull is the form of the Tristubh.
3.208.18	This is the Tristubh day.
3.208.19-22	Indra, the most powerful, is the one who has been made to be the most powerful. It is with this third (day) that the gods went upwards to heaven. He was not included in them. He was excluded. Indra, the most powerful one, is the one made to be the strongest. He placed his strength in him.
3.208.23	The thunderbolt of speech is not collected, thus they collected him.
3.208.24	He who is strong and does not fall, thus they made him strong.
3.208.25	Having prepared him, they went to the heavenly world with him.
3.208.26	That which is this clarified butter, it is for the attainment of the heavenly world and for the completion of the world.
3.208.27	What is the Indra-Agni of the first day, that is the Indra-Agnia Rathantara.
3.208.28-32	This is the Rathantara day. The Soma-pressings are equal. The Soma pressings of the six-day Prsthya and the Chandomas are like two villages with different boundaries. Just as one who has made friends with the people of different villages would be safe, so it is when the Soma pressings are equal. But some make them unequal.
3.208.33	Therefore, one should do the rites in accordance with the Sama.
3.208.34	The Stoma becomes forty-four.
3.208.35	The Tristubh has forty-four syllables.
3.208.36	The Tristup is Indra's power and strength.
3.208.37	They proceed, standing in Indra's power, in the form of the Tristubh.
3.209.1	They proceed in the form of Tristubh with the words "O Adhvaryu, the pressed (Soma) with mountains."
3.209.2	This is the Tristubh day.
3.209.3	O Soma, lead me to the purifying (rite).
3.209.4	Purify for Indra to drink.
3.209.5	Thy, O Indra, are these streams.
3.209.6	Thus they become having the Andhasu (verse). Andhasu means food. For the securing of food.
3.209.7	The gods have entered the honey.
3.209.8	Of Pavamana, O Maruts.
3.209.9	Thus they (the verses) become having the Maruts.
3.209.10	The midday is like the Maruts.
3.209.11	They do not go beyond the form of midday.
3.209.12	The best of the nectar of heaven, for this is the best of the three days, when the Chandomas are performed.
3.209.13	Among them, the Gayatri is as explained in the Brahmanas.
3.209.14	Then the Rathantara with the Anjas and Padanidhanas.
3.209.15	Therefore, it is performed on the Rathantara day.
3.209.16	The gods desired, "May we ascend to heaven by force."
3.209.17	They saw this Sama.
3.209.18	They praised with it.
3.209.19	Then indeed they ascended to heaven by force.
3.209.20	That itself is the force, the forceful nature.
3.209.21	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.209.22	He who knows this ascends to heaven by force.
3.209.23	That is called Vairūpa.
3.209.24	Animals are Virūpa.
3.209.25	Virūpa is animals.
3.209.26	He thus unites animals with animals.
3.209.27	Virūpāṅgiras, desiring animals, performed austerities.
3.209.28	He saw this Sama.
3.209.29	He praised with it.
3.209.30	Then he obtained animals.
3.209.31	This is the animal Sama.
3.209.32	He who knows this, becomes one who has many cattle.
3.209.33	Because Virupa Angiras saw this, therefore it is called Vairepa.
3.210.1	Then the Sama of the Dhurā, the Rāthantara of the Dravaḍiḍa.
3.210.2	Therefore it is performed on the Rāthantara day.
3.210.3	The Dhurā is the Chandas.
3.210.4	The Chandomas are like those that have been used up.
3.210.5-9	Now, in that the Sāman is performed here in the form of a burden, it is by means of that alone that the Chandomas are performed, the Dhūrvanta (Sāmans) are performed, the Chandomas (Sāmans), the Dhūrvanti (Sāmans). Now, the breath is the burden. Cattle is the burden. It is indeed said, 'The cattle are the burden.' It is indeed said, ‘The cattle are the breath.' It is thus established in the breath and cattle. Then the three-fold Nidhanas (of the Savanas) for the establishment of the Savanas.
3.210.10	This indeed is the prosperous, the Gāyatrī with three feet.
3.210.11	Idan Kāvya, desiring heaven, performed austerities.
3.210.12	He saw this Sama.
3.210.13	He praised with it.
3.210.14	He ascended this world with the first foot, the intermediate world with the second, and the heaven with the third.
3.210.15	He ascended these three worlds.
3.210.16	Then he indeed stood in the heavenly world.
3.210.17	This is the heavenly, the establishing Sāman.
3.210.18	He goes to the heavenly world, he stands in the heavenly world, who knows thus.
3.210.19	What Iḍa Kāvya saw, therefore it is called Iḍata.
3.210.20	Then the Sāman of Indra and Soma, the destroyer of enemies,
3.210.21	He destroys the enemy, the foe. Indra goes to the call of him who knows this.
3.210.22	Now the Sauparna (hymn) with the Brāhmaṇa recited.
3.210.23	It has four verses and four feet, for animals have four feet, and the Chandomas are animals. For the securing of animals.
3.211.1	Now the Ashu (hymn).
3.211.2	The gods desired: "May we quickly go to heaven."
3.211.3	They saw this Sama.
3.211.4	They praised with it.
3.211.5	Then indeed they quickly went to the heavenly world.
3.211.6	That very blessing is quickness.
3.211.7	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.211.8	He who knows this indeed goes to the heavenly world with this.
3.211.9	They indeed call it "quick Bhārgava".
3.211.10	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
3.211.11	The gods ran to Bhṛgu, saying, "Let us conquer the Asuras."
3.211.12	Bhṛgu saw this Sama.
3.211.13	He praised with it.
3.211.14	Then the gods conquered the Asuras.
3.211.15	They said, "Indeed, this became Bhṛgu's quickness."
3.211.16	That is indeed the quickness of Ashu.
3.211.17	It is indeed the destroyer of enemies, the bestower of desires.
3.211.18	It destroys the enemy, the foe.
3.211.19	Whatever one desires, one attains by reciting this (hymn).
3.212.1	Then the Rāthantara (hymn) with the Margiya Vam Padanidhana.
3.212.2	From that the Rāthantara is performed on the day.
3.212.3	The god Mṛgayu desired: 'May I attain lordship over both kinds of animals, those that are domestic and those that are wild.'
3.212.4	He saw this Sama.
3.212.5	He praised with it.
3.212.6	Then he attained lordship over all animals, both domestic and wild.
3.212.7	Then a deer would bring another deer to him.
3.212.8	This is the Pasvya Sama.
3.212.9	One who knows this attains lordship over all animals both domestic and wild.
3.212.10	This indeed is the god, the hunter.
3.212.11	He who knows this does not covet the animals of another.
3.212.12	Because the god, the Hunter, saw (the animals), therefore it is called 'Margiyava'.
3.213.1	'The Soma-pressers have come', 'abhi' means 'come'. This is the form of Rathantara.
3.213.2	This is the Rathantara day.
3.213.3	They purify the intoxicating drink.
3.213.4	The wise one, the jealous one, has fallen from his intoxication, on the ocean's shore.
3.213.5	Thus are the forms of the lunar days in the ocean.
3.213.6	The lunar days are indeed the ocean.
3.213.7	Pavamāna crosses the ocean with waves, the king, the great truth of the gods.
3.213.8	Flowing with the law of Mitra and Varuna, urging the great truth,
3.213.9	The king, the god of the ocean, is praised by men, is praised by the wise, is praised by those who know.
3.213.10	Thus it is four verses. Animals have four feet.
3.213.11	Animals are the Chandomas. For the attainment of animals.
3.213.12	Among them, the Vamadevya with two recitations.
3.213.13	Animals are boundaries.
3.213.14	Animals are Revatis.
3.213.15	Animals are Vamadevya, with two recitations.
3.213.16	Those who praise with this (hymn) become possessed of cattle.
3.213.17	Prajapati created cattle.
3.213.18	They, created by him, knowing nothing, fled from him.
3.213.19	He pursued them, saying, "May the cattle know me."
3.213.20	"May they not flee from me."
3.213.21	He saw this Sama.
3.213.22	He praised with it.
3.213.23	Then the cattle recognized him.
3.213.24	Then they did not leave him.
3.213.25	This is the two-fold meaning:
3.213.26	"Hum" is what the cattle recognize, "hum" is what the mother approaches the son, "hum" the son approaches the mother.
3.213.27	This is a sign of cattle.
3.213.28	The cattle know him, the cattle do not go away from him, he who knows thus.
3.213.29	That is the Iḍa (verse). Cattle are Iḍa, cattle are the Chandas verses. For the securing of cattle.
3.214.1	Now the Gāyatrīpārśva (verse).
3.214.2	These worlds are the Gāyatrīs.
3.214.3	They are established in these worlds.
3.214.4	The gods, desiring heaven, practised austerities.
3.214.5	They saw this Sama.
3.214.6	They praised with it.
3.214.7	It, having become Gāyatrī, carried them to the heavenly world.
3.214.8	Having gone to the heavenly world, they said, "Gāyatrī alone was the wing of our Sama."
3.214.9	That itself is the Gāyatrī-wingness of the Gāyatrīs.
3.214.10	This is indeed the name of the Gayatra side.
3.214.11	It is called the Gayatra side,
3.214.12	because it is like the sound 'him' for the sake of obtaining food.
3.214.13	Prajapati gave food to his creatures by means of the sound 'him'.
3.214.14	He who knows this is given food.
3.215.1	Then the Puruhansaman, the beginning of the sacrifice, the retreat.
3.215.2	He starts with the ninth day and runs back to the seventh.
3.215.3	The gods, by starting, drove away the Asuras from the sacrifice.
3.215.4	Puruhansa Vaikhanasa, desiring cattle, practised austerities.
3.215.5	He saw this Sama.
3.215.6	He praised with it.
3.215.7	He approached this Ida.
3.215.8	Ida is cattle.
3.215.9	Then he indeed obtained the cattle.
3.215.10	This is the cattle-obtaining Sāman.
3.215.11	He who knows this obtains cattle and becomes one with many cattle.
3.215.12	Because Puruhansama Vāikhānasya saw it, therefore it is called Pāruhanman.
3.215.13	The gods and the Asuras were contending.
3.215.14	The gods desired, "May we slay the Asuras first."
3.216.3	The gods, having taken the entire sacrifice, ascended to the heavenly world.
3.216.4	The men did not know the sacrifice.
3.216.5	It was cut off.
3.216.6	The gods and men ate, for the gods live by what is given from here, and men by what is given there.
3.216.7	The oblations went upward, and the rain did not come down.
3.216.8	The gods said to Ayasya, "The men do not know the sacrifice."
3.216.9	He cut it off.
3.216.10	"Arrange the sacrifice for them."
3.216.11	Ayasya came and arranged the sacrifice for the men with this very hymn.
3.216.12	This sacrifice was arranged for the men.
3.216.13	Having dwelt among the men, he again did not know the heavenly world.
3.216.14-18	He desired, 'May I know the heavenly world.' He, having praised with this very Sāman, again knew the heavenly world. This is the heavenly Sāman. One who knows this attains the heavenly world. And this Sāman is indeed the heavenly Sāma. And this Sāman indeed is the heavenly Sūrya. One who thus knows this attains the heaven of the sun. And this indeed is the heavenly world. One who knows this attains heaven. And this is the heavenly world.
3.216.19	When he came from this world to the other world, and when he went from the other world to this world, he twice traversed these two worlds. That is why Dvaigata is called Dvaigata.
3.216.20	Dvaigata indeed is the one who goes twice.
3.217.1	Then there is Hara-yana.
3.217.2	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
3.217.3	The gods desired, "We shall take away the Hara of the Asuras."
3.217.4	They saw this Sama.
3.217.5	They praised with it.
3.217.6	With it they took away the wealth of the Asuras.
3.217.7	In that they took away the (wealth of the) Asuras, that is the reason for the name of Hārayaṇa.
3.217.8	He who knows this takes away the wealth of his enemies.
3.217.9	Hārayaṇa Āṅgirasa, desiring cattle, practised austerity.
3.217.10	He saw this Sama. 
3.217.11	He praised with it.
3.217.12-16	O Indra, with all your powers, you are the lord of cattle. We follow you, the glorious, the giver of wealth, the hero. The guardian of the horse, the giver of cattle, the golden one, the god. Thus he obtained cattle and horses. Having worshipped with those animals, he went to heaven.
3.217.17	This is the Pashaviya and Svarga-winning Sama.
3.217.18	He who knows this obtains cattle and goes to the Svarga world.
3.217.19	And because Hara-yana Angiras saw it, therefore it is called Hara-yana.
3.218.1	Then the Rathantera (Sama) with unbroken and concluding verses.
3.218.2	Therefore it is performed on the Rathantera day.
3.218.3	Prajapati desired, "May I be without a gap with offspring and cattle."
3.218.4	That very thing is the state of being without a gap.
3.218.5	One who knows this becomes indeed without a gap with progeny and cattle.
3.218.6	The gods, having obtained speech, robbed them of these worlds by means of the without-a-gap (verse).
3.218.7	Now speech has become obtained in the Chandomas.
3.218.8	They fill it with the unbroken (vessel).
3.218.9	He who fills it with the broken (vessel) does not fill it.
3.218.10	But he who fills it with unbroken (vessel) fills it.
3.218.11	The excess is the beginning. He abandons the ninth day and begins the tenth day. He runs back to the seventh day.
3.218.12	Prajapati created the animals.
3.218.13	They fled from him when created.
3.218.14	He desired, "May my cattle not flee from me, may they turn towards me."
3.218.15	He saw this Sama.
3.218.16	He surrounded them with it.
3.218.17	He took them with the foremost.
3.218.18	They were pleased with him.
3.218.19	The animals enjoy themselves in it; he who knows this becomes the owner of cattle.
3.219.1	Now the Barhad-uktha.
3.219.2	Brihdukttha Angirasa, desiring cattle, practised austerities.
3.219.3	He saw this Sama.
3.219.4	He praised with it.
3.219.5	He approached this Ida.
3.219.6	Ida is indeed cattle.
3.219.7	From then on he obtained cattle.
3.219.8	This is the Pashaviya (Sāman).
3.219.9	He who knows this obtains cattle and becomes one with many cattle.
3.219.10	Because Brihad-uktha saw the Angirasa, therefore it is called Brihad-uktham.
3.219.11	The sustainer of heaven flows, the creator, the juice, for the sustenance of the day.
3.219.12	The Dakshas, the gods, are the metres. Thus they make the metres prosper for the strength of the day.
3.219.13	In them there is a three-fold growth.
3.219.14	For this is the third growth that is made, since this is the third day, for the completion of the heavenly world.
3.219.15	And that is called the Vishala.
3.219.16	The gods, desiring heaven, practised austerities.
3.219.17	They saw this Sama.
3.219.18	They praised with it.
3.219.19	It brought them to heaven, having become extensive.
3.219.20	Having gone to the heavenly world, they said, "This Sama has brought us to the heavenly world having become extensive."
3.219.21	That is the extensiveness of the Visala.
3.219.22-27	This is the heavenly Sama. He who knows this attains the heavenly world. Just as the regions of the sky are so are the regions of the vast (sky). For the attainment of the heavenly world. He who knows this attains heaven. Now the Rathantara. Brahman is the Rathantara.
3.219.28	They go to Brahman itself, to which they are attached.
3.219.29	It is on the Trishtup day.
3.219.30	The Trishtup is the form of a male, the Rathantara of a female.
3.219.31	In that the Rathantara is the Sāman on this day, it is thereby made a pair.
3.219.32	Then the Vamadevya.
3.219.33	The Vamadevya is cattle.
3.219.34	Those who praise with this (hymn) become possessed of cattle.
3.219.35	When he says, 'Indra in the east, in the west, in the north', he thus summons Indra from all directions.
3.219.36	In the attained days, if you are in this direction, if you are here, if you are there.
3.220.1	In them is the Rāthantara Sāman with the last Pada.
3.220.2	Therefore it is performed on the Rāthantara day.
3.220.3	Those gods desired, 'May we conquer the Asuras.'
3.220.4	They saw this Sama.
3.220.5	They praised with it.
3.220.6	They conquered the Asuras.
3.220.7	That is the meaning of 'vasa'.
3.220.8	He who knows this conquers his enemies.
3.220.9	Who knows him, the son of the wise, the wise one, the wise one? The wise ones approach him, for non-deterioration.
3.220.10	Among them is the Nepa-tithi.
3.220.11	The Kanvayanasa were sitting in a sacrifice when cattle were brought to them.
3.220.12	They desired, "May we obtain cattle."
3.220.13	Nepa-tithi Kanva saw this Sama.
3.220.14	He praised with it.
3.220.15	Then they obtained cattle.
3.220.16	This is the Pashaviya (Sāman).
3.220.17	He who knows this obtains cattle and becomes one with many cattle.
3.220.18	Because Nepa-Atithi Kanva saw it, therefore it is called Nepa-Atitha.
3.220.19	One should listen to both (the Sāmans) and not listen to both. One begins with both forms, that of the six-day Pañcahas and that of the Chandomas.
3.220.20	Therefore, one should perform the Brahma-sāman in this connection for the two sacrificers.
3.221.1	In that (sāman) there is the Vyāśva (sāman).
3.221.2	The sage Gayasvī, the paternal uncle of Vyāśva, saw his nephew, the embryo of Vyāśvas, lying in the womb, saying, "He will be born."
3.221.3	When he was born, he said to him, "You are born by the son of Jāta."
3.221.4	His shadow did not leave him.
3.221.5	May our thumbs be well.
3.221.6	They told him, "He who is the boy, you said he is alive."
3.221.7	He took a mallet and went to strike him.
3.221.8	He desired, "May I go from here and find a protector."
3.221.9	He saw this Sama.
3.221.10	He sang it.
3.221.11	Then his mace fell back and cut off his head.
3.221.12	This is the hymn of the one who knows the path and the protector, the destroyer of enemies.
3.221.13	He who knows this destroys his enemies and finds the path and the guardian.
3.221.14	What Vyasva saw, that is why it is called Vaishvam.
3.221.15	This is a hymn for the Adhvaryu priest.
3.221.16	The Iḍā is indeed the animals.
3.221.17	They indeed find support in the animals.
3.222.1	(They say) "Flow, O god, for life" in the form of Tristubh.
3.222.2	This is the third day.
3.222.3	May Indra go to your intoxication.
3.222.4	Mount Vayu with Dharma.
3.222.5	Thus they become intoxicated.
3.222.6	Intoxication is indeed the juice.
3.222.7	The third pressing is indeed like a daughter.
3.222.8	Whatever these (verses) are with Madhu, they put juice into it. They nourish it with this.
3.222.9	O Pavamāna, thou shinest forth, O Soma, the desirable wealth.
3.222.10	O Indra, enter the ocean.
3.222.11	Thus they are with the ocean. The form of the Chandomas.
3.222.12	The Chandomas are indeed the ocean.
3.222.13	"He shines, destroying the evil," (with these words) he destroys evil.
3.222.14	In these (verses) the Gayatri is as explained in the Brahmana.
3.222.15	Then the Rathantara, ending with the word "mada".
3.222.16	From that (verse) the Rathantara day is performed.
3.222.17	The gods desired, "May Soma be ours, we may drink Soma."
3.222.18	They saw this Sama.
3.222.19	Therefore they praised.
3.222.20	Then indeed their Soma became the Madhu, the Madhu of Soma.
3.222.21	That itself is the Madhu of the Madhu.
3.222.22	That is indeed the Madhu. It is the juice.
3.222.23	Indeed they were satisfied with the juice.
3.222.24	He who knows thus becomes possessed of Soma and juice.
3.222.25	And indeed these (verses) would be as if obstructed, if they were to do this here.
3.222.26	The Chandomas are like daughters, being the abode of the third pressing.
3.222.27	The third pressing is like a daughter.
3.222.28	What is sweet here, that they put into the Chandomas, and thus they nourish them.
3.223.1	Then the beautiful, for the fulfilment of beauty.
3.223.2	The Angirasas, while practising austerities, were exhausted by beauty and splendour.
3.223.3	They desired, "May we attain beauty and splendor."
3.223.4	They saw this Sama.
3.223.5	They praised with it.
3.223.6	Then indeed they attained beauty and splendor.
3.223.7	They said, "We have become beautiful."
3.223.8	That itself is the beauty of the beautiful.
3.223.9	One attains beauty and splendor who knows thus.
3.223.10	Sūrupa Āṅgirasa, desiring cattle, practiced austerity.
3.223.11	He saw this Sama.
3.223.12	He praised with it.
3.223.13	He approached this Iḍa.
3.223.14	Iḍa is cattle.
3.223.15	From there he obtained cattle.
3.223.16	This is the cattle-obtaining Sama.
3.223.17	One who knows this obtains cattle, becomes a great cattle-owner.
3.223.18	Because Surūpa Āṅgirasa saw it, therefore it is called Surūpa.
3.223.19	Prajapati created the animals.
3.223.20	When they were created, their forms were not recognized.
3.223.21	He saw these beautiful forms.
3.223.22	He gave them those forms.
3.223.23	That is the beauty of the beautiful ones.
3.223.24	One who knows this obtains animals with form.
3.223.25	The Chandomas are indeed the same as the Arka, having beautiful forms.
3.223.26-30	Those who know thus, the Chhandas, the metres, and the gods, praise with them. The Chhandas shines again and again. Wherever the gods found the essence of the Chhandas they made it shine again and again, they struck it again and again. The Chhandas are like daughters, having their abode in the third pressing. The third pressing is like a daughter.
3.223.31	Now, when the metre is again raised, they place the juice in the metres.
3.223.32	This is the continuation of the juice.
3.224.1	Now, the Kakshivat.
3.224.2	Kakshivat desired: 'May I beget many offspring and cattle, may I attain prosperity and sovereignty.'
3.224.3	He saw this Sama.
3.224.4	He praised with it.
3.224.5	Then indeed he, being many, became prosperous with offspring and cattle, and attained prosperity and sovereignty.
3.224.6	They indeed were the thousand of Kāksīvatas.
3.224.7	By those sons indeed he attained prosperity and sovereignty
3.224.8	He who knows this attains prosperity and goes to sovereignty.
3.224.9	That is the Stobha-anuttana (verse).
3.224.10	From the Anuttana indeed offspring and cattle are born.
3.224.11	The animals are the metres.
3.224.12	By that (rite) one attains prosperity.
3.224.13	Because Kakshivan saw (it), therefore it is called Kakshivat.
3.225.1	Now (follows) the Pramanihishthiyam (rite).
3.225.2	When the sages were sitting in a sacrifice, the animals were stolen.
3.225.3	They desired: "We should obtain the animals."
3.225.4	They said: "Let us request Agni for the animals.
3.225.5-13	He is indeed the lord of cattle. He alone will give us cattle." They saw this Sama (hymn) and praised him with it. "They sang to the most bountiful one, to the truthful, to the great, to the bright-shining one. The eulogizers sang to Agni. Thus. He said to them, "What is your desire?" They said, "We desire cattle."
3.225.14	He gave the animals to them with this very same Sama.
3.225.15	They said, "He has become the most powerful among us."
3.225.16	That itself is the most powerful nature of the most powerful.
3.225.17	This is the animal-giving Sama.
3.225.18	He who knows this becomes the most powerful among men and obtains animals. He becomes one with many animals.
3.225.19	That is the same as the Pāvamānī verse.
3.225.20	Wherever the gods found the essence of the metres, they made it the same again and again.
3.225.21	Those who are the metres of the Soma-pressing days are like daughters to the third pressing.
3.225.22	The third pressing is like a daughter.
3.225.23	Now, when the hymn is recited again, it is indeed the juice that is placed in the hymns.
3.225.24	It is indeed the juice which they (the gods) have obtained.
3.226.1	Then the hymn of the sun, the sun indeed is food; for the securing of food.
3.226.2	The Apsarases are indeed called 'having a head of one's own'; these are indeed the plants.
3.226.3	They desired, "May we be many, may we beget offspring, may we attain this world."
3.226.4	They saw this Sama.
3.226.5	They praised with it.
3.226.6	Then indeed they became many, begot offspring, and attained this world.
3.226.7	This entire world is covered with plants, even the mountains.
3.226.8	This is the generative Sama.
3.226.9	He who knows this becomes one who has many offspring and cattle, and attains this world.
3.226.10	Because they saw the Apsarases in the form of a head, therefore it is called "the sun with a head."
3.226.11	"The bright, great fame," here "abhi" means the form of Rathantara.
3.226.12	This is the Rathantara day.
3.226.13	"The cows are the ones who make the mind flourish for the sake of the cattle. They become cows and cattle, for the sake of securing cattle.
3.226.14	For cattle are the metres.
3.227.1	In them is the Vaisirya of Vayu, the son of Arsha.
3.227.2	Vayu is Vaisirya.
3.227.3	Whatever is destroyed in the sacrifice of those who are sacrificing, that Vayu restores to them.
3.227.4	Vayu indeed is the breath.
3.227.5	The breath itself heals them.
3.227.6	One performs the expiation with this very healing.
3.227.7	"They approach the form of an animal, saying, "The breath is the child of the great ones."
3.227.8	For the breath is the child among animals.
3.227.9	The three-fold Brāhmaṇa is mentioned in them.
3.227.10	"The verse "Come to us, O Vāja, the most excellent" contains the form of Rathantara.
3.227.11	This is the Rathantara day.
3.227.12	O Indra, do thou flow on, the hundred-longed,
3.227.13	O Indra, the thousand-longed, the hundred-streamed, the thousand-streamed,
3.227.14	the hundred-streamed.
3.227.15	Whatever is a hundredfold, a thousandfold, that is the form of the Chandomas.
3.227.16	The Chandomas are cattle.
3.227.17	"He has gone round his own (waters), the Indra, the unerring, the flowing, the flowing." They are flowing.
3.227.18	They thus put the juice and the intoxicating drink in the third pressing.
3.227.19	We are the most worthy of thy gifts, O Vasu, of thy wealth, O Vasu.
3.227.20	May we be the most worthy of thine gifts, O Vasus, of thy wealth.
3.227.21	They become cows and cattle-owning. For the securing of cattle.
3.227.22	For cattle are the metres.
3.227.23	In them is the hymn to the cow, as explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.228.1	Now the pure and impure.
3.228.2	Indra, having killed the Asuras, thought, "I am impure, unclean."
3.228.3	He desired, "Let them praise me for a month with pure Sama."
3.228.4	He said to the sages, "Praise me."
3.228.5	The sages saw this Sama.
3.228.6	They praised him with it.
3.228.7-13	Thus indeed we praise Indra, the pure, with a pure hymn. With pure praises, he has grown, with pure praises, may he be pleased with me. Thus it is said. Then indeed Indra became pure, purified, and fit for sacrifice. This is the purifying Sāman. He who knows this becomes pure, purified, fit for sacrifice. Now the Udalam.
3.228.14	Udala, the son of Devaratha, desired, "May I be the foremost, the chief, the most brilliant."
3.228.15	He saw this Sama.
3.228.16	He praised with it.
3.228.17	Then he became the foremost, the most brilliant, the most brilliant.
3.228.18	They perform a sacrifice, saying, "We will be the foremost, chief, and most brilliant."
3.228.19	They indeed become the foremost, chief and most brilliant.
3.228.20	It is made in the Anushtubh metre for the sake of the abundance of forms.
3.228.21	The Anushtubh is the womb of the Gāyatrī.
3.228.22	Having become a pair, the animals undertake their activities.
3.228.23	The animals are the metres.
3.228.24	Therefore, it is done in the metres.
3.228.25	What Devāratta saw from above, that is why it is called Audala.
3.229.1	Now the Pañcvaja.
3.229.2	By this (hymn) Pañcvajas Kauṣṭa drank up both the worlds, the divine and the human.
3.229.3	They drank them up by this (hymn).
3.229.4	Pañcvajas Kautsa desired: 'May I drink up both the worlds - the divine and the man-made.'
3.229.5	He saw this Sama.
3.229.6	He praised with it.
3.229.7	Then indeed he drank both the divine and the human Soma.
3.229.8	Then indeed he, having placed the Suradriti, preserves the Soma for the purpose.
3.229.9	This is the prosperity of food.
3.229.10	He who knows thus drinks both the divine and human Soma.
3.229.11	The Pañcāvajya is so called because Kauṣṭa saw five sacrifices.
3.229.12	Now the Krauncha.
3.229.13	Kruṅṅāṅgirasa found the Iṣya on the way.
3.229.14	The Chandomas are like the Iṣya.
3.229.15	Therefore, it is performed in the Chandomas.
3.229.16	It becomes the Madhyasvara.
3.229.17	Prāṇa is the Svaras.
3.229.18	The Chandomas are like a healing.
3.229.19	Two days are combined.
3.229.20	In the middle, there is a Svarasvara. They place the breath in the Chandomas. They heal them with this.
3.230.1	Then the middle-ending hymn of prosperity. For stability.
3.230.2	Those who perform the Pavamāna rite of the Ārbhava (Sāman) cross over to the ocean.
3.230.3	That it ends in the middle is for the sake of stability.
3.230.4	Prajapati created the animals.
3.230.5	They, having been created, fled from him.
3.230.6	He desired, "May my animals not flee, may they turn towards me."
3.230.7	He saw this Sama.
3.230.8	He praised with it.
3.230.9	Then the cattle turned towards him.
3.230.10	Then they became non-departing from him.
3.230.11	He said, "Wealth has indeed stood in me."
3.230.12	That itself is the state of being the most wealthy.
3.230.13	This is the Sama for cattle.
3.230.14	Wealth stands in him, and his cattle return to him; his cattle do not go away from him, who knows thus.
3.230.15	It becomes half-verse, for the Iḍā is cattle.
3.230.16	The verses are cattle, for the securing of cattle.
3.230.17	Then these are the two-footed verses, as already explained.
3.230.18	These are the verses: "Flow, O Soma, great like the ocean."
3.230.19	For the forty-fourth day is indeed great.
3.230.20	The father of the gods shines in all abodes, it becomes the form of Rathantara.
3.230.21	This day is Rathantara.
3.231.1	In them is Dharma.
3.231.2	The gods, taking the law, defeated the Asuras, who were without law, by making them law-breakers.
3.231.3	He who knows this, taking the law by means of the law, defeats his hateful enemy by making him a law-breaker.
3.231.4	That is Dharma, that is prosperity, that is the kingdom. By Dharma the king becomes Dharma. He becomes Dharma to his subjects. They follow him. He upholds Dharma.
3.231.5	They say that it should be performed on the ninth day.
3.231.6	The Barhaspatya is indeed the Kshatra.
3.231.7	And this is the Vidara Rathantara.
3.231.8-12	They say, "The kings are the upholders of the law. They do not follow the law of other men." This indeed is the Kshatra, the thirty-four Tristubh. Therefore on the ninth day the law may be violated. This is said here. The mares, the sisters, the wives, the lords of the house, the great Indra, the young ones of the earth, induce the sun.
3.232.3	Uśanas Kāvya desired the immortal Gandharva world among the gods.
3.232.4	He saw this Sama.
3.232.5	He praised with it.
3.232.6	Then he obtained the immortal Gandharvaloka among the gods. This is the one with hair.
3.232.7	These are the ones of Kāvya.
3.232.8	One obtains the immortal Gandharvī world among the gods with this one having hair. One who praises with this obtains.
3.232.9	Agni indeed dwelt among the gods.
3.232.10	The gods did not please him.
3.232.11	He, being displeased, approached Uśanas Kāvya.
3.232.12	He said to him, "O sage, please me. I am not pleased."
3.232.13	He desired, "I should please him."
3.232.14	He saw this Sama.
3.232.15	With that he pleased him.
3.232.16	I praise your most beloved guest, as a friend, as a dear one.
3.232.17	O Agni, the chariot is to be known.
3.232.18	Thus they made him the most beloved guest.
3.232.19	He is indeed displeased now, having brought the sacrifice.
3.232.20	Here they gratify him.
3.232.21	He, being pleased, carries whatever remains of the sacrifice here.
3.232.22	What Uśanā Kāvya saw, from that it is called "Uśanasa".
3.232.23	Indra, our dear friend, the conqueror of enemies, the unfathomable,
3.232.24	The mountain, the all-pervading, the extensive, the lord of heaven,
3.232.25	For he is the true Soma drinker.
3.232.26	This is the form of Rathantara.
3.232.27	This is Rathantara day.
3.232.28	"Thou art both the heaven and the earth." These indeed are the heaven and theearth.
3.232.29	He thus addresses them.
3.232.30	"Thou art Indra, the lord of the growing, in heaven." The forty-fourth day is indeed the growing day.
3.233.1	In them the Samvarta (hymn) with the final verse, the Rathantara (hymn).
3.233.2	Therefore on the Rathantara day it is performed.
3.233.3	Saṃvarta Āṅgirasa, desiring heaven, performed austerities.
3.233.4	He saw this Sama.
3.233.5	He praised with it.
3.233.6	He ascended the heavenly world, saying, "The lord of heaven, the lord of heaven."
3.233.7	As it is said, "He falls down," so it is said, "The lord of heaven."
3.233.8	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.233.9	One who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.233.10	What Angirasa Samvarta saw, from that it is called Samvarta.
3.233.11	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
3.233.12	The Asuras spread out widely.
3.233.13	Indra desired, "May I destroy the Asuras by encircling them."
3.233.14	He saw this Sama.
3.233.15	He praised with it.
3.233.16	"You are indeed the upholder of the eternal, O Indra, the ancient."
3.234.3	Among them, Dṛḍhacyuta was the Udgātṛ, Gauriviti was the Prastôtṛ, Cyutacyuta was the Pratihartṛ, Vasukṣaya was the Hotṛ, Sanaka and Sanaka were the Adhvaryus.
3.234.4	Medhātithi desired cattle, Sanaka and Navaka desired progeny, the others desired what they desired.
3.234.5	In ancient times, they used to perform the Sattra with different kinds of steps.
3.234.6	They, having obtained their respective desires, stand up.
3.234.7	Indra, assuming the form of a sheep belonging to Medhatithi, offers Soma.
3.234.8	They say, "Medhatithi's sheep is offering Soma."
3.234.9	He, having assumed his own form, offers Soma.
3.234.10-14	Then indeed they call this (animal) the sheep of Medhatithi, which is later. Medhatithi, desiring cattle, saw this Sama. He praised with it. "The young sage, the youthful, struck the Vala with the words, 'You are the Vala, the one who knows the cow, the one who is free from stones, the cave.' With this (verse) he opened the cave.
3.235.1	Then the animals were created.
3.235.2	Those who were created first are these animals of today.
3.235.3	They would have been golden-horned, two-toothed, and would have had a golden-colored tail.
3.235.4	They would also have been golden-colored, with a golden-colored garment, and would have been Apsarases.
3.235.5	The householder then thought:
3.235.6	He said, "These are mine, since you have brought them to my Gārhapatya."
3.235.7	"The householder's prosperity is indeed the best," they said.
3.235.8	"No," they said, "you were the one who desired cattle, O Asthistha!
3.235.9	These are your cattle.
3.235.10	We are the ones who desire offspring.
3.235.11	These are our offspring."
3.235.12	He then chose one of the two that were speaking.
3.235.13	She struck him.
3.235.14	She is the one whose mouth is like a mouthful.
3.235.15	Then the other one was frightened.
3.235.16	She is Hariṇikā.
3.235.17	Therefore, one should serve these animals with the knowledge of animals.
3.235.18	Then the cows with golden horns and two udders, when they were let loose, again rushed towards them. The householder did not speak the truth.
3.235.19	"We are not those who speak untruth."
3.235.20	These very same fierce bulls of today, with their horns of Vibhīnduka, are making themselves known.
3.235.21	The two Kaṇvā brothers, Medhātithi and Triśoka, competed with each other in the knowledge of the Veda.
3.235.22	They said, "Come, let us go to the burning fire."
3.235.23	They went to the burning fire.
3.235.24	Triśoka went higher and higher, while the other one went down to the ground.
3.235.25	He said, "I have won you."
3.235.26	No, said the Asura-woman, you are indeed a deity. What you have touched is not impure.
3.235.27	They said, "Come, we will cross the waters."
3.235.28	They crossed the waters by means of a chariot that was suspended.
3.235.29	"Up, up!" cried Trishoka, and he crossed. Then the other one's chariot-pole came to a halt.
3.235.30	That was the wet pole of the chariot-pole.
3.235.31	He said, "I have won you."
3.235.32	He said, "No, you are only the son of a demon."
3.235.33	Only the gods have touched you, not the demons.
3.235.34	They said, "Let us release the cattle."
3.236.1	He, Trishok, immediately released the cattle with hair and ears.
3.236.2	They were burnt here and died.
3.236.3-9	This is the reason why they say, "The cows are the salt." Therefore, one who eats meat should not eat it. Then some of them, being tormented, fled in the opposite direction. They entered the Sindhu river. It became salty. Therefore, they say, "Cows are the salt."
3.236.10	Therefore, he who makes a wager with salt, he becomes cattle.
3.236.11	Then Medhatithi, desiring cattle, spread out the year.
3.236.12	He released cattle from this very source of power, from the source of power called stone, saying, "You are the source of power of cattle."
3.236.13	This is the release of cattle. This is the Sama.
3.236.14	He who knows this becomes one who has many cattle.
3.236.15	Because Medhatithi saw this, he is called Medhatithi.
3.237.1	They say that this is the Sama of the Angirases.
3.237.2	The Angirases were the sons of the sages.
3.237.3	They desired, "May we attain the heavenly world."
3.237.4	They saw this Sama.
3.237.5	Therefore they praised.
3.237.6	Then indeed they attained the heavenly world.
3.237.7	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.237.8	He who knows this attains the heavenly world. 
3.237.9	What Angiras saw, therefore it is called the Sama of the Angirases.
3.237.10	They call it Marut.
3.237.11	The Maruts desired: "May we be the most powerful, the strongest, the most numerous, the most vigorous among the gods; may we conquer heaven."
3.237.12	They saw this Sama.
3.237.13	They praised with it.
3.237.14	Then they became the most powerful, strongest, most numerous, most vigorous among the Gods, and conquered heaven.
3.237.15	He becomes the most powerful, the strongest, the most numerous, the most heroic among his kinsmen. He conquers heaven. He who knows this.
3.237.16	What the Maruts saw, from that it is called Marut.
3.238.1	They call it Vaishvamitra.
3.238.2	The Bharatas were on the other side of the Sindhu, driven away by the Ikṣvākus.
3.238.3	In them, Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni stayed.
3.238.4	Then Indra, fearing that the two would be his advisers, asked for them.
3.238.5	He did not give them to him.
3.238.6	When they were not given to him, he cried out, "Indra is crying!"
3.238.7	Standing there, Viśvāmtara and Jamadagni said, "You two find the cows of the Ikṣvākus."
3.238.8	They heard that the two Bharatas were on the other side of the river.
3.238.9	They said, "Indra is calling us. Go and find the cattle of the Ikshvākus."
3.238.10	"We will find the cattle."
3.238.11	"They will make this river deep."
3.238.12	"You yoke them."
3.238.13	They yoked them.
3.238.14	They went.
3.238.15	They said, "Let us put aside the Pālpūlanis."
3.238.16	They put them aside.
3.238.17	Then a prince, to whom the Pālpūnani belonged, tied it to the axle.
3.238.18	They desired, "May this not be a hindrance to us."
3.238.19	Viśvāmitra saw this Sama.
3.238.20	He praised with it.
3.238.21	In the past, the young poet Bindu, of immeasurable splendor, was born.
3.238.22	Indra, the upholder of all cosmic functions, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the much-praised one,
3.238.23	You, the remover of the cave of the mountain, the possessor of strength and wealth,
3.238.24	You, whom the gods, fearing, sought out while being praised,
3.238.25	I, the hero, with your favors, have crossed the river.
3.238.26	Thus they crossed it.
3.238.27	The rivers stood up to him, the knowing ones, and the makers of his car. Indeed, the rivers stood up to them.
3.238.28	They were in the water.
3.238.29	They went beyond the water.
3.238.30	That in which this earth was floating, they indeed found the water.
3.238.31	"This is not eating," they said. They are indeed the Namshavas.
3.238.32	"The yoke is raised," they said. Those are indeed the Ayogavas.
3.238.33	This is the very place where we shall live today.' They were the first to live there.
3.239.1	And indeed, the young girls who were playing, they took.
3.239.2	That very mountain became the place of union.
3.239.3	And indeed these forests and these rivers were on this side of the Sindhu, before the Sindhu.
3.239.4	They went around to the west and stopped the eastern (rivers).
3.239.5	Then those which were the salt-water-lakes became the salt-lakes.
3.239.6	And those which remained became the small trees.
3.239.7	And then indeed these are the mountains, and these are the small trees. And those which they made to be crossed by the rivers, they became the rivers. The best of them became the rivers.
3.239.8	When they were being crossed, the ocean was displeased.
3.239.9	He said:
3.239.10	"We have heard, O Brahman, that your father was a poet."
3.239.11	"Where did you get your thousandfold strength from? Where did you get your strength from?"
3.239.12	Thus he said.
3.239.13	He said:
3.239.14	"My son, the long-suffering one, spoke in my womb,
3.239.15	The wise one was born, arranging the parts of the sacrifice."
3.239.16	"How do you know?"
3.239.17	Thus he asked.
3.239.18	Then they found those cattle.
3.239.19	This is the Pasvy (cattle-winning) Sama.
3.239.20	One who knows this obtains cattle and becomes one with many cattle.
3.239.21	Because Visvamitra saw it, it is called Vaishvamitra.
3.239.22	This is a Sama for the Idas (cattle) and the Acchhavasas.
3.239.23	Cattle are indeed Idas.
3.239.24	They indeed establish themselves in cattle.
3.240.1	The ocean is not crossed, the supreme law. The supreme horse is the supreme animal, the supreme ocean, the supreme ninth day. Therefore these are performed on the ninth day.
3.240.2	Begetting offspring, the protector of the world. They are performed with the word "begetting".
3.240.3	The form of the Jagati is begetting.
3.240.4	This is the Jagati day.
3.240.5	The bull, the purifier, on the high, pure (altar), the great Soma has grown, the great rock. The verses are full of bulls and the great. The great is the form of the great.
3.240.6	This is the great day.
3.240.7	The great Soma and the great bull have done this. For this is the great day, the forty-eighth.
3.240.8	The waters, the embryo, have chosen the gods.
3.240.9	Indra has placed the strength in Indra, the Indu has generated the light in the sun.
3.240.10	Thus they become those who are born.
3.240.11	They generate the ninth day from the morning pressing.
3.240.12	Thou seekest Vayu for the sake of sacrifice and for the sake of wealth. Thou seekest Mitra-Varuna while being purified.
3.240.13	Thou seekest the wind, thou seekest the gods, thou seekest heaven and earth, O divine Soma.
3.240.14	Thus it is dedicated to all the gods.
3.240.15	For this day is dedicated to all gods, and is of the Jāgata metre.
3.241.1	These are the verses of the Triṣṭubh metre, of the Jāgara metre, of the form of the day, and of prosperity.
3.241.2	Where they prosper by the form of the days, there they prosper.
3.241.3	He who knows this prospers.
3.241.4	This is the hymn of the god who is not to be conquered. It becomes a suitable hymn. The hymn is cattle.
3.241.5	The hymns are cattle. It is for the purpose of obtaining cattle.
3.241.6	Cattle are indeed the earth.
3.241.7	The hymn is the earth.
3.241.8	They make the cattle suitable to the cattle.
3.241.9	Here they do not make them according to the direct perception.
3.241.10	Therefore, animals give birth to different forms. A white one gives birth to a black one, and a black one gives birth to white. A reddish one gives birth to one with black spots, and one with black spots gives birth to a reddish one.
3.241.11	Among them, the names are Sama, Pra, and others. This is the immortal god, this is the god of prosperity, this is the bestower of prosperity.
3.241.12	This is the first step, this is the second, this is the third.
3.241.13	They say, "Those who perform the twelve-day sacrifice seem to fall away from this world.
3.241.14	For when they have the same beginning but different ends, they go to the end.
3.241.15	They stand in this world.
3.241.16	When they have different beginnings but the same end, they are on the sixth day.
3.241.17	They stand with them in that world.
3.242.1	It consists of ten verses. The Viraj has ten syllables.
3.242.2	Food is Viraj. For the attainment of food.
3.242.3	It consists of eight verses.
3.242.4	He thus proclaims the Stoma consisting of forty-eight verses.
3.242.5	The Gayatri has eight syllables, and animals have eight limbs.
3.242.6	Animals are the metres. For the attainment (of animals).
3.242.7	Indra indeed slew Vritra.
3.242.8	When he was about to slay Vritra, all the beings in these worlds followed him, saying, "This is a hero, this is the slayer of Vritra."
3.242.9	They placed that heroic power in him, which was to be his.
3.242.10	He who comes to this day is like one who has performed a heroic deed, like one who has slain Vritra.
3.242.11	Now, that he is called 'this' (i.e. the sacrificer), that is his strength; they place it in him as the foremost.
3.242.12	They say, the Rtu-man (seasonal) is the Pañcadaśa (Stoma), the Anrta (non-seasonal) is the Chandomas (Stoma).
3.242.13	The Chandomas are indeed established as non-seasonal, as it were.
3.242.14	Now, since these five verses are six verses, the Chandomas are performed with the intention of attaining the seasons.
3.242.15	He (the Adhvaryu) recites the six verses in the reverse order.
3.242.16	When something is directly perceived, they say, "This is so-and-so." When it is not directly perceived, they call it "that."
3.242.17	Those who come to this day proceed as if in the unseen.
3.242.18	Therefore, he becomes the best with the six-verse (hymn). By which they go.
3.242.19	By that they rise.
3.242.20	The Stoma is forty-eight.
3.242.21	The Jagati has forty-eight syllables.
3.242.22	Jagati is cattle.
3.242.23	Jagati are the Chandomas.
3.242.24	They go to cattle, to the Jagati, to the firm.
3.243.1	We have reached the most excellent one with great praise. The oblations flow.
3.243.2	Those who come on this day are as if going.
3.243.3	"He who shines, kindled, in his own abode." He shines with this.
3.243.4	"The variegated-rayed one, between the two worlds, the earth." These indeed are the two worlds, and the Maruts are this (earth).
3.243.5	"Svāhutaṃ viśvataḥ pratyaksaṃ iti, for this (day) extends towards the west.
3.243.6	Sa mahnā viśvā duritāni sāhvān iti, they become universal.
3.243.7	For this is the day of Viśve Devas.
3.243.8	Agni, we praise you, O Jātavedas,
3.243.9	May he protect us from evil, from sin, may he praise us, and may he be our benefactor."
3.243.10	Thus he invokes a blessing.
3.243.11	"Thou art Varuna, thou art Mitra, thou art Agni," it becomes Agnimārutī; for the purpose of averting evil.
3.243.12	Whatever is ill-sung, ill-praised, ill-done at the sacrifice, this is its averting.
3.243.13	"The Vasishthas increase thee with their thoughts," for this is the increasing day.
3.243.14	May your gifts be most excellent. May you always protect us with your blessings." Thus he blesses with this verse.
3.244.1	" "The verse, "May we be protected by Mitra-Varuna," is for the Maitravaruna priest.
3.244.2	" "Let the Stoma come forth, the shining one.
3.244.3	" "To the mighty-born ones, bowing down.
3.244.4	" Thus it is in the plural.
3.244.5	They generate the ninth day with this verse.
3.244.6	The gods who hold it, thus for firmness.
3.244.7	For now they are going to the end of the Vedic texts, lest they should go beyond the prescribed limit.
3.244.8	The very skillful, the fathers of skill,
3.244.9	To the Asura, the great,
3.244.10	May they, the protectors of our wealth, the protectors of the body, the Varuna, the patrons of the singers,
3.244.11	May Mitra and Varuna accomplish our thoughts.
3.244.12	Thus for success.
3.244.13	Indra, the great, who is powerful, is the lord of the Indra-s.
3.244.14	This is the great day, the forty-eighth.
3.244.15	Like Parjanya, the rain-giver,
3.244.16	he has grown with the Stotras of the calf.
3.244.17	Thus this day has grown.
3.244.18	The Kanvas, when they performed the Indra-s, with the Stotras, the means of accomplishing the sacrifice, it is indeed accomplished.
3.244.19	"The offspring of truth is shining forth." The word "janat" is used in the sense of "people".
3.244.20	From the ninth day they generate the tenth day.
3.244.21	The tenth day is generated from the ninth day.
3.244.22	What is Indra-Agni on the second day, that is Indra-Agna on the tenth day. It is Barhaspatya.
3.244.23	Because this day is Barhaspatyam.
3.244.24	The offerings of clarified butter are simultaneous.
3.244.25	Now, indeed, these two are like two villages, namely, the Pañcadaśa and the Ṣaḍaha.
3.244.26	Just as two villages, having made friends with each other, would be safe from fear, so it is when the offerings of clarified butter are similar.
3.244.27	Some make them dissimilar.
3.244.28	Therefore they should be made similar. The Stoma is forty-eight.
3.244.29	The Jagati has forty-eight syllables.
3.244.30	The Jagati is the cattle.
3.244.31	The cattle are the Chandomas.
3.244.32	They go to the cattle, to the Jagati, to the firm ones.
3.245.1	"The Pavamana is the destroyer of the enemies," (said) in the form of the Brihat, "the bright ones are the Chandas," (said) for the Jagati.
3.245.2	Pavamana is the best of chariots, the most brilliant, the most praised.
3.245.3	The bright-coloured Maruts are the bright-coloured Chandas.
3.245.4	Thus they are Marutvatī verses.
3.245.5	The form of the midday is indeed Marutvat.
3.245.6	They do not go beyond the form of the midday itself.
3.245.7	They approach the form of the Vaishvadev (verses) - "O Pavamāna, do thou attain."
3.245.8	For the Vaishvadeva day is indeed this (day).
3.245.9	They are Ghnadvati verses.
3.245.10	The ninth day is the end.
3.245.11	Having come to the end, they destroy all evil by means of these (verses).
3.245.12	In them, the Gayatri verse is as mentioned in the Brahmana.
3.245.13	Then the Gatuvinnidhana (verses).
3.245.14	They perform the Sattra with the intention, "We shall find the Gatu."
3.245.15	They indeed find the Gatu.
3.245.16	It becomes the upper one, the Baharata with the Nidhana outside.
3.245.17	Therefore it is performed on the Baharata day.
3.245.18	They call it the "Gift of Bharadvaja".
3.245.19	The Kshatra (warrior class) was Pratardana. Ten kings surrounded the king of Dasara in the human world.
3.245.20	Bharadvaja was his priest.
3.245.21	The sages approached him, saying, "We run to you."
3.245.22	"Know us here."
3.245.23	Bharadvaaja desired, "May we win the battle."
3.245.24	He saw this Sama Veda.
3.245.25	Therefore he praised.
3.245.26	He said, "Having praised, Indra will come to the call."
3.245.27	"We will win this battle."
3.246.1	Then there was a good-natured woman named Upamā, the wife of Prātadanas, the king.
3.246.2	Her brother was killed by him.
3.246.3	That was the Dhūvana.
3.246.4	Indra caught her as she was running away.
3.246.5	He put on a dry antelope skin and went to him.
3.246.6	In the middle of the sacrifice, he placed a cake in one half and a mixture of curds and ghee in the other half.
3.246.7	He then decided to dance near him.
3.246.8	They smeared her with ghee.
3.246.9	When he pushed her away, she danced right in front of him.
3.246.10	In this way, the day passed.
3.246.11	His husband asked her, "Did you see anything here?"
3.246.12	She replied, "Nothing else, but the old man only came near me."
3.246.13	At his death, the cake was attached to one half of the milk-rice, and the butter was attached to the other half.
3.246.14	He who had been banished by him, went to the side of Mathamedi and became free from distress.
3.246.15	He said, "Indeed Indra did not come to the call.
3.246.16	We shall win this battle.
3.247.1	He was indeed Indra. You should have honoured him. Having made him your friend, you should have said, 'We shall win the battle.'
3.247.2	The next day they assembled.
3.247.3	He then began to dance in a manner more difficult than before.
3.247.4	And when he was about to do something, the other one did something more difficult than before,
3.247.5	and he said to himself, "I will make him speak."
3.247.6	And he spoke to him,
3.247.7	"What is your trick?"
3.247.8	"What is it?"
3.247.9	"What has been invented by the imaginary men?"
3.247.10	Thus Indra.
3.247.11	May your mind be like that of the great one, the winner of many prizes.
3.247.12	This is a Vedic simile.
3.247.13	If the son were to die, the father would grieve for him.
3.247.14	This is Indra.
3.247.15	May your mind be like poison, like a snake that has just shed its skin.
3.247.16	This is the Vedic simile.
3.247.17	The son was killed by the poison, and the father killed the deer with it.
3.247.18	This is what Indra said.
3.247.19	The other, the son, runs along the path that is favorable to him.
3.247.20	This is a Vedic simile.
3.247.21	And the other, the father, runs along the favorable path for his son.
3.247.22	This is Indra.
3.247.23	My beloved husband touches me with his hand, and then
3.247.24	This is a Veda simile.
3.247.25	You should have done this, you should have done that.
3.247.26	What happened? What happened?
3.247.27	How did the dear one become dear to you? Then he touched him with his hand.
3.247.28	This is Indra.
3.247.29	It was so, then it was so.
3.247.30	How did the dear one became dear to you? He touched him with his hands.
3.247.31	This is indeed Indra.
3.247.32	It happened so, then it happened so.
3.247.33	How was the dear one dear to you? You touched him with your hands.
3.247.34	This was a simile from the Veda.
3.248.1	He then said to him, "Let us win the battle."
3.248.2	He, while putting on his armour, said:
3.248.3	"As these stars fall down, shining."
3.248.4	Thus the enemies of the Kshatriya fall down from among men.
3.248.5	He then shaved off the hair of the Eneyas.
3.248.6	They then stood up as horses and chariots.
3.248.7	With them he won that battle.
3.248.8	He said, "My semen is not in my wife."
3.248.9	What Bharadvaja said, "My seed is not in my woman," that is the meaning of "not in the woman."
3.248.10	This is the victory, the conquest of the enemy.
3.248.11	It destroys the enemy, the hater. It causes the enemy, the one who hates, to be in the woman. It does not cause the woman to run with the enemy.
3.248.12	Then indeed it is with Indra.
3.248.13	Indra alone went to this call of theirs; he who knows thus goes to the call of Indra.
3.248.14	It has eight syllables and a gift of eight. The Gayatri has eight syllables.
3.248.15	Animals have eight limbs.
3.248.16	Animals are the metres; for the securing of animals.
3.248.17	Because Bharadvaja saw it, therefore it is called the "source of Bharadvaja's wealth."
3.249.1	Now about Saindhukṣita.
3.249.2	Saindhukṣita saw the end of speech.
3.249.3	They attain speech through the metres.
3.249.4	Now speech becomes like a friend in the metres.
3.249.5	They attain it.
3.249.6-12	Then with the last Sāman we shall attain the last heavenly world." That is the Iḍa. Cattle are Iḍa. Cattle are the Chandomas. For the securing of cattle. Then the Harishri-ni-dhanam. In the beginning, indeed, Shri was in Prajapati. Indra desired, "May this Shri which is in Prajapati be in me."
3.249.13	He saw this Sama.
3.249.14	He praised with it.
3.249.15	With it, he took away the prosperity of Prajapati.
3.249.16	That is the reason for the name "Harishri-nidhana".
3.249.17	This is the prosperity of the Savasama.
3.249.18	One who knows this attains prosperity.
3.249.19	The gods and the demons competed.
3.249.20	Among them, prosperity was equally distributed.
3.249.21	He Indra desired, "May I seize the glory of the Asuras."
3.249.22	He saw this Sama.
3.249.23	With it he seized the glory of the Asurs, indeed, the glory of the Haris.
3.249.24	That is the reason for the name Harishrinidhana.
3.249.25	This is indeed the glory of the Sama.
3.249.26	One who knows this attains glory, seizes the glory of the hated enemy.
3.249.27	It is of three syllables, for these three worlds are of three syllables, and for the maintenance of these worlds.
3.250.1	Now the Niviṣṭha of the Angirases.
3.250.2	The Angirases desired, "May we obtain cattle."
3.250.3	They saw this Sama.
3.250.4	They praised with it.
3.250.5	Then from all directions the cattle approached them.
3.250.6	They said, "We have not yet crossed the Iḍā."
3.250.7	The Iḍā is indeed cattle.
3.250.8	Therefore, there is a crossing of the Iḍā.
3.250.9	Then the Bābhra, the Gvāmi, the Bahīniṣṭha, and the Bāhrata.
3.250.10	Therefore, it is performed on the Bāhrta day.
3.250.11	Bābhru of the Kumbhas desired, "May I be prosperous with cattle."
3.250.12	He saw this Sama.
3.250.13	He praised with it.
3.250.14	It has the Nidhana (verse) "He is indeed the one with the cows."
3.250.15	From that he became endowed with cattle.
3.250.16	This is the cattle-bestowing Sama.
3.250.17	One who knows this obtains cattle and becomes one with many cattle.
3.250.18	Because Babhru saw it in the pots, therefore it is called Babhruva.
3.250.19	Now the bull Pavamāna.
3.250.20	The animals are the Sīmas, the animals are the Revatis, the animals are bulls.
3.250.21	They indeed release the bull among the animals for the sake of union and procreation.
3.250.22	He who knows this is born with a mate.
3.250.23	And indeed all the metres are made to have bulls by this one.
3.251.1	Then the Gausukti, the Bahisnihana, the Barhaspatya.
3.251.2	From that the Barhaspatyam is performed on the Barhaspaty day.
3.251.3	The Gausukti and the Asvasukti are these two.
3.251.4	They, having received much, were like two grumblers.
3.251.5	They desired, "We shall destroy this grumble."
3.251.6	They saw these two Samans.
3.251.7	May they be the two of them.
3.251.8	One of them, Agni, was offered in this world.
3.251.9	In this world, Agni is not exceeded by anything.
3.251.10	The other one, Shukra, was offered in the other world.
3.251.11	In the other world, the sun is not exceeded by any thing.
3.251.12	Then they both drank the poison.
3.251.13	Then they had the same pain as a young boy with two teeth.
3.251.14	One who thinks he has drunk poison, but has not drunk it, and eats food without being invited, should praise them.
3.251.15	He will be freed from the poison.
3.251.16	Whatever evil this one has done, that he removes.
3.251.17	They are the five-syllabled treasure, for the Paṅkti has five feet.
3.251.18	Cattle are the Paṅkti.
3.251.19	The metres are cattle, for the securing of cattle.
3.251.20	The reason why the verses are called "Gausūkta" and "Aśvasūkta" is that they were seen by them.
3.252.1	"He who is surrounded, sprinkles the Soma" - the verses are called Parivati because they are the form of the end.
3.252.2	Because this is the last day.
3.252.3	"Soma who is the highest offering" - because this is the highest offering made, namely the Chandomas.
3.252.4	The one who has the bow, who has given birth to Soma in the waters, with the mountains.
3.252.5	Certainly, being purified, flowing around with the cows, the most fragrant,
3.252.6	Having been pressed, we enjoy the Soma in the waters with the juice.
3.252.7	Thus they become those who have the juice. The juice is food. For the securing of food.
3.252.8-12	Those who praise with cows, the northern (cows), are cow-rich, cattle-rich. They become so for the purpose of securing cattle. For cattle are the metres. The one with four verses, 'Thou art the guardian of thy own, the god-winner, the sacrifice, the moon, the discerning', is for cattle. Cattle are the metres. For the purpose of securing animals. In them is the Prstha.
3.252.13-20	The gods became the back by means of the back. They sit at the sacrifice, saying, "We have become the back." They indeed become the back. The gods desired, "Let us become the back." They saw this Sama. They praised with it. Then indeed they became the back. This Agni is the back of this world, this Vayu is the back of the atmosphere, this Aditya is the back of heaven.
3.252.21	That is the back, indeed, they praise here, and they establish it.
3.252.22	That is the back, the glory, indeed, is the back.
3.252.23	He who knows this attains glory, becomes the back.
3.252.24	That is above, the form of the great, on the great day.
3.252.25	By that, indeed, the form is enriched.
3.253.1	Then about Samkriti.
3.253.2	By the three-day (rite), indeed, the gods went upward to the heavenly world.
3.253.3	He was not included in these (sacrifices). He was excluded.
3.253.4	They made him equal by means of the Gayatra side, by means of the Udattas, by means of Shatanis, by means of Samtanis, by means means of Samkrtin, by means of Trisandhi, by means of Sraayantiya, by means of Arista, they made him equal to the Arista.
3.253.5	By means of the three-night (sacrifice) the gods went to the heavenly world. They went by this.
3.253.6	He is the one who is separated from them.
3.253.7	In him, these many Sāmans are performed.
3.253.8	They perform this Trirātra for healing.
3.253.9	They perform the expiation for healing.
3.253.10	The gods made the creatures, animals, prosperity, and food by means of Sankrtis.
3.253.11	That is why they are called Sankrtis.
3.253.12	He who knows this, makes his subjects, cattle, prosperity, and food.
3.253.13	His are these two kinds of barking dogs, both of the village and of the forest, for the attainment of both kinds of speech.
3.253.14	It has four ends, because animals have four feet.
3.253.15	The Chandomas are animals, for the securing of animals.
3.254.1	Now the Kounmalabariṣa.
3.254.2	By this (hymn) Kumnalabarhi obtained both kinds of cattle, cows and horses.
3.254.3	By this (hymn), he obtains them.
3.254.4	Kumnalabarhi desired, 'May I obtain both kinds of cattle - cows and horses.'
3.254.5	He saw this Sama.
3.254.6	He praised with it.
3.254.7	For you are the one who comes and knows the wealth for prosperity.
3.254.8	Pour down, O Maghavan, for cattle and horses. Pour down, O Indra, for horses.
3.254.9	Thus he obtained cattle and horses.
3.254.10	Having worshipped with those animals, he went to heaven.
3.254.11	This is the animal-oriented and heavenly Sama.
3.254.12	He who knows this, conquers cattle and goes to heaven.
3.254.13	Because he saw the Kumnalabarhi, therefore it is called Kumnalabarhis.
3.255.1	Now the place of the gods.
3.255.2	By this third three-day (rite) the gods went upwards to heaven.
3.255.3	This (rite) was not included in their (rites). The Vivasvat (rite) fell down.
3.255.4	They saw this Sama.
3.255.5	He established him in this, he established him in this.
3.255.6	He established him with this very (verse).
3.255.7	In that he established him with this, that is the reason why the Devashthana is called Devashthana.
3.255.8	In that there is Devashthana here, they establish this three-day (rite) in him, they establish him.
3.255.9	Having arranged it, he went to the heavenly world.
3.255.10	Whatever was established in that heavenly world, that itself is the state of the gods.
3.255.11	When they went to the heavenly worlds, he made everything here a sacrifice so that it would be destroyed.
3.255.12	By this hymn, one conquers the great and invincible.
3.255.13	This is its verse:
3.255.14	The gods, having agreed upon the form of Vairaupa, remained in it, and that became their own.
3.255.15	Having again ascended, they shook all the bodies to dust, saying "Hink!"
3.255.16	Thus it is said.
3.255.17	Having thus arranged the three days of the Chandomi, and having ascended the Sama of Devashthana, they went to the heavenly world.
3.255.18	This is the verse on it:
3.255.19	When the gods were defeated in the battle, they stood together, uttering the sound "hiṅ" (at the beginning of the hymn).
3.255.20	They created the divine abode, the Sāman, by which the gods attained immortality.
3.255.21	Thus they attained immortality.
3.256.1	Prajapati created food.
3.256.2	Fearing its destruction, it fled to the directions.
3.256.3	He desired, "May I obtain food."
3.256.4	He saw this Sama.
3.256.5	By that he became established, he became established. Thus he obtained food from all directions.
3.256.6	One who desires food should recite four times.
3.256.7	There are four directions.
3.256.8	He obtains food from the directions.
3.256.9	Now he who desires heaven should say this three times. These are the three worlds. For the attainment of these worlds.
3.256.10	Now the wild flower is food. The sun is food.
3.256.11	Its flower is what is wild.
3.256.12	It grows in the forest, for the attainment of the food of the forest.
3.256.13	The gods, desiring heaven, practiced austerities.
3.256.14	They saw these two Sāmans.
3.256.15	They praised with them.
3.256.16	Then indeed they attained the heavenly world.
3.256.17	These two are the heavenly Sāmans. 
3.256.18	He who knows this attains the heavenly world. 
3.256.19	Just as when it rains, one sees the stream, so indeed one sees the heavenly world through these two.
3.256.20	These two indeed are heavenly.
3.256.21	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.257.1	Then about Dirghashravas. Food is Dirghashrava. For the securing of food.
3.257.2	The eldest son of Mamateya, Dirghtama, said to his younger brother Dirghashravan, "Let you be the overseer of these our wives."
3.257.3	He desired, "May I be able to provide food for my wife and not let them go hungry."
3.257.4	He saw this Sama.
3.257.5	He praised Agni with it.
3.257.6	"He who bestows all wealth, the Hotar, the sweet one of people,
3.257.7	The first vessels of honey are for him. May praises go to Agni.
3.257.8	Thus."
3.257.9	He, Agni, praised by us, made all this food and drink sweet.
3.257.10	They were his wives, as if eating honey.
3.257.11	This is indeed a great taste, a great food.
3.257.12	By this Samaveda, one obtains a great food.
3.257.13	Because Dirghatamas saw it, it is called Dirghatamas.
3.258.1	Now about Yashas.
3.258.2	The gods became famous through Yashas.
3.258.3	They sit in the sacrifice saying, "We will become famous."
3.258.4	They become famous.
3.258.5	That is indeed fame.
3.258.6	One who knows this attains fame.
3.258.7	It consists of thirty-seven syllables.
3.258.8	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
3.258.9	The Brihatī is the heavenly world.
3.258.10	That is the sun, consisting of thirty-seven.
3.258.11	They indeed find their final resting place in that heavenly world.
3.258.12	He then wishes for him this auspicious blessing: "May he live long, may he live for all time, may we live for all time."
3.258.13	By that very (gift) he prospers and attains the goal.
3.258.14	Now the price.
3.258.15	By the price the gods became the price.
3.258.16	They sit in a sacrifice saying, "The price is there."
3.258.17	They become the price itself.
3.258.18	That is indeed the price of prosperity.
3.258.19	He who knows this attains prosperity.
3.258.20	They indeed call it the price.
3.258.21	The gods, desiring heaven, practised austerities.
3.258.22	They saw this Sama.
3.258.23	They praised with it.
3.258.24	Then they attained heaven.
3.258.25	This is the Sama for heaven.
3.258.26	He who knows this attains heaven.
3.258.27	Then Bharga.
3.258.28	The gods became bright through Bharga.
3.258.29	They sit in the sacrifice saying, "We are bright."
3.258.30	The gods are indeed Bhṛgu.
3.258.31	Bhṛgu is indeed prosperity.
3.258.32	One who knows this attains prosperity.
3.258.33	Now the Abhiśava for the purpose of both being Abhiśava.
3.258.34	Just as one would go with one Abhiśava, so it is when one is Abhiśava. Then as one would go when both are Abhiśava, it is when both are Abhiṣava.
3.258.35	With these two, the twelve-night sacrifice is taken up without harm.
3.258.36	He who knows this, crosses over sin in twelve nights, and attains prosperity, by the one seized by Arishta.
3.259.1	Then there is the long-shadowed sun, the sun is food, for the attainment of food.
3.259.2	The sage Mamateya, desiring food, practiced austerities.
3.259.3	He saw this Sama.
3.259.4	He praised with it.
3.259.5	Then he obtained food.
3.259.6	This is the obtaining of food.
3.259.7	He who knows this obtains food, becomes the best among his kinsmen.
3.259.8	Because Dirghatamas saw him, therefore he is called Dirghatamas Arka.
3.259.9	The Soma is the bull, the red, the tawny, the tawny-coloured ones, the form of the great one.
3.259.10	This is the Barhaspatya day.
3.259.11	Like a king, the strong one, he roared over the cows.
3.259.12	Purifying, he has gone beyond the imperishable, the hawk has approached the ghee-bearing one, the unborn one.
3.259.13	Parjanya is the father of the tawny-coloured bull, the lord of the earth, who has placed his body in the mountains.
3.259.14	The waters, his sisters, have come up to the cows, dwelling together with the stones, at the sacrifice.
3.259.15	Thus they become cows and animals, for the securing of animals.
3.259.16	For animals are the metres.
3.259.17	The poet seeks the great power of the Veda, the horse, the one who is filled, flows forth to the prize.
3.259.18	O Soma, thou who art filled with ghee, thou who art clothed in ghee, thou who goest around the purifying (waters), thou who art the remover of evil, be gracious to us.
3.259.19	Thus the Parvati (verses) are (sung). They are the form of the end.
3.259.20	For this is the last day.
3.260.1	On them the Sama-raja (verses).
3.260.2	The kingdom is prosperity.
3.260.3	He who knows this attains prosperity, goes to the kingdom.
3.260.4-9	They call it 'Samvatsara' (year). The gods went to heaven by the path of the wind, and fell down by the path of water. They attained heaven by the path (of the wind) of the year. In that these are the (hymns) of the year, they go to heaven by the wind, they fall down by the water, they attain heaven by the path, of the year. They are the (hymn) of the year.
3.260.10	They desire speech with the metres.
3.260.11	Now indeed speech becomes attained.
3.260.12	In the metres it is. In that these are the ends of speech, they indeed attain that very speech directly.
3.261.1	Then the Brihat.
3.261.2	The Brihat is indeed the armour.
3.261.3	They indeed go to the armour, being established.
3.261.4	That is the Jagatī (verse) for the day.
3.261.5	This is the form of the male, the Jagatī for the female.
3.261.6	That it has a large back here, by that this day is made to be a couple.
3.261.7	Then the Vamadevya.
3.261.8	The Vamadevya is indeed cattle.
3.261.9	Those who praise with it become cattle-owners.
3.261.10	All the Indras' feasts, as it were, approach the sun, they become universal.
3.261.11	For this is the day of Visvedevas.
3.261.12	The Vasus, the sons, the offspring, the strength, they become the people.
3.261.13	The form of the Jagati is people.
3.261.14	This is the Jagata day.
3.261.15	Each one has his own share.
3.261.16	Praise the Atithi, the giver of wealth, the good ones are the guests of Indra.
3.261.17	He who does not disobey his wish, urging the mind to give.
3.261.18	Thus he blesses himself with this.
3.262.1	Among them, this is the Srayantiya (hymn).
3.262.2	The gods, while performing the Sattra sacrifice, said, "Let us remove whatever is harmful to ourselves."
3.262.3	"Let not the fierce ones come near!"
3.262.4	Whatever was fierce in them, they fashioned and placed in the two jars.
3.262.5	Then they began the sacrifice.
3.262.6	Then this entire god was born.
3.262.7	That he was born from the two jars, that is his name.
3.262.8	This indeed is the Agni who was born.
3.262.9	He does not injure him who knows this.
3.262.10	He said to the gods, "Who generated me?"
3.262.11	They said, "To the one who sees from a distance, he who transgresses, he is killed."
3.262.12	Prajapati desired his own daughter.
3.262.13	She stood before him in the form of a red cow.
3.262.14	He ascended her in the form of an antelope.
3.262.15	He thought, "The gods have indeed generated me for the purpose of seeing.
3.262.16	He is indeed exceeding the boundaries. Let me strike him down."
3.262.17	He struck him.
3.262.18	Having been struck, he assumed this form and emerged upwards.
3.263.1	That is the arrow with three joints.
3.263.2	Therefore, the flesh of a deer is the sweetest.
3.263.3	Therefore, one grieves as if.
3.263.4	The semen of the one who was struck fell down.
3.263.5	It was established in the Himalayas.
3.263.6	It became human.
3.263.7	The gods and the sages, having assembled, said, "This is the fat of the wicked."
3.263.8	Because they said, "This fat of the wicked," that is why it is called "the fat of the wicked" (māduṣa).
3.263.9	Indeed, this is the name of Māduṣa.
3.263.10	It is known as "human."
3.263.11	They enkindled it with Agni.
3.263.12	The Maruts have made it inferior.
3.263.13	They made it inferior with the Sraiyantiya (hymn).
3.263.14	That is why the Sraiyantiyas are called Sraiyantiyas.
3.263.15	Then animals were created.
3.263.16	Those that were created first were red.
3.263.17	Those that came out when they were being heated were tawny.
3.263.18	Those that emerged when they were heated were black.
3.263.19-21	Those who were born from the burning (fire) were white and black. Therefore, this very fire burns both white and black. The goats and sheep were born from the sparks, and the Angirasas from the embers.
3.264.1	From the ashes mixed with charcoal, three kinds of cattle were produced, belonging to Mitra-Varuna, to Brhaspati, and to Visve Dev.
3.264.2	From the ashes was produced the donkey.
3.264.3	Therefore he is similar to ashes.
3.264.4	Therefore he lives when being burnt.
3.264.5	This is the generating of heroes, the cattle-producing Sāman.
3.264.6	The heroes were born from that which was the Angiras.
3.264.7	These are the animals that were created.
3.264.8	He who knows this, his hero is born, he wins cattle, he becomes one with many cattle.
3.264.9	He for whom there is a break in the sacrifice, for him they should perform the Brahma-sāman on the back-verses.
3.264.10	He who has a break in the sacrificial session, he is deprived of the back-verses and the praises.
3.264.11	And in the Stotras they establish him in the rear.
3.264.12	From where, O Indra, we fear, from that make us free from fear.
3.264.13	O Maghavan, be gracious to us, for that is thy boon. Destroy the foes and the wicked.
3.264.14	Thus they destroy evil and sin by this (verse).
3.264.15	The entire Brāhmaṇa is recited in them.
3.264.16	This is the Iḍa-acchavāka-sāman.
3.264.17	The Iḍā is indeed the animals.
3.264.18	They indeed establish themselves in the animals.
3.265.1	"Thou art Soma, the supporter," for support.
3.265.2	For now they go to the end, lest they should go beyond the metres.
3.265.3	"Thou, O Soma, art the most intoxicating," they become intoxicating. The juice is indeed intoxication.
3.265.4	The third pressing is indeed like a son.
3.265.5	Whatever these (verses) are with the word 'madhu', they put that juice into it.
3.265.6	They thus nourish it with this.
3.265.7	'You, O Suswan, with the mountains' - 'you' is the form of the great one.
3.265.8	This is the great day.
3.265.9	Flow forth, O thundering one,
3.265.10	The bright, shining, supreme
3.265.11	Thus this is the best of the three-day sacrifices, which are the Soma sacrifices.
3.265.12	They are similar in the beginning, but different in the end.
3.265.13	This is the first step, this is the second, this is the third.
3.265.14	They say, "Those who perform the twelve-day sacrifice seem to fall away from this world, as if they were going to the end.
3.265.15	Now, when they are of the same kind at the beginning and different in the middle, they are established in this world.
3.265.16	When they are of different kinds at the beginning and the same in the middle, then they are established in the sixth day.
3.265.17	They are established in the other world.
3.265.18	In them, the Gayatri is as explained in the Brahmanas.
3.265.19	Then the Nidhanas of the Eda, the Bahis, and the Barhaspatya.
3.265.20	From that the Barhaspatyam is performed on the Barhaspaty day.
3.265.21	Indeed, there was a sage named Asu, who was without cattle.
3.265.22	He desired, "May I obtain cattle."
3.265.23	He saw this Sama.
3.265.24	He praised with it.
3.265.25	He attained the Nidhana as "This is Vasu."
3.265.26	That is the reason why it is called the 'Eḍāvasuni-dhana'.
3.265.27	Cattle indeed are wealth.
3.265.28	From that he won cattle.
3.265.29	That is the cattle-winning Sāman.
3.265.30	He who knows this wins cattle, becomes a great cattle-owner.
3.265.31	It has four verses, for cattle have four feet.
3.265.32	The animals are the metres; for the securing of animals.
3.266.1	Now, the Kāsītam.
3.266.2	At the Sattra, Sūbara found out the disease.
3.266.3	He desired, 'May I destroy the disease.'
3.266.4	He saw this Sama.
3.266.5	He praised with it.
3.266.6	May the wind blow, the healing, the auspicious, the nourishing, in our hearts.
3.266.7	May it lead our lives.
3.266.8	Whatever nectar-like treasure there is in your house, O Wind,
3.266.9	give it to us for life.
3.266.10	O Wind, you are our father, brother, friend,
3.266.11	make us live.
3.266.12	Wind itself did this for him.
3.266.13	This is the remedy they perform as atonement.
3.266.14	This is indeed the fulfillment of desire. He desired this.
3.266.15	That desire is fulfilled for him.
3.266.16	If one praises with this Sama, that desire is fulfilled for one.
3.266.17	They offer the Ida in the opposite direction, so that they do not go beyond the metres. The Ida is cattle.
3.266.18	The metres are cattle. It is for the sake of securing cattle.
3.266.19	What Kasi-tis Sauvaras saw, therefore it is called Kasita.
3.266.20	Now the Asva-sutra, with the explanation of the Brahmanas.
3.266.21	It has five syllables and is the destroyer of wealth. The Panka is five-footed.
3.266.22	Animals are Panka.
3.266.23	Animals are the Chandomas. For the sake of securing animals.
3.266.24	Now the Shammala, with the explanation in the Brahmanas.
3.266.25	Now the explanation of the Brāhmaṇa, which has been spoken. The explanation of the oblation.
3.266.26	It consists of four verses, because animals have four feet.
3.266.27	Animals are the metres; for the securing of animals.
3.266.28	"Thou art the divine Anga." The word "tvam" (thou) is the form of the Brihatī.
3.266.29	This is the Brihatī day.
3.266.30	Pavamana, the most brilliant of the generations, (thus) the verses are in pairs.
3.266.31	The form of the Jagati is in pairs.
3.266.32	This is the Jagata day.
3.266.33	In them, the Sauparna Brahmana is spoken.
3.266.34	Flow, O Pavamana, for the divine assembly, thus it becomes for all the gods.
3.266.35	For this is the Vaishvadeva day, the Jagata.
3.266.36	Your steeds, O Indra, have grown for the sake of your intoxication, for the sake of the draught. For the day is indeed growing.
3.266.37	"Come to us, O Indra, the drops of Soma!" They come to him. For the sake of non-crossing.
3.267.1	In them the Vaisvamanasa (hymn).
3.267.2	The Rks found the departed Samiddhara in the forest.
3.267.3	He desired, "May I kill the Rks."
3.267.4	He saw this Sama.
3.267.5	He sang it.
3.267.6	Indra saw him, the one with universal mind. The Rk-s saw him.
3.267.7	He rushed at him.
3.267.8	When he rushed at him, he was exhausted and fell down.
3.267.9	He asked the one with universal knowledge, "Who is this one beyond you?"
3.267.10	He said, "Tell me, O Maghavan, who is this one beyond me?"
3.267.11	He said to him, "O Maghavan, the one beyond me is the one who is beyond the one beyond me."
3.267.12-17	He said, "Strike them with the stick." "Having cut the grass, slowly place it down." Having cut the grass he slowly placed it down. Indra himself sprinkled that very grass. He struck his enemy with that very grass. That is the weapon, the destroyer of enemies, the destroyer of demons.
3.267.18	He destroys the enemy, the foe, the demon, the evil one. He who knows this, destroys the enemy, foe, demon, evil one.
3.267.19	Because he saw everything, therefore it is called Vaishvamanas.
3.268.1	"The verses are: "The lord, the swift, the tawny," and so on. They are of varying length, because this day is the last."
3.268.2	This day is the last.
3.268.3	They purify the tawny one with the Varana.
3.268.4	He who knows the gods as everything,
3.268.5	Thus the verses of Viśvavasu are recited.
3.268.6	For this day is indeed dedicated to Viśvavasus.
3.268.7	They go with Madhu, hence they are called Madvatis.
3.268.8	They thus place the juice and Madhu in the third pressing.
3.268.9	Twice the sisters, the five, the well-praised, the mountain-bound,
3.268.10	The dear, the desirable, the waves bathe Indra.
3.268.11	Thus he blesses himself with this.
3.268.12	"He pours (the Soma) for Indra, the drinker of Soma, the slayer of Vritra, saying, "For Indra, the drinker, the slayer of Vrtra," they are the slayer of Vrtras, for victory at the end.
3.268.13	In them is the hymn to the cow, as explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.268.14	Now the Nihava.
3.268.15	Indra, being disgusted with the third pressing, departed.
3.268.16	It was as if he had been cheated.
3.268.17	The All-gods invoked him with this hymn, saying, "Come, come."
3.268.18	Then Indra returned to the third pressing.
3.268.19	Then he became irrepressible from it.
3.268.20	This is the hymn with Indra.
3.268.21	He whose sacrifice is with Indra and the gods becomes successful.
3.268.22	Indra approaches his sacrifice.
3.268.23	Indra does not depart from the sacrifice of him who knows this.
3.268.24	They indeed call it the invocation of Vasishtha.
3.268.25	Vasishtha, having lost his son in battle, desired: "May I invoke offspring and cattle."
3.268.26	He saw this Sama.
3.268.27	He praised with it.
3.268.28	With it he invoked offspring and cattle, saying, "Come, come."
3.268.29	That is the Nihav-ness.
3.268.30	He who knows this, makes his offspring and cattle cry out.
3.268.31	That is the Stobha-ness.
3.268.32	From the Stobha-less are offspring and cattle born.
3.268.33	The Chandomas are cattle.
3.268.34	By that one attains perfection of form.
3.268.35	Because Vasishtha saw it, therefore it is called the Nihav of Vasishtha.
3.269.1	Now, as for the Vāhisthīya (hymn).
3.269.2	Agni did not wish to carry the oblation from the ninth to the tenth day.
3.269.3	The gods desired, "May Agni not carry this oblation."
3.269.4	They saw this Sama.
3.269.5	They praised him with it.
3.269.6	"What is the most excellent, that to Agni, the great, the luminous,
3.269.7	Your wealth is like a buffalo, your steeds rise up.
3.269.8	Your bright hymns are like a stone, they are proclaimed like thunder.
3.269.9	And your praises are like the clouds, as they are from heaven.
3.269.10	Thus we have praised Agni, the giver of wealth, the benefactor.
3.269.11	He, the wise one, has protected us from all enemies, like a boat.
3.269.12	Thus it is said.
3.269.13	Just as a boat crosses over, so Agni crosses over this oblation from the ninth to the tenth day.
3.269.14	He alone is worthy of crossing over here.
3.269.15	What is the most excellent here, it is for the continuity of the sacrifice.
3.269.16	The sacrifice prospers for him. Agni crosses over the oblation for him who knows this.
3.269.17	Then it becomes the form of the great one, on the great day.
3.269.18	By that, the form is enriched.
3.270.1	Then the black one.
3.270.2	The sages said, "Let us conquer this upper heaven, the world of heaven, in which these Atharvaṇas are."
3.270.3	Prāṇī, Saubhāhita, Madhuccanda, Vaiśvāmītra, Asita, Daivāla, and others who have approached him, they did not hear the prayers of the sacrificers for many years.
3.270.4	They heard the prayers of those who call out and offer the Vasat-call.
3.270.5	He then ascended the cup-bearer of the Atharvaṇas, named Udvanta.
3.270.6	He said to them, "What is your desire?"
3.270.7	"We desire to conquer this upper heaven, the world of heaven, in which these Atharvaṇs are."
3.270.8	He said to him, "Go to the village with your back."
3.270.9	"This one."
3.270.10	"For what desire?"
3.270.11	"For the path."
3.270.12	"He said, 'Is not that which is yours heavenly?'
3.270.13	Then he looked at the vessel.
3.270.14	He said, 'Eat the meat.'
3.270.15	They said, 'We will eat.'
3.270.16	For what desire?'
3.270.17	For the eyes and the vital airs.'
3.270.18	He said, ‘That which is yours is indeed heavenly.’
3.270.19	Then he looked only at the vessel.
3.270.20	He said, "Go away, you are a woman."
3.270.21	"We will go," he said.
3.270.22	"For what desire?"
3.270.23	"For progeny, for continuity, for non-interruption."
3.270.24	He said, "That is not your heavenly."
3.270.25	Then he made the cup itself the answer.
3.270.26	He said, "Speak untruth."
3.270.27	"We will speak," he said.
3.270.28	"For what desire?"
3.270.29	Whether for the sake of a woman, or for the sake of sport, or for the friendship of a friend.
3.270.30	He said, "Oṃ."
3.271.1	"Rise up and tell me your desires. I will not be angry with you if you conquer this world."
3.271.2	Then Prīni, the son of Soma, became sinful.
3.271.3	He said: "One chooses the bad conduct of seven kinds of cattle.
3.271.4	Whatever she may say, she will desire him.
3.271.5	Then Madhucchanda Vaishvamitra said, "I choose the Brahman's mouth."
3.271.6	Then Asita Daivala said, "I will examine this vessel."
3.271.7	He said, "This one alone gives them the vow."
3.271.8	Having examined it, he saw this Sama Veda.
3.271.9	Therefore he praises.
3.271.10	O Agni, for great gifts we invoke thee.
3.271.11	For thou art the great bull, O heaven and earth, for the office of Hotar.
3.271.12	Thus it is said.
3.271.13	Heaven and earth are all these worlds.
3.271.14	From that he indeed traversed all these worlds.
3.271.15	He was present at the assembly of the gods in the morning, at that of men at noon, and at that of the manes in the evening.
3.271.16	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.271.17	He who knows this moves through all these worlds and attains heaven.
3.271.18	What Asita Daivala saw, therefore it is called Asita.
3.272.1	Then it is indeed accomplished by means of success.
3.272.2	In the middle it has the Nidhana for the sake of stability.
3.272.3	Those who perform the Pavamāna of the Arbhava rite, they indeed cross the ocean by means of this rite.
3.272.4	That it has the Nidhanas in the middle is for the sake of firmness.
3.272.5	The gods indeed desired, "May the done and the undone be accomplished for us."
3.272.6	They saw this Sama.
3.272.7	They praised with it.
3.272.8	Then their Kritam-Kritam became successful.
3.272.9	They performed a sacrifice with the desire, "May our Kritam-kritam be successful."
3.272.10	Their Kritam-kritim indeed became successful.
3.272.11	Because their Kritamkritim became successful through this Sama, therefore it is called Sadhra.
3.272.12	Sadhri Vaivarapa, desiring cattle, performed austerities.
3.272.13	He sang this (hymn).
3.272.14	He praised with it.
3.272.15	He approached this Iḍā.
3.272.16	Iḍā is cattle.
3.272.17	From that he obtained cattle.
3.272.18	This is the cattle-obtaining Sāman.
3.272.19	He who knows this obtains cattle, becomes a great cattle-owner.
3.272.20	Because Sadhri Vairūpa saw it, therefore it is called Sadhram.
3.273.1	Now the Akūpara.
3.273.2	Akūpara the son of Kaśyapa, together with the Kali demons, went to the ocean.
3.273.3	He desired to find a footing there.
3.273.4	He saw this Sama.
3.273.5	He praised it.
3.273.6	Then he found a footing in the ocean, on this very earth.
3.273.7	Then the Kali demons were at his back.
3.273.8	This is the Sama of footing.
3.273.9-14	He who knows this stands firm. The Chandomas are indeed the ocean. Kashyapa is indeed capable of crossing the ocean. That which is the Aakoopara here is for crossing the ocean. The Aakoopara is the name given to that which Kashyapa saw. Then these are the two-footed ones, as mentioned in the Brahmanas.
3.273.15	These are the verses: "Flow on, O Soma, for great power."
3.273.16	For the forty-eighth day is indeed great.
3.273.17	In them is the Brāhmaṇa of Vidharma.
3.273.18	It has four directions and four ends, for animals have four feet.
3.273.19	The Chandomas are animals, for the purpose of securing animals.
3.273.20	The Upoṣu is born, the one who has come to the water. They are called Janadvatī.
3.273.21	The form of the Jagatī is indeed Janadvatī (verses).
3.273.22	This day is Jagatī.
3.273.23	Purified with cows, the blemish.
3.273.24	The gods have approached the moon.
3.273.25	O Soma, flow for us, milk the nourishing grass.
3.273.26	Increase the praiseworthy ocean.
3.273.27	Thus they are the cows and the animals. They are for the securing of animals.
3.273.28	For animals are the Chandomas.
3.273.29	"Let our songs increase him." The forty-eighth day is indeed the increased one.
3.274.1	In them is the hearing.
3.274.2	Prajapati created the sacrifice.
3.274.3	He gave it to the gods.
3.274.4	He fled in fear of destruction.
3.274.5	The gods desired, "May he hear."
3.274.6	They saw this Sama.
3.274.7	They called him with the words, "May he be heard."
3.274.8	He heard.
3.274.9	They said to him, "Return to us."
3.274.10	"I was afraid of destruction."
3.274.11	They said, "No."
3.274.12	"Do you have faith in me?"
3.274.13	To him, the hearer, they offered faith.
3.274.14	They invited him, saying, "Come here!"
3.274.15	Then the sacrifice did not leave them.
3.274.16	Then it returned to them.
3.274.17	Now the sacrifice is like a horse that has been driven back on the ninth day.
3.274.18	What is heard here is that they invite the sacrifice with this (verse).
3.274.19	Therefore, in the first (verse) one should say 'to Śrotriya', and in the other two 'to Śrotrya'.
3.274.20	And he who desires to live, he should invoke him with this very (verse).
3.275.1	Then the Yajñāyajñiya with the said Brāhmaṇa.
3.275.2	Then the Daivānika.
3.275.3	The gods and the demons contended.
3.275.4	The gods desired, 'We shall conquer the demons with Agni alone as our army.'
3.275.5	They saw this Sama.
3.275.6	They praised with it.
3.275.7	"They made Agni the leader, saying, "May Agni be auspicious for us, offered."
3.275.8	Auspicious is our gift, auspicious is the sacrifice,
3.275.9	and auspicious are the praises.
3.275.10	Make your mind auspicious, O destroyer of Vritra, by which you may conquer in battles.
3.275.11	Thus they conquered them in battles.
3.275.12	"Let the firm one destroy the many who are eager to harm." Whatever strength and power they had, he destroyed it.
3.275.13	"He stood over them, saying, 'I have overcome you.'
3.275.14	Then they conquered the Asuras with Agni alone as their army.
3.275.15	That is why the army of the gods is called the army of the divine.
3.275.16	This is the Samaveda, which conquers the enemy.
3.275.17	He who knows this conquers his enemies.
3.276.1	Now the kindling wood.
3.276.2	The sages going to heaven left the kindling wood, the fire-wood, in the forest.
3.276.3	He desired: "May I go up to heaven and meet with the three."
3.276.4	He thought, "Let me praise the participants in the sacrifice."
3.276.5	They will praise me in such a way that I will hear them."
3.276.6	He saw this verse:
3.276.7	With it he praised them:
3.276.8	Those who kindle Agni, spread the grass in order,
3.276.9	Whose friend Indra is young,
3.276.10	The great fire of these is abundant, the praise is great, the voice is wide.
3.276.11	Whose young Indra is a friend.
3.276.12	The hero runs with the brave, surrounded by those who fight.
3.276.13	Whose young friend is Indra.
3.276.14	Thus.
3.276.15	They praised him in such a way that he listened to them.
3.276.16	He heard the sound of their whips.
3.276.17	He saw this Sama.
3.276.18	He praised with it.
3.277.1	"Listen here, may the whips be in their hands, and may they give us gifts."
3.277.2	"May the Niyamas praise the variegated (Sama).
3.277.3	"May the variegated (Sama) be praised by the Niyamas. Come, O Ho, come, O Ho, O Ho, Ho, come, come, come." Thus they invite in the heavenly world.
3.277.4	From there he went to Prati-satri.
3.277.5	Having praised with this very Sama, he ascended to the heavenly world.
3.277.6	Those who spread the sacrificial grass for Agni, the kindler,
3.277.7	For whom Indra, the youthful, is here, or the one with a staff,
3.277.8	Thus he ascended to the heaven.
3.277.9	This is the heavenly Sama.
3.277.10	He who knows this attains the heavenly world.
3.277.11	Because he saw it, it is called "of the kindling wood."
3.277.12	Now the Trikakubha Brahmana, the Sama of three Indriyas.
3.277.13	The verse is Indra's, the Sama is Indra's; the end is Indra's.
3.277.14	There are three human Indriyas: the self, offspring, and cattle.
3.277.15	He thereby takes them into himself.
3.277.16	The singers sing thee, the worshippers worship thee.
3.277.17	The Brahmans, O hundred-giver, have stretched thee out like a pole.
3.277.18	For what is a hundredfold, a thousandfold, that is the form of the Chandomas.
3.277.19	The Chandomas are cattle.
3.278.1	The Udvamshiya is the said Brahman.
3.278.2	They perform the Pratihara before the final oblation.
3.278.3	The sacrificer is held by the Prastara and Pratihara.
3.278.4	They become as if past.
3.278.5	When they offer the Pratihara before the Nidhana, it is for non-passing over.
3.278.6	It becomes the Svaram.
3.278.7	It resounds the tenth day.
3.278.8	This becomes the Svaram,
3.278.9	They attain the next day with Svaram.
3.278.10	Just as one would pass from one breath to another, or from one life to another, so does it happen.
3.279.1	They use speech in the morning.
3.279.2	If they were to rise without accomplishing it, they would rise with a fault.
3.279.3	They accomplish it.
3.279.4	Those who perform sacrifices and those who attend a session are bound in Varuna's noose every day.
3.279.5	Those who go forth from here, going to Varuna's noose, go forth from here with the Stotriya verses, carrying the seed, and they find it here with the Anurudya verses. They generate it.
3.279.6	He who knows this is born with offspring and cattle.
3.279.7	The twelve-day sacrifice is yoked with the Prayaniya day and is released with the tenth day.
3.279.8	With the very yoke with which they yoke a horse or an ass, they release it again.
3.279.9	Those nine stotriya verses which are in front, those very ones are above.
3.279.10	They release them with the Samya.
3.279.11	Therefore an animal is released as it is yoked.
3.279.12	Therefore it is possible to have prosperity and protection.
3.279.13	The verses of the Pravargya rite are cut off.
3.280.1	They ask, "Where do they go?"
3.280.2	One should say, "In the tenth day."
3.280.3	The verses are connected with the verses on both sides for the uninterrupted continuity of the vital airs.
3.280.4	They (the gods) meditate on the world of another, the Brahman meditates on the world of the Kshatra, the Kshatra meditates on the worlds of the Vis and the Vi meditates on the Brahman.
3.280.5	They (the gods) lead them to the world of another which they meditate on.
3.280.6	Whatever desire they bring to him, that desire is fulfilled for him. The first three days are of the Präsrita metre.
3.280.7	By that he is made without deficiency.
3.280.8	The second (day) is completed with the Chhandas.
3.280.9	By that the second (day) of three days is completed without excess.
3.280.10	The third (day) is concluded with the Chhandasa.
3.280.11	By that alone the third (day) of the three days is completed.
3.281.1	The first day of three days is with the Gāyatrī at the beginning.
3.281.2	Therefore this Agni shines upwards.
3.281.3	The second day of three days has the Gāyatrīs in the middle.
3.281.4	Therefore this wind blows horizontally.
3.281.5	The third day is the Gayatrottama.
3.281.6	Therefore this sun shines below.
3.281.7	The gods and the demons competed.
3.281.8	They said, "He who recites the Gayatri three times without interruption conquers these worlds and the vital airs of inhalation, exhalation, and circulation."
3.281.9	He, the Angiras, sang the Gayatri three times without a break.
3.281.10	By that he conquered these worlds and the vital airs, the prāṇa, apāna and vyāna.
3.281.11	He who, knowing this, sings the Gayatri three without a break, conquers these worlds and the prāṇa-apāna-vyāna vital airs.
3.281.12	One who knows that the ten days of the Agniṣṭoma are arranged in the manner of the Prātaḥsavana, the first three days are arranged in the Prātahsavana, the second three days are arranged by the Madhyānnasavana, the third three days are arranged with the Tṛtīyasavana, and the tenth day is arranged with the Agniṣṭomasāman.
3.281.13	One who knows this is arranged for him.
3.282.1	Then these are the Apūrājya offerings.
3.282.2	Prajapati created the creatures.
3.282.3	Having created them, he thought, "I am alone."
3.282.4	He saw these sacrificial offerings of ghee.
3.282.5	With them he gratified himself for the sake of completeness.
3.282.6	Those who come on this day are indeed like those who are gratified.
3.282.7	Now, the reason why these are the offerings of ghee is that the sacrificers thus gratify themselves with them for the sake of not being exhausted.
3.282.8	The offerings of ghee are unmeasured, for the sake of the non-overcoming of the metres, for the sake the removal of evil.
3.282.9	He who knows this is separated from evil.
3.282.10	The Indra-Agni (hymn) is the highest place, he has declared it for the non-destruction of the metres, for the fame of the sacrifice.
3.282.11	One attains heaven by the sacrifice which has been made famous.
3.282.12	They say, "Why do they combine the tenth day with all the days? Then how are their Chandomas not interrupted?"
3.282.13	One should say, "By the Stoma."
3.282.14	The seventh day is the twenty-fourth. The tenth day is the twenty fourth.
3.282.15	And because this is the same butter, therefore it is so.
3.283.1	"The high-born one has risen for you." The days of rising are the days of rising. Then for the ascent of heaven.
3.283.2	This is indeed the heaven, the tenth day.
3.283.3	He offers to Indra, to Yajya, to Varuna, to the Maruts. They become Marutvatis.
3.283.4	The form of midday is indeed Marutvat.
3.283.5	They do not go beyond the form of midday.
3.283.6	You all, O Maruts, have come to us,
3.283.7	We have sought the bright forms of men.
3.283.8	Thus they desire to be.
3.283.9	For those who desire to be, this day leads to heaven.
3.283.10	In these (days) the Gayatri (verses) are as described in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.283.11	Now the Amhi-yava (verses).
3.283.12	The Amhi-yavas belong to Prajapati.
3.283.13	This day is Prajapatya.
3.283.14	Now, whatever is done on the Prajapati day here, they make it equal to the day in form.
3.283.15	By that prosperity, they become prosperous in their own community.
3.283.16	Then the Ajika for victory.
3.283.17	The gods and the Asuras fought a battle.
3.283.18	The gods desired, "We shall win this battle."
3.283.19	They saw this Sama.
3.283.20	Therefore they praised him.
3.283.21	Then indeed they won that race.
3.283.22	Those who come to this day go as if in a race.
3.283.23	That it is called a race is because of winning.
3.283.24	He who knows this wins.
3.283.25	That is called a race, because it is the form of the Sama of Prajapati, which is prosperous.
3.283.26	Where they make it prosper with the form of a, there it prospers.
3.283.27	He prospers for whom he who knows this sings.
3.284.1	Now about Abhika.
3.284.2	The gods desired: "May our heads be touched by the waters of Abhika."
3.284.3	They saw this Sama.
3.284.4	They praised with it.
3.284.5	Then they were touched by the waters in Abhika.
3.284.6	That is the Abhika-ness of Abhika.
3.284.7	Those who know this are indeed touched by the waters of the auspicious Abhiga.
3.284.8	The sages, while performing austerities, lamented.
3.284.9	They desired, "May the waters of the Abhiga touch us auspiciously."
3.284.10	They saw this Sama Veda.
3.284.11	They praised with it.
3.284.12	Then Abhiga rained on them.
3.284.13	That is the auspiciousness of Abhiga.
3.284.14	Water is indeed peace.
3.284.15	Those who come to this day are like those who are crying and those who are burning.
3.284.16	Whatever is done here is for the sake of peace.
3.284.17	Indeed, the Abhiga is the form of the Sama of Prajapati, which is accomplished in the form of the day.
3.284.18	Where they accomplish it in the form of a day, there it is accomplished.
3.284.19	He who knows this, prospers.
3.285.1	And these are the Prāṇa Pīyūṣa, the ancient, the Ukthya, in the form of Satobṛhatī verses.
3.285.2	Anuṣṭubh created the sacrifice.
3.285.3	Anuștubh is speech.
3.285.4	Anuştubh is Prajapati.
3.285.5	He said, "Having created the sacrifice, you should make the metres your sons."
3.285.6	They found them by this (verse).
3.285.7	What is three-footed, that is the Gāyatrī.
3.285.8	The Uṣṇīka and Kakubha (verses) they found by that.
3.285.9	What has twelve syllables, those are the Jagatī (verses).
3.285.10	By that alone is the Anushtup.
3.285.11	By syllables alone he found the Brihatī.
3.285.12	What is milked, that is the Paṅkti.
3.285.13	By the abode, the Tristubh.
3.285.14	What is universal, that is all the metres.
3.285.15	They find them by means of this (verse).
3.285.16	He who knows this finds them.
3.285.17	This is the essence and brilliance of all the metres.
3.285.18	They stand at the end of the sacrifice in the unconquered metre, in the essence and brilliance, of all the metres,
3.286.1	They become the Prānavatī (verses).
3.286.2	Prajapati is Prāṇav.
3.286.3	They indeed stand firm in Prajapati.
3.286.4	And indeed the heaven is the Prāṇa world.
3.286.5	They indeed stand firm in that heaven world.
3.286.6	All these have the same last syllables.
3.286.7	That they have the same last syllable, that is the reason for the name Satobṛhatī.
3.286.8	He who knows this becomes great in every way.
3.286.9-13	He said, "When they come to this day, they become confused." Therefore they make the Brihatī verses other than that. The verse "Purifying, O Soma, I hold you" should be made Brihatī. This is the known Brihatī. When many people go, making the known face, all of them become known.
3.286.14	When he says, "O Soma, when you are purifying, you are holding," it becomes a Brihatī verse. By that, this day is made known.
3.286.15	But more forms are transgressed.
3.286.16	The other forms are indeed more.
3.287.1	They say, "One who does not desire should not praise with the Bhūta Brihatī verses."
3.287.2	One should praise with these verses, not desiring.
3.287.3	The verses of these (hymns) are like the elements, in that they have twelve syllables.
3.287.4	These (hymns), which are to be the future Brihatis, are again taken up by the Brihatis.
3.287.5	Therefore one should praise with the actual Brihatis, not with the future ones.
3.287.6	They say that one who performs a sacrifice with the intention of attaining something, desires to be better and better.
3.287.7	Therefore, both should be performed, for the attainment of both desires.
3.288.1	The Utsaṅga and Niṣedha should be in the Satobṛhatī verses, and the Yajñāyajñiya should be in the Bhavidbṛhatī.
3.288.2	Thus the sun sets in the west.
3.288.3	They say, "The Madhyandina Pavamana is not for the fourth Chandas."
3.288.4	Because it is as if the fourth Chandas is being made.
3.288.5	And because it is Bṛhatī-like, it is of the same Chandas.
3.288.6	In these (verses) there is an increase and a decrease.
3.288.7	Or, having made the animals go up by means of the upward movement, they stand up by means of downward movement.
3.288.8	In this way, having made the cattle go up by means means of the upward motion, they stand up through the downward motion.
3.289.1	Between them comes the Yajñāyajñiya hymn.
3.289.2	The Yajñāayajñiya hymn is indeed the cattle.
3.289.3	Having made these cattle go up and down, they stand up.
3.289.4	These are the two breaths of Prajapati.
3.289.5	When there is a raising and lowering, they prosper through the two breaths.
3.289.6	These are the two breaths. They are the two breaths, the two breaths. These are the two kinds of enjoyment of Papvasya.
3.289.7	This is the royal assembly, the tenth day.
3.289.8	They also drive away the sinner who speaks too much in the assembly, and they also drive him down.
3.289.9	Now, the prohibition and permission of the sacrifice are for the sake of the accomplishment and prohibition of sin.
3.289.10	Speech is the Yajñāyajñiya.
3.289.11	Therein, the prohibition and the permission are within.
3.289.12	Speech is indeed the Self.
3.289.13	The prohibition and permission are the Prāṇāpānas.
3.289.14	Now, the Yajñāyajñiya hymn has two verses, one of praise and one of censure. The two verses are the Prāṇa and Apāna.
3.289.15	Now, the Yajña-yajñiya has two verses, praise and censure. By these two, he encloses himself on both sides.
3.289.16	Therefore, speech is enclosed by Prāṇa and Āpāna.
3.290.1	The Yajñāyajñiya is indeed the brilliance, the midday is the Self.
3.290.2	When they bring the Yajñāayajñiya to the midday, they establish the brilliance in the Self.
3.290.3	In the earlier days, they go to the Yajñāyaajñiya with the foetus.
3.290.4	On the tenth day, they release it from the womb.
3.290.5	Therefore, on the tenth day, the embryo is expelled from the womb for the sake of progeny.
3.290.6	They bring it back to the midday.
3.290.7	The midday is the self, and this is the progeny.
3.290.8	In that they bring back the Yajyayajniya to the midday, they indeed establish the progeny in the self.
3.290.9-12	The gods, having ascended to the heavenly world by the Yajñāyajñiya (hymn) from midday, and the Uṣṇīṣa and Kakubha (hymns) being the last, the Brhatī (hymn) being the first, the Puruṣa (hymn) is the metre, the Kakubha is the heavenly world, the Brhat is the heavenly world; having attained to the heavenly world, they ascended to the heavenly region. The gods and the Asuras fought a battle for the sacrifice.
3.290.13	They made the Yajñāyajñiya the last (Sāman).
3.290.14	The gods desired, 'We shall win this race.'
3.290.15	They drew back the Yajñayajñiya towards midday, thinking, 'We shall conquer from here.'
3.290.16	This indeed is the field of the gods, where Pavamāna is.
3.290.17	From there they won that race.
3.291.4	Now, when they bring the Yajnyayajniya (Sutra) at midday, they establish the animals in themselves.
3.291.5	Then these (verses) come: "The sage, the knower of truth, is awake." They are the verses to be recited on the Udanvat day.
3.291.6	If they were to make them Prativatas, they would go beyond.
3.291.7	Since they are Avatas, it is for non-exceeding.
3.291.8	They say, "Those who perform the Avatīya rites on the Uthanīya day are indeed falling away."
3.291.9	Therefore it is said, "Soma has shone forth for us with light" - for the sake of not falling away by means of advance.
3.291.10	Among them, the Gaurīvita.
3.291.11	The Gaurīvita is cattle, the offspring; the midday is the self.
3.291.12	Now, when they bring back the Gaurīvit (cows) to the middle of the day, they establish the offspring and cattle in themselves.
3.291.13	The Gaurīvit is the cow, the middle of the days is the self.
3.291.14	When they bring back the cows to the middle of day, they establish in themselves the cow.
3.291.15	The Gauravit is the sap, the middle of day is the self.
3.291.16	Now, when they bring the midday meal from the Gaurīva forest, they establish the sap in themselves.
3.292.1	Then the Rathantara.
3.292.2	The Rathantara is indeed Brahman.
3.292.3	They proceed, establishing themselves in Brahman.
3.292.4	It is in the Gāyatrī verses that the Rathantara occurs. Thus they proceed, establishing the semen in the womb.
3.292.5	He who knows this, his semen, when deposited, produces offspring.
3.292.6	The Rathantara indeed is the Gayatri. The Gayatri is a meter.
3.292.7	In that the Rathantara is the background in the Gayatri verses, they thus enrich it with its own place.
3.292.8	With that prosperity, he prospers among his own people.
3.292.9	These three are joined together in the right order: the Gāyatrī metre, the twenty-four-fold Stoma, and the Rathantara Sāman.
3.292.10	That they are joined together in this order is for prosperity.
3.292.11	He who knows this prospers.
3.293.1	These indeed are the Arka and Udamani verses, which are inserted in the Rathantara's syllables.
3.293.2-5	They rise up against the two enemies. They say, "This is the extended (day) and the contracted (night)." One should say, "Both." "The extended and the contracted." "The Sama hymns are extended and the metres are contracted."
3.293.6	These are the verses. Let no one else recite them. He thus speaks of the months and half-months.
3.293.7	And they are born according to Prajapati.
3.293.8	The praise-singer sings Indra, the bull, with his companion, repeatedly reciting the hymns.
3.293.9	The unerring bull, as it were, the cow for the hosts, 
3.294.2	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
3.294.3	The gods desired, "May we be superior to the Asuras."
3.294.4	They saw this Abhivarta (ritual).
3.294.5	With it they overcame the Asuras.
3.294.6	What they overcame, that is the Abhivarta's Abhivarta-ness.
3.294.7	Now, the Abhivarta (rite) is performed here. The Abhivarta is the thunderbolt. With the thunderbolt they rise up having overcome the hated enemy.
3.294.8	It has one syllable as its concluding verse.
3.294.9	Speech has one syllable.
3.294.10	The heavenly world is as if contrary to this (rite).
3.294.11	The tenth day is indeed the heavenly world.
3.294.12	Now, that it ends with the syllable 'eka' is so that it may not be broken.
3.294.13	Now, this is the Kada-sutra.
3.294.14	Agni is the Rathantara.
3.294.15	The Visve Devas are the Kada.
3.294.16	Now, that is heaven, that is this world, and the Visve Devas.
3.294.17	They indeed stand in heaven and in this world among the Visve Devs.
3.295.1	The Gāyatra verses of Pavamāna are the most delightful and delightful of the three Savanas.
3.295.2	Juice is indeed Madhu.
3.295.3	The third Savana is like a daughter.
3.295.4	In that these (verses) are Madhu-related, they indeed place juice in it, and thus they nourish it.
3.295.5	In those (verses), the Gāyatra is as explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.295.6	Then, having established the two-footed, two-footed, and two-footed, for prosperity.
3.295.7	The sacrificer is two-footed, indeed, for prosperity. His Rk has a concluding verse.
3.295.8	They perform the concluding verse.
3.295.9	The Rk is indeed cattle, the Rathantara is cattle, for the securing of cattle.
3.295.10	Then the Uṣṇīṣa and Kakubha.
3.295.11	Indra struck Vṛtra with the thunderbolt by means of the Uṣṇiṣa and Kakuba.
3.295.12	He struck him.
3.295.13	The thunderbolt is the two Kakubhas.
3.295.14	He who knows this, indeed, strikes down with the thunderbolt his enemy, the evil one, the foe.
3.295.15	With the Kakubha he struck with the Uṣṇīsa.
3.295.16	Therefore, in the Kakubha, the middle syllables are the most numerous.
3.295.17	For, indeed, while striking, he collected the syllables.
3.295.18	Therefore, in the Uṣṇīṣa, the syllables are more numerous and superior.
3.295.19	The Vajra is indeed like a superior teacher, being smaller in size.
3.295.20	The Kakub said, "I am indeed the most inferior."
3.295.21	"While I was striving, my syllables were stolen by the one who used me first."
3.295.22	Then Uṣṇīk said, "They call me the first."
3.295.23	"So be it."
3.295.24	They made her the first.
3.295.25	She chose the first application and the first recitation.
3.295.26	Therefore they apply it to her in this way.
3.295.27	Therefore she is called Uṣṇīkkakku.
3.296.1	These are the verses: "Flow, O Indra, most sweet, the pressed Soma, the offered."
3.296.2	The third pressing is the milk of the Rgīsa, the milk of the Dhiṣṇiya, the milk of what is worn out.
3.296.3	Therefore Indra, being disgusted, went away.
3.296.4	For it was like milk.
3.296.5	The gods said to him, "Flow for us."
3.296.6	"Madhumad" means "having honey".
3.296.7	"Indra, the Soma, the most knowing of rites, is the Madhu."
3.296.8	"The most powerful of the days is the Madhu"
3.296.9	Thus he makes it to be like Madhu, in the forward order.
3.296.10	"These pressed juices are for Indra" means "as one would lead forward the one who is coming forward".
3.296.11	The Pavamanyas are true and belong to Indra. They are full of power.
3.296.12	Therefore, these are the only ones to be performed.
3.296.13	In them, the Sāman is Uktā Brāhmaṇam.
3.296.14	Now, the Pauṣkala Sāman is called Uktā Brāhmam.
3.296.15	Now, these are the verses: "Parīṣu pra dhanvā vājasātāya" - these are Anushtubh verses with Pipilika in between, having the form of Antasya.
3.296.16	Anushtubh is the form of Anta among the metres.
3.296.17	This day is Anushtubh.
3.297.1	Indra, having struck Vritra with the thunderbolt, went to the farthest end, thinking, "There is no thirst."
3.297.2	That is the Anushtubh indeed the farthest.
3.297.3	He entered that very one.
3.297.4	For it, he brought twelve syllables from the east and twelve from above.
3.297.5	Then the eight-syllabled Gāyatrī in the middle, he entered that.
3.297.6	He entered just that one.
3.297.7-13	Those are the twelve syllables of that (goddess). Brahma is the Gāyatrī. Brahma itself entered in the middle of that (goddess) He placed this year on both sides. These are the verses of Indragraha. They rise up, indeed, resorting to Indragraha. Therefore, one who is attacked or has an enemy should perform this.
3.297.14	These verses are indeed Indra's Grahas.
3.297.15	By resorting to this very Indra's Graha, he overcomes his hateful enemy.
3.298.1	He who, knowing this, praises with these verses, indeed takes up the consecration in safety, performs the sacrifice in safety, and rises in safety.
3.298.2	They make this Paroksa Anushtubh.
3.298.3	If they were to perform the Anushtubh verse directly, the sacrificers would go to the farthest end and would not stand firm.
3.298.4	But when they perform the Anushtubh verse indirectly, it is for stability.
3.298.5	In this connection, there is the Brāhmaṇa on Śyāvāśva.
3.298.6	It ends with the statement "This is the end of speech."
3.298.7	They say, "Those who take up the Yajñāyajñiya at midday from the third pressing go to the end."
3.298.8	But because it ends with the Vaṅga-sāman, they do not go beyond the form of the Yajñāyañjya, and because of that they do not go past the third pressing.
3.298.9	Therefore this is the Sāman, and this is the day, which is not interrupted.
3.298.10	The rays of the sun are drawn out, thus they are connected with the sun, for the sake of driving away the Rakshas.
3.298.11	The envious ones sleep together.
3.298.12	The streams flow around the stretched thread, nothing flows from Indra.
3.298.13	Thus nothing flows from Indra.
3.298.14-15	The mind is called up, it is sprinkled with honey. This world is called up. By this they follow this world. They establish the animals in this world.
3.299.4	The gods and the Asuras contended for food.
3.299.5	The gods desired, "We shall win the food of the Asuras."
3.299.6	They saw this Sama.
3.299.7	They praised with it.
3.299.8	They won the wealth of the Vājas, all the wealth of the Asuras, whatever wealth there was, whatever cattle there was, whatever food there was.
3.299.9	That very thing is the winning of the prize.
3.299.10	This is the prosperity of food.
3.299.11	He who knows this obtains food, obtains, takes away the wealth of his enemies, the cattle, the food of him who knows this.
3.299.12	It consists of ten kinds of wealth.
3.299.13	The first day is accomplished with one kind of wealth, the tenth with ten kinds of wealth.
3.299.14	Now, the ten-day sacrifice is concluded with a sacrifice having ten verses. By that very (sacrifice) the ten days are completed.
3.299.15	And they conclude with this ten-versed Viraj, having secured food.
3.300.1	By the twelve-day sacrifice, the gods went upward to the heavenly world.
3.300.2	The Asuras, the Rakshas followed them. They made the metres their rear-guard.
3.300.3	Those (verses) which are cut off, they are yoked in the imperishable (verses).
3.300.4	Then these (verses) are not cut off.
3.300.5	Therefore the Stoma of the odd (verses) is more powerful.
3.300.6	One should perform this Tristubh (verse) of them, one would not be defeated.
3.300.7	This is the defeated metre.
3.300.8	One stands at the end of the sacrifice in the defeated metre alone.
3.300.9	They are thirty-three syllables.
3.300.10	Thirty-three are all the deities.
3.300.11	In all the deities the sacrifice is established at the end.
3.300.12	They become hairy Virajas, for Viraj is food, for the securing of food.
3.300.13	They are Agni-related.
3.300.14	The Udgātṛ makes the mouth and the sacrificer the principal.
3.300.15	He who knows this becomes the principal, the best eater of food, the best among his kinsmen.
3.301.1	Among them, the Vāmadevya.
3.301.2	The Vāmadevyā is indeed the peace between the Sūkta and the Sastra.
3.301.3	Whatever is done wrongly in the sacrifice, they make amends for it by this (hymn) and then rise up.
3.301.4	The Vamadevya hymn is indeed the essence of the sacrifice.
3.301.5	Just as one would make amends for a big lump of clay by means of a small lump, in the same way they make amends for all the hymns and praises by means of the Vamadevya.
3.301.6	Prajapati indeed is the Vamadevya among the hymns.
3.301.7	Just as all the knowledge of creation is established in Prajapati, so all the hymns are established in Vamadevya.
3.301.8	Vamadevya is the womb.
3.301.9	They release it from the womb on the tenth day.
3.301.10	Therefore, the embryo is expelled from the womb on the tenth day for the sake of progeny.
3.301.11	The Vamadevya is the vital airs.
3.301.12	They say, "Those who perform the sacrificial rites beyond the prescribed limit, or do not perform them, are indeed deprived of the vital airs."
3.301.13	For who knows whether they perform it beyond the prescribed limit or not?
3.301.14	Now, whatever is the Vamadevya (hymn), it is indeed the breath itself. By that he prospers.
3.301.15	Indeed, the Vamadevys are the best of hymns, Agni is the best of deities, the Viraj is the best of metres, the Trayastrimsa is the best of Stomas.
3.301.16	They rise up having placed themselves in the truth.
3.301.17	They become true.
3.301.18	Now, indeed, he who knows this four-footed altar of the twelve-day sacrifice, which is not to be surpassed, mounts it at the end. The Sama is Vamadevya, the deity Agni, the metre Viraj, the Stoma Trayastrimsa.
3.301.19	He who knows this mounts it.
3.302.1	Gaurivatir saw this Stoma of thirty-three for the Shaktya, for the securing of both kinds of cattle, those belonging to the village and those belonging to the forest.
3.302.2	Then he secured both kinds of cattle.
3.302.3	Now, because they do not go beyond the thirty-three-fold Stoma, therefore the thirty-threefold Stoma is performed at the end, for the purpose of securing all the animals.
3.302.4	For this man indeed stands beyond, having been injured.
3.302.5	There are ten fingers of a man. For the purpose of securing the fingers.
3.302.6	For this person indeed stands beyond, being injured.
3.302.7-11	The ten fingers of a man, the ten steps, the ten breaths, the two supports, the self, and the thirty-three are the twelve days. The animals in the forest are the others. Therefore, they approach the animal that is running away. Because this is done to the one who is running away. The twelve days are the sons of Prajapati, the single hero.
3.302.12	They say that this is the twenty-fourth day.
3.302.13	All of it should be done as twenty-four, for these sons of Prajapati, the Ekavīras, are not reversed.
3.302.14	In that they consist of thirty-three syllables, they do not fall short of the thirty-three Stoma.
3.302.15	But other forms may be exceeded.
3.302.16	The other forms are more numerous.
3.302.17	The Triṇcat is indeed the only one to be performed.
3.302.18	The Tri-ṇcat is indeed all the deities.
3.302.19	In all these deities, the sacrifice is indeed established at the end.
3.302.20	And this indeed is the firm and established Stoma of all deities, where there is the Triṇcat.
3.302.21	Therefore, the Stoma should be performed at the end.
3.303.1	They indeed tempt one to wealth.
3.303.2	One should add the nine Stotriyas of the Brahma-saman.
3.303.3	Those who are not yoked and those who are yoked, they do not attain wealth in both the Stomas. They stand firm.
3.303.4	Just as one standing in the middle would release (the arrow), so at the end all the hymns and praises are released with Vamadevya.
3.303.5	They say, "Should one release or not?"
3.303.6	They say, one should not release.
3.303.7	Those who come to this day are indeed going to a race.
3.303.8	Among them, he who is struck down is the loser.
3.303.9	Whatever he puts down as inferior, that it becomes.
3.303.10	Whoever puts down something as inferior, both of them are inferior.
3.303.11	And indeed they celebrate Prajapati with this day.
3.303.12	For who is worthy to advise on the celebration of what is better?
3.303.13-18	He who gives advice for the welfare (of the sacrificer) and by which he desires him to be in distress, he leads him to that. They say, "Brahman alone should advise." Brahman is Brahman. Brahman alone should explain that sacrifice. They also say, "The Udgātṛ alone should advise." The Udgātṛ is Prajāpati.
3.303.19-24	Prajapati himself made that sacrifice. Some say: The sacrificer himself should announce. The sacrificer is indeed the sacrifice. He himself made that sacrifice.
3.303.25	That is the same as being both explicit and implicit.
3.303.26	They say that it is only explicit.
3.303.27	If one were to remain silent when it is not explicit, then they would be cut off from the sacrifice. Therefore, it is only explicit, so that there is no harm to the sacrificial.
3.303.28	Whatever he has spoken, he tells the Hotṛ.
3.303.29	The Hotṛ recites the Anushtubh verse, "This tenth day has been completed."
3.303.30	They recite together. Whatever verses are recited here, whatever is recited in excess,
3.303.31	that they complete in Prajapati. The Praśāsti is the final verse.
3.304.1	The Stoma is like a pair of animals, like smooth and even (verses).
3.304.2-6	Now, when they perform the Trivṛt Stoma, it is for the sake of procreation. From the unequalled and excessive union are born offspring and cattle. He who knows this is born with offspring and cattle. This earth was in the sky as a world. It desired, "May I attain the tawny colour."
3.304.7	She saw this mantra: "The spotted cow has come forth."
3.304.8	From that, this earth became spotted.
3.304.9	He who knows thus prospers with offspring and cattle.
3.304.10	They say: "Those who sacrifice ascend to heaven."
3.304.11	They are masters, going beyond the path.
3.304.12	Now, when they praise the Serpent-Queen, this is the Serpent-Queen; they indeed stand firm in this.
3.304.13	This is the Serpent-King.
3.304.14	He who knows this is not harmed by the creeping one.
3.305.1	They praise the Gāyatrī verses; the Gāyatrīs are the most enduring of the metres; for the sake of endurance.
3.305.2	They praise the three (goddesses) in the three (verses). These are the three worlds. For the attainment of these worlds.
3.305.3	Now, indeed, these are the three (verses) - the out-breath, the in-breath and the through-breath.
3.305.4	They attain the goal, having established themselves in them.
3.305.5	The Gāyatrī metre is the Gāyatrī. The Gāyatrī is inexhaustible. For the attainment (of the goal) of the inexhaustible.
3.305.6	Now, the mind is the Gāyatri.
3.305.7	They accomplish it with the mind, they turn back with the mind, for with the mind they praise, with the mind they recite, with the mind he takes up the beginning, with the mind one sings, with the mind it is repelled, with the mind there is a disturbance, with the mind the conclusion is attained, for the completion of what is incomplete.
3.305.8	Whatever the gods did not accomplish with speech of the sacrifice, they accomplished with the mind.
3.305.9	That which they praise with the mind, for the completion of the incomplete.
3.305.10	This is the juice of this day that has been lost.
3.305.11	He has grasped it with the mind.
3.305.12	This indeed is the juice.
3.305.13	That which they praise with mind, for the non-loss of juice.
3.306.1	These verses are the receptacle of the great vow.
3.306.2	He who is bound by the great vow, he is bound by these verses.
3.306.3	The day of mind was different, the day of speech was different.
3.306.4	What was the day of mind, the gods took it and ascended to the heavenly world.
3.306.5	What was speech's day, that became this day.
3.306.6	By that he established himself in this world with offspring and cattle.
3.306.7	What they praise with the mind, that is the reason for the praise of the day.
3.306.8	The Hotṛ explains the four Hotr priests. The four Hotr priests are indeed Brahman.
3.306.9	Brahman is indeed worthy of receiving his praises and prayers.
3.306.10	These are the secret names of the gods, namely the four Hotars.
3.306.11	He makes them known.
3.306.12	They make him known.
3.306.13	He who knows this goes to the light.
3.306.14	If a brahmin is worthy of fame but does not attain it, he should go to the forest, untie the knots and explain the four Hotr priests to them, making the brahmin the observer.
3.306.15	These are indeed the secret names of the gods, namely the four Hotr-priests.
3.306.16	He thus makes them known.
3.307.4	They say that the Stotra should be recited at the Samishta offerings, not at the Patnisamyaja offerings.
3.307.5	They say that it should be recited at Samishta offerings.
3.307.6	They indeed place the foetus in the west.
3.307.7	It is indeed a woman's strength and also a sin.
3.307.8	The Stotra should be performed at the Samishța offerings for the exclusion of sin.
3.307.9	Then indeed, a woman does not have that strength.
3.307.10	Then indeed, they conceive the foetus in the opposite direction.
3.307.11	Men are born both facing and facing away.
3.307.12	Therefore, one should praise in the opposite direction."
3.307.13	They begin with the Udumbara (wood). Udumbara is food, food is energy; for the attainment of food and energy.
3.307.14	They restrain speech.
3.307.15	Speech is indeed Brahman.
3.307.16	They restrain speech, indeed Brahman, in their selves.
3.307.17	Here is firmness, here is self-firmness, here is the immortal, here is the imperishable.
3.307.18	Whatever is the mind, whatever is firmness, whatever is the intellect, whatever is speech, they restrain all that in their selves.
3.307.19	If they were to release it when the sun has set, they would destroy the world of the enemy.
3.307.20	If they were to release when the sun has not yet set, they would be destroying the world of the foe.
3.307.21	They release it after going to the Ahavaniya fire when the sun is half-set.
3.307.22	Thus they destroy the enemy with both day and night.
3.307.23	He who knows this, indeed, conquers his enemy by both the day and the night.
3.307.24	They say that one should let go after sunset.
3.307.25	When the day and night are revolving, one attains the year.
3.307.26	The year is the sacrifices.
3.307.27	Having obtained the sacrifice, they let it go, uniting with the mother, the mother uniting with the son, the son uniting with the mother. May the nourishment of wealth, food and strength be bestowed upon us. Svāhā!
3.307.28	Just as one would unite a cow with a bull and then let it go, in the same way they unite the voice and the sacrificer and then let it loose.
3.307.29	As he says, so he does not transgress them.
3.307.30	They should meditate on whatever desire they may desire.
3.307.31	That very desire is accomplished for them.
3.307.32	They release speech with Subrahmaṇya.
3.307.33	Brahma is Subrahmaṇyā.
3.307.34	Brahma indeed is speech.
3.307.35	They release that speech with Brahma.
3.308.1	Agni himself is the first day, Indra the second, Prajapati the third, Brihaspati the fourth, the Maruts the fifth, the Vishvedevas the sixth, the Vasus the seventh, the Rudras the eighth, the Adityas the ninth, and Prajapati himself the tenth day.
3.308.2	This very direction is the going forth, this is the rising.
3.308.3	Therefore, this sun sets from here and rises from there.
3.308.4	This is the same as the setting and rising.
3.308.5	The Trivrit is the swift, the Pañcadaśa is the shining, the Vyom is the seventeenfold, the Dhruva is the twenty-one, the Ojas is the twenty-nine, the Pratiṣṭhā is the thirty-three, the Brahman is the twenty-four, the Ksatra is the forty-four, the Vivarta is the forty-eight, the Stoma of the Visas is the fifty-six, Prajapati is the tenth day.
3.309.1	Now, as to why it is called Trivrit, just as a bird flies quickly, so this is Trivrit Stoma.
3.309.2	Then the Dyabhanta is fifteen, for that is the nobility.
3.309.3	Nobility shines forth.
3.309.4	Then the Vyom is seventeen, for that is Prajapati.
3.309.5	Prajapati is indeed the Vyom.
3.309.6	Now, why is it called the One-and-Twenty? Because that is the sun.
3.309.7	For everything here is held in this.
3.309.8	Now, why is it the Twenty-Nine? Because that is Maruts.
3.309.9	For Maruts are strength and vigour.
3.309.10	Strength and vigour are the Twenty-Nine.
3.309.11	Now, what is the Thirty-Three? Because that is its end.
3.309.12-18	Now, as to why it is twenty-four, it is indeed the Gāyatrī. Brahma is indeed the Gãyatrī. Now, as to why (it is) forty-four, it (is) indeed the Tristubh. The Kshatra is indeed the Tristubha. Now, why (it is forty-eight) is the Stoma of the Visas, it is indeed a Jagatī. The Visas are indeed the Jagatī. The Anushtubh is indeed all this.
3.309.19	This is the going forth, this is the rising up.
3.309.20	Therefore they go forth from here and rise up from there.
3.309.21	Fire is the going forth; the sun is the rising up;
3.309.22	He who knows this goes to this world knowing the end.
3.310.1	The first three days are with the Gayatri as the face.
3.310.2	Therefore this fire shines upward in this world.
3.310.3	The second day is in the middle of the Gayatri.
3.310.4	From that, the wind blows horizontally in this atmosphere.
3.310.5	The third day is at the end of the Gayatri
3.310.6	From that, that sun shines below the heaven.
3.310.7	These are the arrows of the gods, sharp, unerring, and standing in these worlds, repelling all evil. They stand, Agni on earth, Vayu in the sky, Aditya in heaven.
3.310.8	They go, destroying all his evil, he who knows this.
3.310.9	By these victorious, by these conquering, these worlds have been conquered and separated, each according to its own way.
3.310.10	Because, though being in the same sacrificial rite, they become different, therefore the gods, the fathers, and men, though being in one world, saw each other.
3.310.11	By these victorious, by these victorious, by the victorious, by the victors, as befits each one.
3.311.1	Prajapati, generating the creatures, was afflicted with sin from the mouth.
3.311.2	He desired, 'May I destroy sin.'
3.311.3	He saw this first three-day (rite) with the Gayatri (verse) as the opening (verse).
3.311.4	With that he drove away sin from the mouth,
3.311.5	and it afflicted him from the middle.
3.311.6-12	He saw this second three-day sacrifice, the Gayatra in the middle. With that he struck away sin from the middle. He cut it off from the foot. He saw this third three-day sacrifice which is the Gayatra at the end. With that, he struck away sin at the end. He cut it off from his foot. He sees this third three-days sacrifice which is the Gāyatra at the end.
3.311.13	By that he struck off evil.
3.311.14	He who knows thus strikes off evil.
3.311.15	By the Svaranta (chant) Prajapati protected himself from death, by the Nidhananta (chant) he protected his offspring, and by the Idanta (chant) his cattle.
3.311.16	This is all that exists, namely, the self, offspring and cattle.
3.311.17	That he protected himself by the Svaranta (mantra) is the reason why the Sattra is called a Sattra.
3.311.18	He who knows this is saved from all sin.
3.311.19	Prajapati created the gods with the Svaranta (tone), the ancestors with the Nidhananta (tone), and the men with the Ida (tone).
3.311.20	Because he created the gods with Svaranta, they became immortal.
3.311.21	For he created them with the immortal breath.
3.311.22	Now, because he created the Pitrs with the Nidhana, therefore they are established in the Nidhana.
3.311.23	And because he created men with the Ida, and Ida is cattle, therefore those who have cattle are approached by men.
3.312.1	Now, indeed, Kabandha Atharvaṇa dwelt with Kesin Darbha.
3.312.2	Then indeed, at that time, the metres were mixed up and not separated.
3.312.3	To him, Kaṇḍa, the son of Atharva, taught this Vyuḍha-metre sacrifice of twelve days to Keśin, the son of Dārbhāyai, saying, "Satisfy the Gāyatrī three times, the Tristubh three times, and the Jagatī three times.
3.312.4	Your own subjects are the only ones who desire life, not your subjects.
3.312.5	Therefore, he is praised.
3.312.6	Then indeed, the later Vedic verses were composed.
3.312.7	Therefore, even though the Panchalas are poor, others desire life for them alone.
3.312.8	These two verses are about him:
3.312.9	Why do the creations go upwards from the earth? Why do they go sideways in the sky?
3.312.10	Why do they go downwards from the heaven, following the rays of the sun?
3.312.11	Gāyatrī, clothed in the Trivṛt, pushed the Tristubh from the sky,
3.312.12	She, from the abode of heaven, the Jagati, from that, the worlds flow down.
3.313.1	Speech, creating the sacrifice, became hungry and thirsty.
3.313.2	The gods, desiring to satisfy her with the sacrifice offered to her,
3.313.3	did not satisfy her.
3.313.4	They, desiring to satisfy it with the Soma-oblation and sacrificial offerings,
3.313.5	did not succeed in satisfying it.
3.313.6	They saw this sacrifice of twelve days, with the Vyuha-chant.
3.313.7	They brought it.
3.313.8	They performed it.
3.313.9	Then they obtained the Chanda-s for that sacrifice.
3.313.10	They were satisfied with the Dhenu-parisaara for the share of another.
3.313.11	Therefore animals are satisfied with the Dhehu-parisaara, for the share of one another.
3.313.12	They were not satisfied.
3.313.13	He who knows this satisfaction of speech and the metres, is satisfied by himself, and his progeny is satisfied.
3.313.14	The gods, having yoked the divine horses to the divine chariots, ascended these worlds.
3.313.15	The metres indeed are the divine horses, the stomas are the divine chariots.
3.314.1	They made the Gāyatrī the right-hand yoke, the Tristubh the left-hand yoke, and the Jagatī the left-hand pressing.
3.314.2	By that they ascended this world.
3.314.3	They said, "The path is longer, it goes to the opposite direction.
3.314.4	They made the Jagati the southern yoke, the Gayatri the left yoke, the Tristubh the left yoke, and the Prsti the left yoke.
3.314.5	By that they ascended this world of the atmosphere.
3.314.6	They said, "The path of the gods is superior. Let us go around it."
3.314.7	They made the Tristubh the right-hand yoke, the Jagati the left-hand yoke, and the Gayatri the left-hand pressing.
3.314.8	By that they ascended this world.
3.314.9	Thus indeed, the gods, having yoked the divine horses in the divine chariots, ascended these worlds.
3.314.10	He who knows thus, ascends these worlds.
3.315.1	The Gāyatrī metre is the first step, the Tristubh the second, the Jagatī the third, the Anuştubh the fourth, the Atichandas the fifth, and the Bṛhatī the sixth.
3.315.2	The Gāyatrī is the first step.
3.315.3	The Gâyatrî has three feet.
3.315.4	These worlds are three.
3.315.5	The Tristubh is the second step. The Tristubh has eleven syllables, and its feet are eleven.
3.315.6-12	The Jagati has twelve syllables, and its feet are of various lengths. The Anushtubh has no feet. For the Anushtubh is without feet, and it has the same number of syllables as the Gāyatrī. The Gāyatrī has eight syllables, and the Anushtubb has eight syllables. The Pankti has five feet, for it has five feet. The Atichhandas has no feet, for there are not so many syllables in any metre.
3.316.1	Prajapati, when he created the Brihat and the Rathantara, saw first of all the mind in the Brihat, and the speech in the Rathantara.
3.316.2	When he uttered the Rathantara over speech, therefore the Rathantara came first to be yoked.
3.316.3	And because he saw the mind first in the Brihat therefore they are called the Brihat and Rathantara.
3.316.4	Mind is the former, and speech is the latter.
3.316.5	Mind is the Brihat, and speech is Rathantara.
3.316.6	Brahman is the Rathantara, and Kshatra is the Brihat.
3.316.7	This mind has surpassed speech, and this Kshatra has surpassed Brahman.
3.316.8	This Rathantara knows, "It has indeed surpassed me."
3.316.9	He created that Vairapa.
3.316.10	With that he went around in front.
3.316.11-17	They became two and went away. It is this Brihat that knows, 'It does not think of me.' It created the Vairāja. It went around in front with it. They became two and went off. It is this Rathantara that knows, 'it does not think of me.' It created Shakra. It went round in front with it.
3.316.18	Those three became the Bṛhat and Ati-Bṛhat.
3.316.19	"It knows this great (Sāman) and thinks, 'It is indeed greater than me."
3.316.20	He created the Raivata.
3.316.21	It went around in front.
3.316.22	Those three became the Āryā and Ati-Āryā.
3.316.23	They reached the end.
3.316.24	They knew that it was the same and that there was nothing else beyond it.
3.316.25	Those six verses were the three metres.
3.316.26	Those three metres did not follow those six verses.
3.317.1	She created the Gāyatrī metre from the Anushtubh metre.
3.317.2	She took up the fourth day.
3.317.3	With that, the fourth day was created.
3.317.4	The Tristubh metre created the Paṅkti metre.
3.317.5	She accepted the fifth day.
3.317.6	With that he made the fifth day.
3.317.7	He created the Jagati in the Atichandas metre.
3.317.8	It took the sixth day.
3.317.9	With that he made the sixth day. 
3.317.10	Those were the six back-supports, the six shoulders.
3.317.11	They made a pair.
3.317.12	For him whose cattle and offspring make a pair, for him who knows this.
3.317.13	The first day is extended by the Gāyatrī, the second by the Tristubh, the third by the Jagatī, the fourth by the Anushtubh, the fifth by the Paṅkti, and the sixth by the Atichandas.
3.317.14	Therefore, on the sixth day, the Atichandas is praised.
3.317.15	Just as one who wants to cross a deep river would want to cross the shallowest part, so did the gods want to cross the sixth day with the Atichandas verses.
3.317.16	And they wanted to do so at that time. And also for the continuity of the subsequent three days of the sixth day, for the uninterrupted continuity.
3.318.1	Water was here before, a great expanse of water.
3.318.2	In that (sacrifice) Prajapati desired to establish himself.
3.318.3	He saw this Vaishvanara Pratiraatra (sacrifice) as the one to be performed at the beginning (of the season).
3.318.4	He laid it down.
3.318.5	In this world, above this water, he spread it out.
3.318.6	What he spread out, that is the earth.
3.318.7	On that he established himself.
3.318.8	That was indeed like darkness.
3.318.9	Night is the successor of day.
3.318.10	He saw this Agniṣṭoma consisting of three Stotras.
3.318.11	He placed it on this Agni on this earth.
3.318.12	By means of that light he saw these worlds.
3.318.13	He spread out the eight Utkhya (hymns) and the eight Atayasa (hymns), the animals, the directions, the Vamadevya (hymn), the atmosphere, the Aditya (hymn) and the tenth day, this very world, the northern Atiratra.
3.318.14	He spread out this all-pervading (hymn).
3.318.15	This whole (world) came into existence.
3.318.16	He who knows this all-pervasive (hymn) becomes all-pervasive and this whole (world) comes into existence.
3.318.17-19	The six-day Pañcadaśa sacrifice is the seasons, the two Atirātras are the directions, the two Aṣṭaka sacrifices are the two worlds. The six-day Paṣadaśa sacrifice is indeed the seasons, the half-months, the months, the day and night, the two Atrātras are the two worlds, the two Aștākas are the two worlds.
3.318.20	Now, because the lesser Agni shines in the morning, therefore this Agni, being lesser, shines in the morning.
3.318.21	And because the greater Aditya shines in the evening, therefore this Aditya, being greater, shines in the evening.
3.318.22	He who knows that the twelve-day sacrifice is the Self, all his desires are fulfilled.
3.319.1	The Atiratra is the image of the feet.
3.319.2	There are nine vital airs in man.
3.319.3	It is three-fold.
3.319.4	The Pravargya rite is three-fold
3.319.5	By that it is accomplished.
3.319.6	There are ten fingers and four arms on the chest.
3.319.7	What is above the navel is fifteen.
3.319.8	The second day is fifteen.
3.319.9	By that it is accomplished.
3.319.10	Ten fingers are the hands, seven are the head, and the vital airs.
3.319.11	That is seventeen.
3.319.12	The third day is seventeen. By that it is accomplished
3.319.13	Ten fingers are hands, ten are feet, and the self is twenty-one.
3.319.14	The fourth day is twenty-one.
3.319.15	That is accomplished by that.
3.319.16	Ten fingers, ten steps, seven heads, and seven vital airs.
3.319.17	That is twenty-seven.
3.319.18	The fifth day is twenty-seven (verses).
3.319.19	That is accomplished by that (verse).
3.319.20	Ten fingers,十步十命, mind, speech, and heart, that is thirty-three.
3.319.21	The sixth day is thirty-three.
3.319.22	That is why it is accomplished.
3.319.23	The breath itself is the seventh day, the Gāyatrī.
3.319.24	The eye itself is the eighth day, the Tristubh.
3.319.25	The ear itself is the ninth day, the Jagatī.
3.319.26	Speech itself is the tenth day, the Anushtubh.
3.319.27	And what is above the ears is the later Atiratra.
3.319.28	The breath is the earlier Atiratra, the exhalation is the later.
3.319.29	They call the Prāyaniya and Udayaniya (sacrifices) indirectly.
3.319.30	He stands between the Prāṇa and Apāna, he does not suffer from the Prāṇa-Apāna, he comes to the whole life. Thus indeed, the whole twelve-day (sacrifice) attains itself, and all desires attain him who knows thus.
3.320.1	The twelve-day sacrifice is indeed the equinox.
3.320.2	He who knows the equinox of this sacrifice, becomes the lord of prosperity. The equinox is the lord of prosperity, the lord of the best.
3.320.3	The man is the equinox of this sacrificial session.
3.320.4	For the man is the equinox among these worlds.
3.320.5	These worlds are the twelve-day sacrifice. One should think, "I am the equinox of this session." One should perform this twelve-day sacrifice.
3.320.6	Now, at this very sacrifice, he attains the solstice.
3.320.7	He is indeed established in this very self.
3.320.8	The first day, the second day, the third day, thus each day shines.
3.320.9	The sun is indeed the day.
3.320.10	They attain him by this, they go to his world.
3.321.1	Prajapati indeed was the first to know this.
3.321.2	He desired, "May I be many, may I beget, may I attain the earth."
3.321.3	He indeed became eighteen syllables.
3.321.4	He divided them into two groups of nine.
3.321.5	He became the Trivrt stoma and the Gayatri metre.
3.321.6	This Trivrit Stoma was complete, and the Gayatri was the ninth Prastara.
3.321.7	The Prastara was the ninth of it.
3.321.8	This Trivrit Stotra said to her, "Come, let us be born together."
3.321.9	Being equal, they were unable to be born together.
3.321.10	She said, "Now we are not able to be born together, being equal."
3.321.11	The ninth syllable is the one that you should understand."
3.321.12	What will it be?"
3.321.13	"Whatever exists, that will be."
3.321.14	"So it is."
3.321.15	They understood it.
3.321.16	It became the Pranava itself.
3.322.1	That is the Pratihara, the Udgitha, and the Ashravanam.
3.322.2	Therefore, having uttered "Om," he recites "Om," he sings "Om," he announces "Om."
3.322.3	This is indeed what exists, what was.
3.322.4	She said, "Now indeed, therefore, enough of your own, go to procreation, go to procreate."
3.322.5	She said, "You generate the metres; I shall generate the Stotras."
3.322.6	He generated the Trivrit Stoma and the Catuvirsati Stotriya.
3.322.7	Then the Gāyatrī generated twenty-four syllables.
3.322.8	She said, "You grow as much as you are."
3.322.9	The eight syllables became the three syllables.
3.322.10	And those became twenty-four.
3.322.11	Twenty-four were the earlier ones.
3.322.12	This was her forty-eight progeny.
3.322.13	This Gāyatrī took four syllables.
3.322.14	It became with a nasal sound.
3.322.15	The other took six.
3.323.1-11	It became the fifteen-fold Stoma. He took the four-fold (Stoma). It became the Anushtubh (Stoma). The other (Stoma) became the six-fold. He took (the Stoma) which became the twenty-one-fold. The four-fold (Stomas) were taken. It became the Brihatī (Stoma). Other (Stomas) became the sixfold. He (took) the twenty-seven-fold Stoma, The four-folds were taken. They became the Brihatīs.
3.323.12	The other six he took up.
3.323.13	It became a Stoma of thirty-nine.
3.323.14	He took up four.
3.323.15	It became the Paṅkti metre.
3.323.16	The other six he took.
3.323.17	It became Stoma of thirtythree.
3.323.18	It reached the end.
3.323.19	He took four.
3.323.20	It becomes the Tristubh metre.
3.323.21	He took the other four.
3.323.22	It become the Jagati metre.
3.323.23	They went to the end of it, and she said, "We shall not beget any more children from here on." "Come, let us be as many syllables as we were before."
3.323.24	She became eight syllables.
3.323.25	Therefore a husband may lead his wife as he pleases.
3.324.1	They arranged themselves in the fifteen and twenty-one, and in the middle they became one.
3.324.2	He alone is Prajapati, the seventeenfold Stoma, the eater of food.
3.324.3	For him the Trivrit, Pancadasa, Ekavimsa, Trinava, Trayastrimsa Stomas are offered as oblations.
3.324.4	He said to her, "You generate the Chhandas, I shall generate the Stomas."
3.324.5	This is the three-fold Stoma. He created these Stomas, viz. the four-fold, the fourteen-fold, the sixteen-fold, the eighteen-fold, the nineteen-fold, the twenty-five-fold and the thirty-six-fold.
3.324.6	Then the Gāyatrī, the one-footed, the two-footed, the line of syllables, the line of stars, the Viraj, the Atichanda, the infinite Chanda, these are the Chanda of the deer.
3.324.7	This is the Prajapati of the Stotras and the Chandas.
3.324.8	Śaunaka Kapeya, the son of Ekatanī, asked him, "The Stomas are generated by six and four, the Chandas by five and three. But what is this Stoma which is not generated by six and is seventeen? It is as if it is obstructed in the middle."
3.324.9	He said, "The Stoma and the Chanda are not born. That is indeed Prajapati. Having gone in the middle and generating, he stood at seventeen."
3.324.10	He who knows this eye, he indeed becomes the eye everywhere.
3.324.11	This Prajapati is indeed without an eye.
3.324.12	For everything here is Prajapati's."
3.324.13	These are indeed like the eye, the Chaikitanaeyas.
3.324.14	These are the metres, they were arranged with Stomas.
3.325.1	The Trivrit Stoma was arranged with the Gayatri metre, the Pañcadaśa with the Tristubh, the Saptadaśa with the Jagati, the Ekavimsa with the Anustubh, the Trinava with the Pankti, the Trayastrimsa with the Viraj, the Pañcavimsa with the Brihatī, the Aṣṭādaśa and Nava-dasa with the Uṣṇīsa and Kakubha.
3.325.2	Those which are nine Gāyatrī verses, they are twenty-four and three.
3.325.3	Then those which are fifteen Tristubh verses, they are forty-four and fifteen.
3.325.4	Then those are seventeen Jagatī verses, they are eighty-four and seventeen.
3.325.5	Then those twenty-one Anushtubh verses, they twenty-three and thirty.
3.325.6	Then there are twenty-seven rows, forty, and twenty-nine.
3.325.7	Then there are thirty-three Virajas, thirty, and thirty-three.
3.325.8	Then there is twenty-five Brihatis, thirty-six, and twenty-five.
3.325.9	Now those who are eighteen, nineteen, and twenty-eight, they are eighteen, nineteen.
3.326.1	One indeed was this syllable in the beginning, namely, speech.
3.326.2	It desired, "May I be many, may I beget offspring, may I reach the earth, may I perform the sacrifice."
3.326.3	It offered twelve times with "Svāhā, svāhā, svāhākṛt."
3.326.4	She became thirty-three.
3.326.5	He became thirty-three syllables.
3.326.6	After that, the two syllables crept up to him.
3.326.7	She became this Anushtubh.
3.326.8	Therefore, the two breasts of a woman creep up after that.
3.326.9	This is the Virāṭ, the one with breasts.
3.326.10	When she offered twelve times, she created these twelve months.
3.326.11	Those very ones became the twelve days of the twelve-day ritual, and they became the twenty-four half-months. Those very ones became the seven hundred and twenty hours.
3.326.12	She created this year-long sacrifice.
3.326.13	This indeed is the sacrifice, namely, the year.
3.326.14	She did not know whether she had released the sacrifice.
3.326.15	She thought, "Did I release it or not?"
3.326.16	Then Modah returned to her.
3.326.17	Then she knew, "I released the sacrifice."
3.326.18	She thought, “I released this sacrifice. Let me now create it in myself alone.”
3.327.1	With eight syllables he created the first day, with eleven the second, with twelve the third.
3.327.2	Only three syllables remained.
3.327.3	He created the next three days with those.
3.327.4	He created this six-day Prsthya (Satra).
3.327.5	He saw this six-day Paṣṭha sacrifice and thought, "By what can I construct this third three-day sacrifice?"
3.327.6	He saw his own self and thought, "This is my self."
3.327.7	"Let me construct it on my own self."
3.327.8	With eight syllables he created the seventh day, with eleven the eighth, with twelve the ninth.
3.327.9	And what syllable remained over, that became the tenth day of the twelve-day sacrifice.
3.327.10	This speech, exhausted and stretched out, is like a calf, like a lioness or a tigress or a panther.
3.327.11	If they were to sacrifice to her now, she would be too close.
3.327.12	Or if she were to come from this, she would come from everything.
3.327.13	They make her indirect, in the Anushtubh metre.
3.328.1	The Hotṛ does not recite the Anushtubh verse; he recites the Viraj verse.
3.328.2	Those gods said, "This is the sacrifice. Let us perform it with these (verses)."
3.328.3	They said to the Brihatī, "Do you bring us the third day.
3.328.4	The Abhijit is ours, but it is not covered."
3.328.5	The Brihatī indeed becomes the good (verse). When it becomes the Prstha (verse),
3.328.6	Having brought this Brihatī to the third day, she did not desire to bring it.
3.328.7	They conquered this world with Rathantara, the atmosphere with Brihatī, and this (heaven) with Bṛhat.
3.328.8	They conquered with this three-day (rite).
3.328.9	Just as the Sindhu horses, having won, carry the elephant, which is held by the driver, and the chariot goes with a jingling sound, so does the donkey-chariot go.
3.328.10	Thus the gods spent this second three-day period.
3.329.1	They brought back these forms: Vairupa, Vairat, Mahanama, and Revati.
3.329.2	Then Brihatī (the Great) took up Viraj, Shakvari and Revati.
3.329.3	They went beyond these.
3.329.4	The gods saw them as one would see a fish going along with the waves.
3.329.5	They sank together on the seventh day, as the fish sink together.
3.329.6	All these are combined in the Chandomas.
3.329.7	This is the great (hymn) in the Brihatī (metre). The Rathantara (hymn) is in the Brihatî.
3.329.8	Just as one would cross a deep and rapid stream, so did the gods cross this third three-day (rite).
3.329.9	They came to this heavenly world, this tenth day.
3.329.10	This indeed is the heavenly world, namely the tenth day.
3.329.11	It consists of twenty-four (verses).
3.329.12	Then that which is twentyfold is Viraj.
3.329.13	Then those four are the same as the expanse of the universe.
3.329.14	In that the gods milked all their desires.
3.329.15	He offers with the verse, "May the one who is near give to the mother, the mother who is near, the nourishment of wealth, food and energy, to us. Svāhā!"
3.329.16	He should meditate on the object of his desire.
3.329.17	When this is offered, that very desire is fulfilled for him, for one who knows this.
3.329.18	"What if it is not fulfilled for one who knows thus?" Thus did Shatayani say.
3.330.1	It goes, it comes, it is swift, it is full of knowledge, it is golden, it is radiant, it is yoked, the form of the first day, the Trivrit stoma, the Gayatri metre, the Rathantara Saman.
3.330.2	It is masculine, it is the slayer of Vritra, it is full op wealth, it is universal, it is present, the form of second day, the fifteen-fold stoma, the Tristubh metre, the Brihat Saman.
3.330.3	The form of the third pressing is that of Udvat, Trivat, Digvat, Gatvat, and Puraṇvat, and the Stoma of seventeen Stomas, the Jagati metre, and the Vairāja Sāman.
3.330.4	The form of the fourth pressing is that of Rajanvat, Janvat, Virāṭ, and Sūryanvat, and the Ekavimśa Stoma, the Anushtubh metre, and the Virāja Sāman.
3.330.5	The verses of the fifth day are like a picture, with children, with rows, with Śakvarī, with diminished syllables, with cows, with bulls, with thunderbolts, with Abhimat. The form of the fifth day is the form of the Trinava Stoma, the form of the Sakvara Sāman, the form of Pankti metre.
3.330.6	The Parivats, the Prativats, the Saptadas, the Dvipadās, the Vinarasamsa, the Gomats, the Vrshamats, the Vajryabhimats, the form of the sixth day, the Stoma of thirty-three, the Chhandas of Atichhandas, the Sama of Raivata.
3.331.1	Since this, though the same, is divided into six days and then becomes different, therefore the year is of different forms, and he is born in accordance with different forms.
3.331.2	"Agni" is the genitive case of the first day, "Agni" of the second, "Agni-na" of the third, "Agni-" of the fourth, "Agni-'s" of the fifth, and "Agni" again of the sixth.
3.331.3	These two are the two ends which are joined together.
3.331.4	This is the endless year.
3.331.5	Its two ends are the winter and the spring.
3.331.6	This is the end of the village, this is the end of a gold coin, this is the serpent lying down after having coiled around its coils.
3.331.7	This is food.
3.331.8	This is the wheel of gods, inexhaustible, new again, and it turns both ways.
3.331.9	He who knows this attains immortality, immortality, newness.
3.331.10-12	"O Agni, come hither, O Agni, with thy retinue!" - thus they invite him. By this (verse) they invite him. "We choose Agni as our messenger" - thus they choose him. By this they choose him. "Agni is kindled by Agni" - thus they kindle him. By this he is kindled. "Agni has shattered the foes" - thus they conquer by this.
3.332.2	They did not find it on the first day.
3.332.3	They did not find it in the second day.
3.332.4	They found it in the third day.
3.332.5	They only found it in the fourth day.
3.332.6	The later ones found it as it is.
3.332.7	Because this Agni-division is the same, but becomes different when these (Agni-divinities) enter (the fire).
3.332.8	And thus all seasons become Agni-possessed by means of these fires.
3.332.9	The first day is Prāsrīta-Ida, the second is Prārdha-Ida, the third is Paristubdha-Ida, the fourth is Ida-Ida, the fifth is Adhyardha-Ida, and the sixth is Abhyasta-Ida.
3.332.10	Then he asked, "What do you do on the first day?"
3.332.11	They replied, "We do Prāsrīti."
3.332.12	"What do you do in the second day?"
3.332.13	We shall dwell together."
3.332.14	What is the third?
3.332.15	"We shall cross over together."
3.332.16	What about the fourth?
3.332.17	"We have placed the good together."
3.332.18	What for the fifth?
3.332.19	"These are cutting off the cattle."
3.332.20	What for sixth?
3.332.21	They said, "Let us go."
3.332.22	"Then they said, 'Let us heal these cattle.'"
3.332.23	When he says, "I go," he goes forth.
3.332.24	The Iḍā of the first pressing is gone forth.
3.333.1	When they say, "We shall rest," they rest, as it were, or they rest, as if they were released.
3.333.2	For the Iḍā of second pressing comes to rest.
3.333.3	Now as to why he says, "We have indeed gone around the waters," for indeed he goes to the Iḍā-offering of the third pressing after having gone around.
3.333.4	And as to why he (the Adhvaryu) says, "Having placed the good with the good," he places the Iḍās with the Iḍās, the animals with the animals.
3.333.5	That is indeed placed with the good.
3.333.6	And as for why he says, “They cut off the animals,” for indeed this (Iḍā-offering) is cut off when it is half-way through the Iḍā offerings.
3.333.7	The animals are the Idā.
3.333.8	Therefore they enjoy the animals, their separation and their transformation.
3.333.9	And when he says, "We have come," he establishes himself in this very (earth).
3.333.10	And this is indeed the healing for those animals.
3.333.11	When this (earth) becomes different from that (sky), although it is the same, then animals become of different forms.
3.333.12	The various forms of the sacrifice are born from it.
3.333.13	What is begun with the Rk is the form of the first day.
3.333.14	The second day is surrounded by the Stuti, the third day is surrounded on both sides by the Stuti. The fourth day is elevated, the fifth day is repeated, the sixth day is repeated with the word "eha".
3.333.15	Because, though being the same, the declension of the word 'Indra' becomes different, therefore this wind blows according to the season, cold in winter and hot in summer.
3.333.16	The declension of the first day is 'Indra', of the second 'Indra', the third 'Indra', and the fourth 'Indra', then the fifth 'Indra', again the sixth 'Indra'.
3.333.17	Because this (universe) is one and the same, yet it becomes different according to the case of the genders, therefore the sun shines according to the season, cold in winter and hot in summer.
3.334.1	Thus indeed was this (universe) at first.
3.334.2	It desired, 'May I be many, may I propagate, may I attain to greatness.'
3.334.3	It thought, 'Let me be many, let me propagate, let me attain to greatness.' It became the mind.
3.334.4	It became the second, the other, the mind.
3.334.5	Therefore, the second one is called the other.
3.334.6	He tormented himself with that mind.
3.334.7	Mind indeed is austerity.
3.334.8	While tormenting himself, he created speech.
3.334.9	They said, "Praise me, praise me."
3.334.10	When he said, "Praise you," that became the nature of Stoma.
3.334.11	One who knows this, "He praises his own self, he is the best."
3.334.12	These two became the Stoma, the one going forward and the other going backward.
3.334.13	They are the two breaths, the Prāṇa and Apāna. They are the day and night. They are the bright and dark fortnights. They are these two worlds. They are Indra and Agni. They are Mitra and Varuna. They are the two Asvins. That divine pair is whatever is a pair here.
3.334.14	They are indeed the two Prajapatis.
3.334.15	This mind and speech indeed sprang up.
3.334.16	He is the golden embryo, the immortal.
3.334.17	This indeed is death, namely, Agni.
3.334.18	When they place gold in it, it becomes more auspicious.
3.334.19	This embryo was born.
3.334.20	He was wiped as a calf is wiped by its mother, from the iron.
3.335.1	What was his first membrane, that became iron.
3.335.2	What his second membrane, that became silver.
3.335.3	What his third membrane, that became gold.
3.335.4	Therefore it is the brightest.
3.335.5	That was its inner (form). But what was in the umbilical cord was
3.335.6	That became iron.
3.335.7	Therefore it is the most malodorous.
3.335.8	From that were born seventeen syllables.
3.335.9	They were divided into two groups, nine and eight.
3.335.10	That itself became the Trivṛt Stoma and the Gāyatrī metre.
3.335.11	He thought, "This is the Stoma, this is the metre. These two will be able to generate.
3.335.12	Let me say, 'Let these two generate."
3.335.13	Having praised with the Trivrt (Stoma), he said, "O Gāyatrī, be as much as you are capable of."
3.335.14	She became eight-syllabled. The syllables became three-syllabled.
3.335.15	And those became twenty-four.
3.335.16	He took six syllables for her twenty-four-syllable Gāyatrī.
3.336.1	It became a fifteen-stotra.
3.336.2	He took two more.
3.336.3	It became seventeen-stotra. 
3.336.4	He took four more.
3.336.5	It become twenty-one-stotra.
3.336.6	The Gāyatrī went to the Viṣuvant with half of that.
3.336.7	He took six more.
3.336.8	It became a Tri-navat stoma.
3.336.9	He took another six, it became a Tri-triṃśat stoma. 
3.336.10	He did not win anything beyond that.
3.336.11	He thought, "These very heroic stomas have been chanted and have come back. There are two days of Soma-drinking."
3.337.1	He combined the Trivṛt and Pañcadaśa.
3.337.2	That became the seventh day, consisting of twenty-four verses, with the Gāyatrī metre.
3.337.3	Therefore both the Bṛhat and Rathantara are performed here.
3.337.4	Because both these Stomas are Bṛhat and Rāthantara.
3.337.5	The Rathantara should be here in the Mātrā, then the Bṛhat is performed as the Pṛṣṭha.
3.337.6	and the seventeen and the twenty-three.
3.337.7	That itself became the fourth forty, the eighth day, with the Tristubh metre.
3.337.8	Therefore the Rathantara Sāman is performed here.
3.337.9	He joined the twenty-one and the thirty-three.
3.337.10	From that six syllables were exceeded.
3.337.11	Now those which remained forty-eight, that became the forty-eighth ninth day with the Jagati metre.
3.337.12	Therefore here the Brihat is performed as the Prstha.
3.337.13	For both these Stomas are of the Brihat kind. The Rathantara would have been in the mother's womb, but here the Brihat Prstha is performed.
3.338.1	He uttered these six syllables.
3.338.2	From that he created the six.
3.338.3	They became twelve.
3.338.4	He again uttered them.
3.338.5	From that, he created the six again.
3.338.6	They became eighteen.
3.338.7	He again created them.
3.338.8	From this, he created the eighteen again.
3.338.9	And those twenty-four became the twenty-fourth day.
3.338.10	And that twenty-fourth day became the tenth day with the Anushtubh metre.
3.338.11	Therefore, the Trihiṅkṛta Sāman.
3.338.12	They say, "The Stotras go beyond the Trivṛt, not the Gāyatrī metre."
3.338.13	One should say, "The Trivṛt Stotras do not go beyond, nor the Gāyatrīs."
3.338.14	The Stomas are three-fold, the Madhyas are three-fold and the Udayas are three-foll.
3.338.15	All the metres are included in this Gāyatrī.
3.338.16	This is the nourishment of the Stoma and the Gāyatrī metre. This is the twelve-fold.
3.338.17	This is indeed Brahman, the Gāyatrī.
3.338.18	The Trivṛt is the Ksatra.
3.338.19	By that thunderbolt, he conquers the Ksatra.
3.338.20	This is indeed Brahman and Kshatra. This is the twelve-day (rite).
3.338.21	They say, indeed, that Brahman is Trivrit, Brahman is Gayatri, Brahman is this twelve-day (ritual), and this entire twelve-day (rites) is indeed Brahman. One should know it thus.
3.338.22	There are these two verses on it:
3.338.23	Four are drawn first, yoked, they become six in the supreme heaven.
3.338.24	They fall down in pairs, with their wings, and having gone, they stand on this (earth) in some place.
3.338.25	Two Stomas sing the Gāyatrī, two sing the Tristubh and Jagatī.
3.338.26	From them the great one spread out, from the six; having gone, all stand on that.
3.339.1	Prajapati indeed was here first.
3.339.2	He desired, 'May I be many, may I beget, may I attain to the earth.'
3.339.3	He practised austerity.
3.339.4	He saw this sacrifice of twelve days, called Vyūḍha-chanda.
3.339.5	He brought it.
3.339.6	He performed it.
3.339.7	He arranged it.
3.339.8	When he arranged it, he arranged the limbs.
3.339.9	His bodies were these mortal creatures.
3.339.10	Then the Self became consisting of mind.
3.339.11	His body was mind, and the vital airs entered it.
3.339.12	It became like a stretched-out (body).
3.339.13	He said to the gods, "My body is not desired."
3.339.14	"How do you desire it?"
3.339.15	"Sacrifice with the Samūḍha-chanda-sastra for twelve days."
3.339.16	"So be it."
3.339.17	He performed the sacrifice of twelve days with the Samauhad (chant).
3.339.18	Whatever he united, that he united.
3.340.1	He became the mind-made, the life-made, the eye-made, the ear-made, the speech-made, the Rg-made, the Yajus-made, the Sama-made, the Brahma-made, the golden, the immortal, the Prajapati-made.
3.340.2	This is the lightning.
3.340.3	This is indeed the three Vedas.
3.340.4	The upward lightning is the Sāman, the downward lightning is the Ṛc, and the continuous humming is the Yajus.
3.340.5	He who knows this becomes indeed that deity.
3.340.6	This indeed is the deity, for the sacrifice is indeed praised.
3.340.7	If they were to ask, "Which deity is the most praised at the sacrifice?" one should say, "Lightning."
3.340.8	Indeed, this deity is the most praise at the sacrifice.
3.340.9	Therefore, if one were to perform the sacrifice with the Vyuha-chanda (twelve-day ritual),
3.340.10	one should perform it with the Samuha-chanda.
3.340.11	Indeed, one who knows this becomes blessed by both.
3.341.1	One indeed is the self-existent deity, namely Prajapati himself.
3.341.2	He desired, "Let me be many, let me be propagated."
3.341.3	He created the gods in this world by means of the three-fold Stoma, the Vasus.
3.341.4	They rushed upon him.
3.341.5	They ate him, saying, "Sweet, sweet."
3.341.6	They ate him as a calf would suck its mother.
3.341.7	He thought, 'If I am to be here, they will kill me. Let me go up.'
3.341.8	He thought, 'Let me create a fire so that those who think of me and see me may cease here.'
3.341.9	He created fire.
3.342.1	Having placed it in this world, he went up with the fifteen.
3.342.2	He went to where that wind was.
3.342.3	He created the Rudras there.
3.342.4	They all came together and fell upon him.
3.342.5	They were about to devour him.
3.342.6	He thought, "Let me ascend upwards."
3.342.7	He placed the wind in this world and ascended upwards with the seventeen.
3.342.8	He went to where the moon is.
3.342.9	He created the sun from that.
3.342.10	They followed him and fell upon him.
3.342.11	They wanted to eat him.
3.342.12	He thought, "Let me go upwards."
3.343.1	He went upwards with the Ekavimsa (stoma) having placed the moon in this world.
3.343.2	He went to where this sun is.
3.343.3	He created all the gods there.
3.343.4	They came together and fell down upon it.
3.343.5	They were about to eat it.
3.343.6	He thought, "Let me go up and escape."
3.343.7	Having thus established the sun in this world, he ascended upwards by the Triṇava (stotra).
3.343.8	He went to that place where Varuna was.
3.343.9	He did not release it.
3.343.10	He followed it.
3.343.11	They were about to eat it.
3.343.12	He thought, 'Let me ascend upwards.'
3.344.1	Having thus established Varuna in this world, he ascended to the heaven of the Thirty-three Gods.
3.344.2	He went to the place where Death was.
3.344.3	That became Death.
3.344.4	They made the mouth of that Death.
3.344.5	Having approached that Death which was all-round-faced, they remained indifferent and did not hold it.
3.344.6	He did not eat there.
3.344.7	He thought, "I am sin, I am death."
3.344.8	"Let me go upwards."
3.344.9	Having placed death in this world, he went upwards beyond the twenty-four.
3.344.10	He went to that world called Rochanas.
3.344.11	That became his food.
3.344.12	Those who were afraid did not follow him in eating.
3.344.13	Those who were examining stood there, saying, "This shines, this shines."
3.344.14	That is his shining.
3.344.15	He thought, "I am sin, since I am eating."
3.344.16	"Let me go upward."
3.344.17	Having thus set aside death in this world, he went up through the four directions.
3.344.18	He went to that world called Rochanas.
3.344.19	That became food.
3.344.20	Those who were afraid of it did not follow it.
3.344.21	They stood observing it, saying, "This shines, this shines."
3.344.22	That is his shining.
3.344.23	He thought, "I am sinful, since I am hungry."
3.344.24	"Let me go upwards."
3.344.25	He placed them in the day and night.
3.344.26	They became thirst and hunger.
3.344.27	Hunger is the day, thirst is the night.
3.344.28	Just as when a door is closed, the two sides of the door are joined together, so also these two days and nights are joined together for the purpose of non-transgression.
3.344.29	But those who know thus, they indeed transgress.
3.345.1	Having placed these two days and two nights in this world, he ascended upwards by forty-four.
3.345.2	He went to that world which is called Kāma.
3.345.3	Then, without any other sound, he created the rivers for the removal of this sin.
3.345.4	They became the wish-yielding cows.
3.345.5	He thought, "Let me now ascend upwards."
3.345.6	He ascended upwards by forty-eight.
3.345.7	He went to the world called Suvar.
3.345.8	That he did not enjoy in that (world), because his own (property) was abundant.
3.345.9	He had a good son.
3.345.10	He thought, 'Let me collect one world from these worlds.'
3.345.11	He collected one world from these (worlds).
3.345.12	That became the tenth day of the twelve-day sacrifice.
3.345.13	He said, 'This did not become mine.'
3.345.14	What he said, "This was not done by me," that is the nature of the sky.
3.345.15	This indeed is the sky, the tenth day, this is heaven, this is the expanse of the Brahman.
3.346.1	Just as one would look down from a tree or a mountain, in the same way one looks down from this world to other worlds.
3.346.2	He saw these creatures seeking food.
3.346.3	They fled from him in two forms, blue and golden.
3.346.4	What is dark when it is about to rain is blue.
3.346.5	And what shines in the water is golden.
3.346.6	He rained on them.
3.346.7	From that, rice was born.
3.346.8	Having eaten it, he became satisfied.
3.346.9	He became Udan.
3.346.10	That is the reason for Udan being called Udan.
3.346.11	Udan is indeed his name.
3.346.12	They call him Udan indirectly.
3.346.13	The second, the greater, was born as food.
3.346.14	They came together and pounded it.
3.346.15	It became Mantha.
3.346.16	That is why Mantha is called Mantha.
3.346.17	This is the form of food, what one eats and what one drinks.
3.346.18	What one eats is the form of rice, what one drinks is the form of gruel.
3.346.19	One who knows this obtains both of these in his house.
3.346.20	These two are indeed the breasts of Prajapati, namely, rice and barley.
3.346.21	By them he nourishes these creatures.
3.347.1	That world is called Upodaka, in which this fire is.
3.347.2	Then the world called Rtadhama, in which the wind is.
3.347.3	Then Shiva, in which the moon is.
3.347.4	Then Aparajita, in which the sun is.
3.347.5	Then Adhidyu, in which Varuna is.
3.347.6	Then Pradyu, in which Death is.
3.347.7	Then Rochaka, in which food is.
3.347.8	Therefore, the day and night are not connected with it. It is indeed only once that one enters it. It is as if it were the form of lightning or the fire of burning wood.
3.347.9	And indeed these are the worlds of Prajapati above it.
3.347.10	Desire is the eighth, heaven the ninth, and the sky the tenth day.
3.347.11	This is the way of passing away and returning.
3.347.12	These are the worlds, these are the twelve days of the twelve-day sacrifice.
3.347.13	He who knows this thus, these indeed are his worlds.
3.348.1	The world named "Upodaka" is filled with food, men are the guardians, Agni is the lord, the form of the flames is its form, established in water.
3.348.2	The world called Ritadhama is pervaded by the Vayu-s, the Gandharva-s and the Apsara-s are the protectors, Vayu is the lord, the white form is established in the Prāṇa.
3.348.3	The world called Aparajita is pervaded by stars, the Moon is the protector, the Sun is the lord, whatever form of the Sun is raised, and whatever form of the setting Sun, that form is established in Manas.
3.348.4	The world called Adhi-dyu, the sacrifice, the guardians are the Adityas, Varuna is the lord, the blue colour of Parjanya when about to rain, that is blue. Or the blue is the gem of the Kārta-svara. He is established in untruth.
3.348.5	The world called Pradyu is pervaded by immortality. The Rudras are the guardians. Death is the lord. The color is red. The garment is of gold. The garment is worn without the Maaharohaṇa. Whatever is not established in that, it does not reach.
3.348.6	The world called Rochanas, the Vasus are the protectors, they are the first of the gods to have attained heaven. Therefore they are the most excellent. Sacrifice is the lord. The form of gold is the form of truth.
3.348.7	These are the worlds, these are the protectors, these are the lords.
3.348.8	These indeed are his worlds, these are his lords, for him who knows thus.
3.349.1	Prajapati created the gods.
3.349.2	He created them together with Shri, speech, and food, and together with water.
3.349.3	Those gods, knowing food as Shri, were as if enjoying together with speech. For food is Shri. He lamented.
3.349.4	He thought, "How can I obtain these Shris?"
3.349.5	He entered them, becoming their mind.
3.349.6	He took from them all their glory, as one might take badara berries.
3.349.7	He took their speech with his mind.
3.349.8	This is the speech that is taken with the mind today.
3.349.9	Whatever one desires with the mind, one speaks with the voice.
3.349.10	He thought, "By what form should I take up speech?"
3.349.11	He assumed the form of a man.
3.349.12	He took up speech in the form of a human being.
3.349.13	Therefore, a man speaks all words.
3.349.14	He gathered these waters and ascended.
3.349.15	He went to the world called "Bull," which is the food.
3.349.16	That food is the bull.
3.349.17	When he eats, then he is the bull.
3.349.18	He thought, "What form should I make so that no one else would ascend me?"
3.349.19	He became the spotted goat.
3.349.20	Therefore, we do not attain the spotted goat. That is the goat.
3.349.21	Those waters which he brought, those are the waters above.
3.349.22	Then that speech which he took away, which is the rumbling sound above, that is the same speech. And that which shines in the waters below,
3.349.23	He looked at these creatures who were starving,
3.350.1	Mumbling in the darkness.
3.350.2	He cut off one syllable of that speech and released it as 'speech'.
3.350.3	Having fallen, he settled in the middle of these worlds.
3.350.4	This became the circle.
3.350.5	He followed that.
3.350.6	He became Prāṇa.
3.350.7	He separated from them.
3.350.8	He thought, "I will let out a little bit of water from these waters, to see how much is enough for them."
3.350.9	He became tenfold, a hundredfold, a thousandfold, as much as this earth.
3.350.10	He became that and then pounded it.
3.350.11	That became porridge.
3.350.12	That is the porridge-ness of porridge.
3.350.13	Having eaten it, he became satisfied.
3.350.14	He became satisfied.
3.350.15	That is satisfaction-ness of satisfaction.
3.350.16	This is the two-fold form of food, what one drinks and what one eats.
3.350.17	What one drinks is the form of gruel, what one eats is the form of rice.
3.350.18	One who knows this, obtains both, what one drinks or what one eats.
3.350.19	They say, three streams come down: the stream of water, the stream of ghee, and the stream of honey.
3.350.20	Of these, the stream of water enters these plants, the stream of honey the trees.
3.350.21-23	They, the students of the Veda, discussed this matter: Amala, Akūpayeya, Hīna, Aśvatthi, Keśi, Dārbhya, and Kiṃstoka. "What do you think, O Kiṃstoka, are you coming slowly? What do you think, are you coming very slowly? What do you think, are you very slowly coming?" He said, "I think I am coming slowly with ghee." Then Hīna said, "I am coming slowly with honey."
3.350.24	Then he said, "I think that the Amalaka is the best."
3.350.25	And they indeed made it the best.
3.350.26	Everything here is born in water.
3.350.27	That speech which he uttered, that is Agni.
3.350.28	And that breath which he followed, that is Indra.
3.350.29	Now he who is the progenitor of creatures, the bull, in the world of fire, in the waters, within.
3.351.1	He is indeed the moon.
3.351.2	He is the Prajapati.
3.351.3	That is the light created beyond and below, shining, standing, Agni and Indra.
3.351.4	That is this in the body.
3.351.5	That is indeed the speech, this is the speech, this Prāṇa is above it.
3.351.6	Now he who is the creator of beings, the bull, in the world of fire, in the waters, that is this Purusha.
3.351.7	These are the same deities here and hereafter.
3.351.8	They go here and they go there.
3.351.9	Those who are these are those, and those who are those are these.
3.351.10	He who worships them as existing within himself becomes a deity.
3.351.11	Now, these gods, the Prajapatis, are present in their own selves.
3.351.12	Now, these vital airs are present in this man in their own selves
3.351.13	They protect this man, having taken him around.
3.351.14	This is the verse about him:
3.351.15	The bull is the world, the great Yakshas. It was not before him nor after him.
3.351.16	The god whom the gods, holding the vital airs, guard while awake, he knows the world, the great Person.
3.351.17	Thus it is said.
3.351.18	Indeed, the gods, holding this god, the vital airs, the Person, guard while awake.
3.351.19	He who is the eye, he is indeed the dwarf.
3.351.20	He who worships him as the dwarf, that deity makes him go to the left, to the left.
3.351.21	From this (world) indeed, O son of a noble family, the Vāmaṇa is desired by some.
3.351.22	This deity knows him by his name.
3.351.23	He does not age.
3.351.24	He is equal to the young and the old.
3.351.25	He, having withdrawn the vital airs, having shaken off the body, ascends upwards with the vital airs.
3.351.26	By this (rite) indeed he takes away the bodies of the dead which have been overcome.
3.351.27	For that deity, as a lump of clay is placed on a stick, so are the feet placed on the heart.
3.351.28	When he cuts them off, then he dies.
3.351.29	Even the ignorant say, 'He cuts it off.'
3.351.30	He who knows this, the immortal, does not depart from him. He attains the full span of life.
3.352.1	The gods, by means of exertion, austerity, and good conduct, overcame the Asuras and Rakshasas.
3.352.2	The Asuras, knowing that they were defeated, assumed female forms, and the first-born, the Candātakavasīnis, the most excellent of forms.
3.352.3	They returned to the gods.
3.352.4	The gods handed them over.
3.352.5	For no one dislikes women.
3.352.6	Whatever energy, strength, and vigor they had attained through exertion, they poured into them.
3.352.7	The Asuras, knowing this, fled, thinking, "This much was their energy, strength, vigor."
3.352.8	The gods were displeased with them.
3.352.9	They thought, "We are being cheated."
3.352.10	They said, "How can we regain this power, energy, and strength?"
3.352.11	They saw these Vyahrtis.
3.353.1	They approached him with the monosyllable and took the Rathantara.
3.353.2	Therefore it is performed on the first day.
3.353.3	With the two syllables "pra" and "me" he takes the great (earth).
3.353.4	Therefore it is done on the second day.
3.353.5	With the three syllables "prati" and "me", he takes the deformed (earth).
3.353.6	So it is done on third day.
3.353.7	With four syllables "asrivag", he takes the Vairaja (earth).
3.353.8	Thus it is done on fourth day.
3.353.9	With the five-syllabled mantra "Sirakamasi" one takes up the Shakra (verse).
3.353.10	Therefore, it is performed on the fifth day.
3.353.11	With the six-syllabled "Chardhirindra-avad" one takes up Raivata.
3.353.12	Therefore, it takes place on the sixth day.
3.353.13	With "Agayam varam yonim dadhvam vidvaj janasya chaye" one takes up Vamadevya.
3.353.14	Therefore it is performed in the middle of the sacrifice.
3.353.15	"They took up the Yajñāyajñiya hymn, saying, "What has fallen beyond the womb, that do ye place in the Vasus."
3.353.16	Therefore it is performed at the end of the sacrifice."
3.354.1	"They say, "The gods are free from sin."
3.354.2	They do not sleep."
3.354.3	They were overcome by the burden of fatigue.
3.354.4	While they were sleeping, the Asuras took away their lustre, power, and strength and deposited them in the waters.
3.354.5	Vishnu saw them.
3.354.6	The gods who had awakened were unhappy.
3.354.7	Vishnu said to them, "Let not your unhappiness be.
3.354.8	I have seen it."
3.354.9	He brought them into the waters.
3.354.10	They saw them within the waters, as if a hump were raised from the back.
3.354.11	They took them with these very Vyāhṛtis and offered them to Viṣṇu.
3.354.12	Viṣṇu, holding that radiance, power, and strength, attained equality.
3.354.13	Therefore Viṣṇu is short.
3.354.14	Therefore, they offer a short-necked cow to Vishnu.
3.354.15	Where he went, holding it, that became the Vishnu-pad.
3.354.16	Therefore, the sacrifice of the one who is in the Vishnu-pad, the Kaikeya, is the one who is to be offered.
3.354.17	For they found this sacrifice in him.
3.354.18	He who knows this gives away the brilliance, strength and energy of his enemies.
3.355.1	Prajapati created these worlds and these directions.
3.355.2	Having created them, he created the gods and the Asuras.
3.355.3	He found them equal.
3.355.4	They entrusted the Brahman to Prajapati.
3.355.5	That did not increase.
3.355.6	He introduced it into the waters.
3.355.7	The gods conquered the Asuras.
3.355.8	Having conquered, they returned and said to Prajapati, "Whatever Brahman we have in you, that you give to us."
3.355.9	He said, "I did not accept that."
3.355.10	"I put it into the waters."
3.355.11	He brought them back into the waters.
3.355.12	They saw it within the waters, as if a tail were raised from the back.
3.355.13	They said, "Let us create from here."
3.355.14	They created this with the syllable "Om."
3.356.1	They created the Rathantara hymn for the eastern direction.
3.356.2	The sound of Agni followed it.
3.356.3	Therefore, they churn the fires for the Rathantara hymn.
3.356.4	With this syllable "Om" they created the great light of this southern direction.
3.356.5	The sound of Parjanya followed it.
3.356.6	Therefore, at the Brihat Stotra, they beat drums.
3.356.7	Parjanya becomes a rain-giver.
3.356.8	With this syllable "Om" they created the variegated light for the western direction.
3.356.9	The sound of Vayu was created from that.
3.356.10	Therefore, they perform the Adhvayir Adhuna rites for Vaivarupa.
3.356.11	One who comes from below the wind.
3.356.12	With this syllable "Om", they created the variegated radiance for the northern direction.
3.356.13	The sound of the Vyasas was produced from that.
3.356.14	Therefore, just as the Vyasas again speak with the voice, so the Vairāja praises again as if with the voice.
3.356.15	With this very syllable "Om", they produced the light of Shakra in the upward direction.
3.356.16	The sound of the waters was produced from that.
3.356.17	Therefore, at the end of the hymn to Śākvara, they recite the hymn after placing the oblation.
3.356.18	With this very syllable "Om", they generated the light of Raivata in that direction.
3.356.19	From that, the sound of cattle was generated.
3.356.20	Therefore, at the end the hymn to Raivata, they make the sound of cattle and let the calves graze with their mothers.
3.356.21	They said, "We know from where these have come forth."
3.356.22	They saw Vamadevya in the waters.
3.356.23	They took it.
3.356.24	All the words were created from it, each one separately.
3.356.25	These are the created verses, which shine from the directions.
3.356.26	They were indeed shining then.
3.356.27	He shines for his own self. They call him who knows thus, 'He who shines.'
3.356.28	He meditated on this deity.
3.356.29	She who shines forth in front, she was then in the form of a man.
3.356.30	She took up the Rathantara tone with the Trivrt stoma and the Gayatri metre.
3.356.31	He placed it here.
3.356.32	With the fifteen-fold Stoma and the Tristubh metre, he took the light of the Brihat.
3.356.33	He placed it here.
3.356.34	With the seventeen-fold Stoma, the Jagati metre and the Vairupa, he took the lights.
3.356.35	He placed them here.
3.356.36	With twenty-one-fold Stoma the Anushtubh metre and the Vaisharadja, he took the rays.
3.356.37	He placed here.
3.356.38	With the twenty-seventh Stoma and the Pankti metre, he took the rays of Shakra.
3.356.39	He placed it here.
3.356.40	With the thirty-three Stoma and the Atichhanda metre, he took up the rays of Raivata.
3.356.41	He placed them here.
3.356.42	Therefore all beings are established in the waters at the end.
3.356.43	They said, "He took it up, he took it up."
3.356.44	That is the sun's sunniness.
3.356.45	The sun's power is the sun' s power. He who knows this releases the sun's blemish, which is censured.
3.357.1	All beings go to him, saying, "He is the lord, he is the lord."
3.357.2	That is the sun'ssunniness.
3.357.3	This is indeed the sun.
3.357.4	The sun is called the sun indirectly.
3.357.5	"He is our lord, he is our master," thus his own people and the singers worship him, he who knows thus.
3.357.6	When he, having taken the Prāgvarṣa, sang, that was the sovereignty of the Sūrya.
3.357.7	That indeed is the sovereignty of the Svaras, when he sang.
3.357.8	Those gods said, "He did not please us."
3.357.9	That day became the Prāgvara.
3.357.10	"It was night for him, it was night for him." That very night became the night.
3.357.11	This is indeed the origin of day and night.
3.357.12	He who knows this origin of day and Night, attains day and night. They do not pass him by.
3.357.13	All this indeed has an end.
3.357.14	These alone are without an end, namely, day and night.
3.357.15	Those who have this (world) when it is turned around, obtain everything.
3.357.16	Just as a man standing on the axle of a chariot would look around, in the same way, these day and night stand in the world of the sun and look around.
3.357.17	He said to his father, Prajapati, "Give me this brilliance, power, and strength."
3.357.18	"So be it."
3.357.19	He gave it to him.
3.357.20	Therefore, the father, living, gives his wealth to his son.
3.358.1	He took the power of the heaven, the power of the stars, the power of men, the power of cattle, the power of water, the power of plants, the power of trees, the power of youth, the power of Agni, the power of earth, the power of gold, the power of speech, the power of ancestors, the power of moon.
3.358.2	Now, that which he took from these beings, that is the Aditya's Aditya-hood.
3.358.3	He takes away the brilliance of his enemies, he who knows this.
3.358.4	This is the deity, the initiated one, with the black antelope skin.
3.358.5	The rays that are below are the beard, and those that are above are the hair.
3.358.6	The black antelope skin is the day and night.
3.358.7	Because they made it a sacrifice to the gods, therefore it is called Diksita.
3.358.8	He who sacrifices makes a sacrifice to the heaven.
3.358.9	He who knows this conquers the victory and prosperity that he conquers by means of the Diksita rite.
3.359.1	His wife is like the moon, and Soma is his drink.
3.359.2	Therefore one should perform the Diksita ceremony with one's wife.
3.359.3	That deity takes away the lustre, energy, strength and fame of one who is being initiated.
3.359.4	One who is about to be initiated should pray to the sun: "You are the deity who has been initiated."
3.359.5	It takes away the lustre and energy of one who is about to give gifts.
3.359.6	Do not take away my lustre, energy, and strength.
3.359.7	I follow your initiation."
3.359.8	This is the deity of one being initiated. It does not give away his brilliance, power, strength, fame and sound.
3.359.9	This is the praise of the Udgitha.
3.359.10	Those rays which are below, by them these worlds are stabilized. Whatever is below this, and whatever is living, with the body.
3.359.11	Now those (gods) who are above, they are his (Agni's) firm worlds, and those who are beyond them, and whatever is inanimate.
3.359.12	Now that this deity stands between the gods and the Asuras, that is why it is a pillar.
3.359.13	He indeed is firm, he who makes firm.
3.359.14	Then, if someone were to ask him about the one who is firm, he should say, "I am offering you to the deity who is firm, so that you may be free from misfortune."
3.359.15	He is freed from misfortune.
3.359.16	Those rays that are below are indeed the ones that lead to death.
3.359.17	And those that are above are indeed the ones leading to the world of the deathless.
3.359.18	Those rays which are below are called the Horyas. They are like the tail of a horse.
3.359.19	Those which are above are called the Upariyas.
3.359.20	Just as an elephant, having taken hold of a man with his trunk, would throw him on his back, in the same way this deity, knowing this, takes hold of the one who knows this with its rays and throws him on its back.
3.360.4	When that was not, then there was nothing. Then the luminous truth arose. The luminous truth arose. Luminous heat arose.
3.360.5	What is truth is speech. What is truth is the breath of life. What is heat is the mind.
3.360.6	Among them, food was the light.
3.360.7	They became one.
3.360.8	That one, having become one, nourished itself with that food and light.
3.360.9	It became like honey mixed with curds, like a drop of water.
3.360.10	It thought, "Let me make the breath below."
3.360.11	It made the breath below, like the sky below a woman.
3.360.12	Therefore, the waters were created by this speech, "Strength and weakness."
3.360.13	That great mass of water was here.
3.360.14	What is said here, "The waters were here, the great mass of water," those are the waters.
3.360.15	They were the waves, and they were the Phālfāślīti.
3.360.16	That golden egg was found.
3.361.1	His lower lip was green, the upper one was silver.
3.361.2	He lay there for a hundred years of the gods, or a thousand years of Dyu, and then he broke open.
3.361.3	There were indeed Dyu-s at that time.
3.361.4	As long as this year is, so long are the years of the image.
3.361.5	They know the year by the Dyu-s.
3.361.6	Then indeed, before the day and night were joined together, they were not yet differentiated.
3.361.7	They knew that as a year.
3.361.8	Then indeed, before the days and nights were joined together,
3.361.9	they were not yet differentiated, they were differentiated by the Agnihotra alone.
3.361.10	It was differentiated by this speech, when the ladle was placed, when the two cups were placed, when the skull was placed.
3.361.11	Which world did she enter?
3.361.12	"He said, 'Phaḍ!' and the egg was broken."
3.361.13	The lower half of it became this earth.
3.361.14	The upper half became this heaven.
3.361.15	What was in between became this atmosphere.
3.361.16	The speech he uttered while being born became the three Vedas.
3.361.17	Whatever deity he was when he was born, that he became.
3.361.18	He thought, "I have created this great foundation, the worlds.
3.361.19	Whatever I create from here, that will be the foundation.
3.361.20	Let me create."
3.361.21	He thought of himself in his mind.
3.361.22	In that (world) the two spring months, Dvapas, were produced.
3.362.1	He said to them, "You should create."
3.362.2	"Which direction?"
3.362.3	"This one."
3.362.4	They created with the word "Om."
3.362.5	That was their food, that was their light, they heated each other with that.
3.362.6	Then they became the kingdom.
3.362.7	The nation indeed is he who knows thus.
3.362.8	He again knew himself by mind.
3.362.9	In that (self) two drops were produced, the two summer months.
3.362.10	He said to them, "Beget."
3.362.11	"Which direction?"
3.362.12	"This one."
3.362.13	They were begotten by this very speech "Om".
3.362.14	They fell down in this direction and stood up.
3.362.15	They produced the great light.
3.362.16	That was their food, that was their light, that they heated with that.
3.362.17	Then they became a kingdom.
3.362.18	One who knows this becomes a kingdom.
3.362.19	He again knew himself by mind.
3.362.20	In that (world) the two summer months, Dvapas, were produced.
3.362.21	He said to them, "Beget."
3.362.22	"Which direction?"
3.362.23	"This one."
3.362.24	They were produced by this very speech, "Om."
3.362.25	Having fallen in this direction, they stood firm.
3.362.26	The two bright ones were produced in that direction.
3.362.27	That was their food, that was their light, and by that they were warmed.
3.362.28	Then they became a kingdom.
3.362.29	One who speaks thus becomes a kingdom.
3.362.30	He again knew himself by his mind.
3.362.31	In it two drops were produced, the two rainy months.
3.362.32	He said to them, "Beget."
3.362.33	Which direction did they go to?
3.362.34	This one.
3.362.35	They were created by this very speech, "Om."
3.362.36	Having fallen in this direction, they became established.
3.362.37	Those two created the light of the sun.
3.362.38	That was their food, that was their light, that illuminated them.
3.362.39	Then they became a kingdom.
3.362.40	The nation indeed is he who knows this.
3.362.41	He again knew himself by his mind.
3.362.42	In it two drops were produced, the two autumnal months.
3.362.43	He said to them, "Beget."
3.362.44	"Which direction?"
3.362.45	"This one."
3.362.46	They were produced by this very speech, "Om."
3.362.47	They fell down in this direction and stood up.
3.362.48	They generated the light of the Vaivasvata Manu.
3.362.49	That was their food, that was their light, that they heated with these two.
3.362.50	Then they became a kingdom.
3.362.51	One who knows this becomes a kingdom.
3.362.52	He again knew himself by mind.
3.362.53	In that (world) two drops were produced, the two winter months.
3.362.54	He said to them, "You should be created."
3.362.55	They were created by this very speech, "Om."
3.362.56	Having fallen in this direction, they stood firm.
3.362.57	They created the light of Shakra in this direction.
3.362.58	That was their food, that was their light, and by that they were warmed.
3.362.59	Then they became a kingdom.
3.362.60	He who knows this becomes a kingdom.
3.362.61	Then he again knew himself by his mind.
3.362.62	In that (mind) two drops were produced, the two months of winter.
3.362.63	He said to them, 'Beget.'
3.362.64	Which direction did they go to?
3.362.65	This one.
3.362.66	They were created by this very word 'Om'.
3.362.67	They fell in this direction and stood up.
3.362.68	They created the sun in that direction.
3.362.69	That was their food, that was their light, that illuminated them.
3.362.70	Then they became a kingdom.
3.362.71	The nation indeed prospers for him who knows thus.
3.363.1	Then he approached with the Jṛmbhā (verses).
3.363.2	Therefore animals approach with the Jṛmbha verses in the winter season.
3.363.3	He thought, "If I create this triad, it will be destroyed. Let me create from it."
3.363.4	He approached the Gayatri with the Trivrt stoma.
3.363.5	From that he created the Vasus.
3.363.6	They went to this direction.
3.363.7	He attained the Tristubh with the fifteen-fold Stoma.
3.363.8	Then he created the Rudras.
3.363.9	They went to this direction
3.363.10	He attained the Jagati with the seventeen-fold Stoma
3.363.11	Then he created Adityas.
3.363.12	They went in this direction.
3.363.13	With the twenty-one-fold Jagati,
3.363.14	Then he created Aditya.
3.363.15	They went to this direction.
3.363.16	With the Ekavimsa stoma he studied the Anushtubh.
3.363.17	Then he created the Visve Devas.
3.363.18	They went to this direction
3.363.19	With the Trinava stoma he studied Panka.
3.363.20	Then he produced the Maruts.
3.363.21	They went in this direction.
3.363.22	He studied the Atichhandas with the Trayastrimsa stoma.
3.363.23	Then he created the Sadhyas and the Aptyas.
3.363.24	They went to this direction.
3.364.1	These deities, created, are the Stotras, the metres, the seasons, and the Grahas.
3.364.2	Each of them stood separately with their own splendour, and did not stand for the supremacy of the other.
3.364.3	They said, "Let us not stand for the superiority of one over the other.
3.364.4	We want him who will be our lord."
3.364.5	They went to Prajapati, their creator, and said, "We will not stand for one another to be the best."
3.364.6	"Create us so that we will be the lords."
3.364.7	Prajapati said, "This much of power, energy, and strength was in me when I created you.
3.364.8	They should perform austerities for a year.
3.364.9	Having performed austerities for a whole year, they should approach. What one attains, what one attains, what is one?
3.364.10	They performed austerities for one year.
3.364.11	Having completed that year, they approached.
3.364.12	What one attained, what one attained, what is one, they poured it into his mind and womb.
3.364.13	Then Indra arose.
3.364.14	This is recited.
3.364.15	"They say, 'He went from the horse,' and they think he was born from strength."
3.364.16	"He went from the mind to the mansions, from where Indra knows he was born."
3.364.17	"Thus."
3.364.18	"He said, 'He went to the mind,' because they poured him into the mind's womb."
3.364.19	"He stood in the mansions," the heart is called the mansion.
3.364.20	The heart indeed is angry.
3.364.21	"He is born of strength, and of mind, they think."
3.365.1	"The assembly asked him, 'You indeed saw Indra being born.'
3.365.2	He said this:
3.365.3	" "He went from the horse," they say. "He is born of the strength, and of the mind, they think."
3.365.4	He went from the mind, stood in the house, from where Indra was born, he knows.
3.365.5	Thus, he said, "I think that Ojas was born from this."
3.365.6	Indra alone knows from where he was born."
3.365.7	Having removed the head, he looked at it.
3.365.8	He saw that all of this was covered.
3.365.9	He said, "Whatever is covered here, which world should I be born into? Please give it to me."
3.365.10	"These two are mine."
3.366.1	"Give me the two spring months."
3.366.2	"I give you these two," he said, and took the Rathantara from the east, which is the direction of the fallen, and which is food.
3.366.3	He placed it here.
3.366.4	He who knows this, gives strength to the two.
3.366.5	He entered it again.
3.366.6	He said to him, "Be born again."
3.366.7	He said, "Give me that." "Give me the two summer months."
3.366.8	"I give you these two." "Food, food," and having fallen down, he took the bright light from the southern direction.
3.366.9	He placed it here.
3.366.10	He who knows this gives the strength of the four.
3.366.11	He again entered it.
3.366.12	He said to him, "Be born!"
3.366.13	He said, "Give me the two months of the rainy season."
3.366.14	"I give you these two," he said, and he took the form of the food that fell in the direction of the setting sun.
3.366.15	He placed it here.
3.366.16	He who knows this gives the strength of the six seasons.
3.366.17	He entered it again.
3.366.18	He said to him, "O son of Jayamvati!"
3.366.19	He said, "He gives me this, or he gives me these two autumn months."
3.366.20	"I give you these two." The one who fell down took the radiance of the Viraj direction in the north.
3.366.21	He placed it here.
3.366.22	The one who knows this gives the strength of eight.
3.366.23	He entered it again.
3.366.24	He said to him, "Be born."
3.366.25	He said, "He gives me only that. He gives me only the two winter months.
3.366.26	"These two give you food." Having fallen down, he took the food of the eastern direction from the Shakra.
3.366.27	He placed it here.
3.366.28	He who knows this gives the strength of ten.
3.366.29	He entered it again.
3.366.30	He said to him, "Be born again."
3.366.31	He said, "Give me the two winter months."
3.366.32	"I give you these two," he said, and having fallen down, he took the rays of the sun in the direction of Raivata.
3.366.33	He placed it here.
3.366.34	He who knows this gives the strength of twelve.
3.366.35	He thought, "How can I grasp these seasons?"
3.367.1	He saw them lying down with their heads towards the east.
3.367.2	He grasped them with his head, arms, and feet, with his arms towards the east, with his feet towards the west, and with his back and shoulders towards the north.
3.367.3	Having grasped them thus, he turned them upside down.
3.367.4	He shines in the seasons and in the year, having mounted on this glory.
3.367.5	He again entered it with all this.
3.367.6	He said to him, "You alone were not able to rise up before.
3.367.7	You will not be able to rise up with all this. Be born again."
3.367.8	In that he saw the waters flowing.
3.367.9	He said, "He will give me this, or he will give me water, and then I will be born."
3.367.10	He gave him six thousand measures of water.
3.367.11	This is the verse about him:
3.367.12	No one else can cross them, nor is he worthy to drink them.
3.367.13	Honey, milk, ghee, curd, and six thousand measures of amba water are carried in him.
3.367.14	Thus.
3.367.15	These are indeed the names of the directions.
3.367.16	These alone pour out a thousand to him, these alone satisfy him.
3.367.17	He was born.
3.367.18	He, being born, praised himself: "I am born, the lord of the seven animals, the supporter of the seven directions, the born, the generator, the protector, the born."
3.367.19	He praised himself, saying, "I am the protector."
3.367.20	He who knows this becomes the best.
3.367.21	When he was born, they placed this royal throne for him.
3.367.22	On it they consecrated him.
3.368.1	The Vasus for kingship, the Rudras for Vaisharadya, the Adityas for self-sovereignty, the Vishva-devas for sovereignty, the Maruts for universal lordship, the Sadhyas and Aptyas for Parameshthya.
3.368.2	Thus he was, and his father, Prajapati, himself desired him.
3.368.3	He said to the Vasus, "Give me this."
3.368.4	They said, "We cannot, for Prajapati is our father."
3.368.5	He said to Rudra, but they did not desire it.
3.368.6	He said it to the Adityas, but they did also not desire it.
3.368.7	Then the Maruts said, "What will be ours from this?"
3.368.8	"Whatever is mine, the midday pressing, that will be yours in common with me."
3.368.9	"So be it."
3.368.10	They gave him the morning pressing.
3.368.11	He said, "My moon, my moon," and they said, "This is your moon." He took the brilliance by which he shines.
3.368.12	When he said, "This is the moon," it became the moon.
3.368.13	When he again and again took it, it remained just as it was.
3.368.14	Therefore, even today, there is a radiance in it.
3.368.15	Just as it shines during the day, so it shines at night.
3.368.16	He knew, "This is inexhaustible."
3.368.17	He saw him.
3.368.18	He said to him, "Do not be remorseful about it."
3.368.19	He said, "No, I will be remorseful about this."
3.368.20	Therefore they see him on both days and nights.
3.368.21	They indeed torment him.
3.368.22	These two, the moon and the sun, are indeed father and son.
3.368.23	The father is the moon, the son is the sun.
3.368.24	The moon is the other, the sun is the other.
3.368.25	These two have attained the highest position among all the deities.
3.368.26	Just as these two have attained the supreme position among all the gods, in the same way one who knows this attains the supreme position among his own people.
3.368.27	Thus it is about the deity. Now about the inner self:
3.368.28	This very moon, this very sun.
3.368.29	Thus one should meditate on the Self.
3.368.30	That is the same as Bhṛgu-eye.
3.368.31	One should say to him whom one hates, "May you be seen by Bhṛgu-Eye."
3.368.32	He does not become like an object of enjoyment.
3.369.1	When the Vedas worshipped, Brihaty alone sang for them.
3.369.2	Then the two northern Prāgāthas became the Prastôtṛ and Pratihâra.
3.369.3	The householder Amitchanda, Viraj, Brahma, Gâyatrî, the Maitrâvaruna, Jagatî, the Hotri, Pankti, the Adhvaryu.
3.369.4	His fifth position is that of the Pratiprasthātṛ, the Tristubh is the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, the Uṣṇik and Kakubha are the Chhandasī, the Neṣṭa and Āptora are the Anushtubh, the Acchavāka is the Dvipadonneta, the Aksarapankti is the Gravastut, the Ekapadā is the Subrahmaṇya, the Atichandas is the Agnidhra.
3.369.5	This sacrifice of twelve days is indeed the Gāyatrī, the entire Chandaḥ.
3.369.6	For all these metres are employed in the twelve-day sacrifice.
3.369.7	All these metres are employed at the twelve-day (sacrifice).
3.369.8	Therefore, if one desires to offer to these metres, one should desire to offer to the Rtuks.
3.369.9	When one performs the sacrifice, one performs these metres.
3.369.10	When one performs these (sacrifices), one performs the Chhandas.
3.369.11	He who knows this has no distress at all.
3.369.12	He who accuses him suffers distress.
3.370.1	They say, "In which Stoma, in which Chhandas, in which deity is the Dvādaśāha finally established?"
3.370.2	He should say, "In the Trivrt stoma, in the Gayatri metre, in Agni as the deity, the Dvādaśāha is the ultimate foundation."
3.370.3	For they indeed proceed with the Trivrt Stoma, the Gayatri metre and Agni as the deity.
3.370.4	They indeed rise with them.
3.370.5	They say, "Which Stoma is one, which metre is one, which deity is one, and which Dvādaśaha carries?"
3.370.6	He should say, "The Trivṛt is the Stoma, the Gāyatrī is the metre, the one is the deity, and the twelve-day (rite) carries (them)."
3.370.7	For all the Stomas are indeed born from the Trivṛt, and all the metres from the Gāyatrīs.
3.370.8	The one is the deity and the twelve-days carry (them).
3.370.9	They say, "What is the Stoma? What is the metre? What is the deity? What is the twelve-day?"
3.370.10	He should say, "The Ekavimsa stoma, the Viraj metre, the sun as the deity, and the Dvadaśāha."
3.370.11	For the sun is indeed the Ekavimsa, the Viraj, and the deity of the Dvadaśaha.
3.370.12	They say, "The Dvadaśāhasama is the entire Sama."
3.370.13	What is the pause in the Sama, what is the foot, and what is the syllable?"
3.370.14	He should say, "The sun is the obstruction to the Saman, the atmosphere is the place, and speech is the syllable."
3.370.15	They say, "What is the obstruction to obstruction? What is the place to place? What is the syllable to syllable?"
3.370.16	He should say, "Vision is the obstruction to obstuction, mind is the place to the place, and breath is the syllable to the syllable."
3.371.1	They say, how is it that the Stomas become one Stoma? How are the metres one metre? How are the days one day? How are the forms one form? How are the Prsthas one Yajus? How are the Samavedas one Sama? How are the Vedas one Veda? How is this all, having become one, established in what?
3.371.2	He would say, "Stoma." Stomas become one. "Chanda" (metre). Chandas become one. "Ahara" (day). Ahara becomes one. "Rupa" (form). Rupas become one. "Prstha" (back). Prsthas become one. "Devata" (deity). Devatas become one. "Rg" (verse). Rg becomes one. "Yajus" (injunction). Yajuses become one. "Sama" (chant). Samas become one. "Veda" (Veda). Vedas become one. "Mind" (mind). All this, having become one, is established in the Prāṇa."
3.371.3	They say that this entire universe, having become one, is established in the mind. In what is the mind established?
3.372.1	One should say, "In the Purusha."
3.372.2	For the Purusha is indeed where the mind is established.
3.372.3	He who knows this, he indeed knows that the mind is established in the Purusha.
3.372.4	Therefore, one who knows this should be a teacher, for one does not destroy this entire universe.
3.372.5	Then indeed one should know, 'I am this all, in me this all is established.'
3.372.6	His world does not deteriorate.
3.372.7	They say, 'He who knows the twelve-day sacrifice should think, "He who knows me established in all directions knows me."
3.372.8	There are ten directions.
3.372.9	The days of the twelve-day (sacrifice) are ten.
3.372.10	These two worlds are the Prāyaniya and Udayaniya. This world is the Prāyaniy and that world is the Udayaniya.
3.372.11	This is the first day, this is the second, this is the third, this is the fourth, this is the fifth, this is the sixth, this is the seventh day, this is eighth, this is ninth, this is tenth.
3.372.12	This twelve-day sacrifice stands firm in all directions and becomes of the same world as all the gods.
3.372.13	The gods do not know that of him, for he does not approach them.
3.372.14	He alone among the gods knows this.
3.372.15	Prajapati is the twelve-day (rite).
3.372.16	Its worlds are indeed the directions.
3.372.17	This twelve-day (ritual) is established in all the worlds.
3.372.18	He who knows this twelve-day (rites) established in all the world attains establishment in all the worlds.
3.372.19	This indeed is the twelve-day sacrifice, which shines here. This is Indra, this is Prajapati, this indeed is all this.
3.372.20	This is the Brahman that is created and shines.
3.373.1	The Kṣatriya, the kingdom, the law, and truth are on this side. The penance, the lustre, the nourishment, and the nectar are on the other side.
3.373.2-9	Whatever here is the kingdom, Indra, Varuna, Soma, or the king, that is it. Whatever is the country, the divine classes, the Maruts, that is it Truth is the night. That is the truth, the day. Penance is lightning. That is it, whatever is the lightning, the thunderbolt that falls, that is it.
3.373.10	This is his verse:
3.373.11	The kingdom, the truth, the eternal, the Brahman, the hidden, the lower ones.
3.373.12	The austerity, the brilliance, the nectar of one's own abode, they dwell in the upper ones. In the middle, the Brahman shines.
3.373.13	Thus it is said.
3.373.14	This is indeed the Brahman shining in the middle.
3.373.15	Those who know this dwell in the upper world.
3.373.16	Just as a Kshatriya is protected, so is this Brahman protected for the sake of non-destruction.
3.374.1	When the gods sacrificed, Brihaspati himself chanted.
3.374.2	Gau and Ayasya were the Prastotar and Pratihartar.
3.374.3	Prajapati himself was the householder.
3.374.4	Indra himself was the Brahman.
3.374.5	He heard it from the Brahmana.
3.374.6	Mitra and Varuna were the Maitravaruna priests.
3.374.7	Agni was the Hotri priest.
3.374.8	He made Agni the Adhvaryu priest, the Ashvins the Udgathri priest, the Maruts the Nestr and Potri priests, the All-gods the Acchhavasaka priest, and Arbuda the Gravastut priest.
3.374.9	Vishnu praised the sacrifice.
3.374.10	Soma is the Udgātṛ, and Brahmā himself calls out to Subrahmaṇyā.
3.374.11	This twelve-day sacrifice is indeed the sacrifice of all the deities.
3.374.12	The twelve-day sacrifice proceeds with all these deities.
3.374.13	All these deities are performed in the twelve-day sacrifice.
3.374.14	Therefore, if one wishes to offer oblations to these deities, one should offer oblations to the Atharvas.
3.374.15	When one performs a sacrifice, one becomes those deities. When one performs a sacrifice for someone, one becomes those same deities.
3.374.16	For him who knows this, there is no affliction at all.
3.374.17	Whoever criticizes him will suffer affliction.
3.375.1	They say, "Why are the other sacrifices named after the nights, but the twelve-day sacrifice is named after the days?"
3.375.2	He should say, "The All-gods approached the father Prajapati and said, 'How big are you?'"
3.375.3	He said, 'I am twelve days.'"
3.375.4	What he said, "I am the twelve-day" is the twelve-day-ness of the twelve-day.
3.375.5	Indeed, this very year was Prajapati.
3.375.6	He said to these very twelve months, "I am twelve-day."
3.375.7	They say, "What is the door, what are the ten, what is the day?"
3.375.8	He should say, "The door is indeed the sun, the ten is the sun, the day is the sun."
3.375.9	Now, why is it that the sun is the gate? Because this is indeed the gate to the heavenly world.
3.375.10	And why is it that there are ten suns? Because this indeed shines in the ten directions.
3.375.11	And why does the sun shine? Because this indeed is the day.
3.375.12	They say, "One should perform the consecration with a twelve-day ritual."
3.375.13	One should say, "No."
3.376.1	He who performs the twelve-day sacrifice obtains the Stotras, the metres, the gods, the worlds, and the desires.
3.376.2	He becomes a non-knower of these.
3.376.3	And those who know and those who do not know, they think of him as doing what is done.
3.376.4	Therefore, one should not perform the twelve-day sacrifice. But they say that one should perform it.
3.376.5	The twelve-day sacrifice is indeed Prajapati, the Udgata is Prajapati, and the sacrificer is Prajapati.
3.376.6	The Udgata and the sacrificer have the same deity.
3.376.7	They attain the same prosperity, conquer the same world, and stand in the same deity.
3.376.8	Now, the sacrifice is the sacrificer, the Brahman-chanter.
3.376.9	By establishing himself in the sacrifice, he conquers the world of Brahman.
3.376.10	He becomes one who has attained the world of the sacrificer.
3.376.11	They say, "When this deity became everything, which deity was it?"
3.377.1	One should say, "The breath."
3.377.2	Breath indeed became everything.
3.377.3	What is the door? This is the door, for everything depends on it.
3.377.4	What is the giver? This gives everything.
3.377.5	What is peace? This touches everything with peace.
3.377.6	What is taking? This takes everything.
3.377.7	He who knows this, whether he does good or not, then his good is done.
3.377.8	He should know, 'I do good, not bad.'
3.377.9	'The world of those who do good is my world.'
3.377.10	His world is indeed that.
3.377.11	The world of all others decays.
3.377.12	The world does not decay for one who knows thus.
3.377.13	This is the deity that creates.
3.377.14	This deity indeed gives life to all this.
3.377.15	And because it gives life, it is Prāṇa.
3.377.16	When one who knows this departs from this world, this deity indeed carries him away and flies up.
3.377.17	It takes him to that world where there is nothing beyond.
3.377.18	They say, "One should perform the twelve-day sacrifice. One should perform the twelve days. One who knows this established in the sun." The twelve-day sacrifice is indeed the sun. Its Prāyaniya and Udayaniya are indeed the day and night.
3.377.19	The Prāyaniya is indeed the day, the Udayaniya is indeed the night.
3.377.20	Its rays going east are the first day.
3.378.1	The ones going to the south are the second, the ones going to the west are the third, the ones going north are the fourth, the ones going upwards are the fifth, the ones going downwards are the sixth, the ones shining are the seventh, the ones burning are the eighth, the ones like copper are the ninth, and the circle is the tenth day.
3.378.2	This twelve-day (rite) is established in the sun.
3.378.3	He who knows this twelve-day (ritual) established in the sun, indeed, stands in the sun, attains the entire span of life, and goes to heaven, having destroyed sin, he who knows this.
3.378.4	Thus it is in the deity.
3.378.5	Now, in the self.
3.378.6	This very twelve-day (period) is the person in the eye.
3.379.2	The person is the same as the person of the previous day, and the breaths are the subsequent days.
3.379.3	Breath is the seventh day, sight is the eighth, hearing is the ninth, and speech is the tenth day.
3.379.4	When he says 'two', two persons are seen.
3.379.5	When he say 'giver', this one gives everything here.
3.379.6	Now, as to why it is called 'Sha', for it touches all this here.
3.379.7	Now, as to why (it is called) 'Da', for it gives all this here. 
3.379.8	Now, as it is called 'Sa', for it touches everything here.
3.379.9	Now as to why it's called 'Da', for he takes everything here.
3.379.10	This is indeed the Ukthya.
3.379.11	For it raises all this here as it were.
3.379.12	Therefore this is indeed the Uktha.
3.379.13	This is indeed the Uktha.
3.379.14	For this indeed touches all this with peace.
3.379.15	And because it says 'Ha' (i.e. 'Take'), this indeed takes all this.
3.379.16	This is indeed the Ukthya.
3.379.17	For this raises all this as it were.
3.379.18	Therefore this is indeed the Uktham.
3.379.19	This is the Rk.
3.379.20	This is called Urgha.
3.379.21	They call it Rk indirectly.
3.379.22	Therefore, this is the Uktha.
3.379.23	This is indeed the Yajus.
3.379.24	For this indeed consumes everything here.
3.379.25	Therefore, this is the Yajus
3.379.26	This is indeed Sama.
3.379.27	For this is indeed everything here.
3.379.28	This is the Sama.
3.379.29	This is Udgitha.
3.379.30	For this, indeed, is everything here.
3.379.31	Now, as to why it is called 'Giti' (song), it is because it sings everything here.
3.379.32	And as to why it says 'Th', it is because it is his food.
3.379.33	Therefore, this is indeed the Udgitha.
3.379.34	This is indeed Brahman.
3.379.35	For it makes everything here old, as it were.
3.379.36	Therefore, it is indeed the Yajus.
3.379.37	This is the Sama.
3.379.38	For it brings everything here together.
3.379.39	Therefore, he is indeed the Sama.
3.379.40	This is indeed the Udgītha.
3.379.41	In that it is Udgītha, this entire world is indeed uplifted by it.
3.379.42	And in that it is Gītha, this whole world indeed sings by it.
3.379.43	Then in that it is Tha, this is indeed its food.
3.379.44	Therefore, this is indeed the Udagītha.
3.379.45	This is indeed Brahman.
3.379.46	For this indeed sustains this entire world.
3.379.47	Therefore, it is indeed Brahman.
3.379.48	This is the name of the Brahman.
3.379.49	They call it Brahman indirectly.
3.379.50	This deity sustains him in this world and the other world, he who knows this.
3.379.51	He who knows this twelve-day sacrifice as established in the deity, the sun, the supreme person, and in the self, stands in the sun. All the Vedas, all the gods, all the worlds, and all desires are milked for him.
3.379.52	Having transcended the gods, he attains the world of Brahma.
3.379.53	This is the Uktha, this is the Rk, this is the Yajus, this is the Sama, this is the Udgitha, this is Brahman, this is all. Thus one should meditate.
3.380.1	This alone was the atmosphere in the beginning.
3.380.2	It is the same even now.
3.380.3	This is the covering that pervades these worlds.
3.380.4	Therefore it is called 'Dvi-nama' (having two names).
3.380.5-12	It desired, 'May I be born, may I go to the earth.' It performed austerities. While performing austerities, it shone. It shone today. It became lightning. This is the fire, this is the light. Having become lightning, it performed austerities. Then thunder was born.
3.380.13	Therefore, when it thunders, then it rains.
3.380.14	Having become a thundering cloud, he heated.
3.380.15	Then rain was born.
3.380.16	Therefore, when it thonders, then it rains
3.380.17	This was the great water of the waters.
3.380.18	What they say here, that this was the great water, the waters of the waters.
3.380.19	Then, having become water, he heated.
3.380.20	Then food was born.
3.380.21	Having become food, he heated. 
3.380.22	Then the food-made person was born, the creator of beings.
3.380.23	He uttered in those waters "bhūr bhuvah svar."
3.380.24	Those very worlds came into being.
3.380.25	The directions were created from that.
3.380.26	Then when he uttered the words "the born, the growing, the increasing," these very worlds came into being.
3.380.27	The seasons were created in accordance with that.
3.380.28	He said, "These are my true existence."
3.380.29	Those very months came into being. 
3.380.30	The seasons were then created in accordance with it.
3.380.31	He said "These are my real existence."
3.380.32	Those same months came into being.
3.380.33	The fortnights are called Rddhi.
3.380.34	The days are called 'I am' and the nights are called 'I have been'.
3.380.35	The nights are called 'Osa' and the dawns are called 'Osha'.
3.380.36	The speech that he uttered while being born, that became the god Trida.
3.380.37	Whatever deity he was when he was born, that he became.
3.380.38	He thought, "I have created this Triveda. Let me create from it."
3.381.1	He cried out to the Gayatri with the Trivrit Stoma.
3.381.2	Then he created the Vasus with Agni as their leader.
3.381.3	He cried out with the Pancadasha Stoma to the Tristubh.
3.381.4	Then he created the Rudras, with Indra as their leader.
3.381.5	With the seventeen-fold Stoma, he chanted the Jagati.
3.381.6	Then he created the Adityas, with Varuna as their leader. 
3.381.7	With the twenty-one-fold Stoma he chanted the Anushtubh.
3.381.8	Then he produced the Vishvas, with Vishnu as their leader.  
3.381.9	With the twenty three-fold Stoma and the Paṅkti metre, he chanted.
3.381.10	Then the Maruts were created, with Indra as their leader.
3.381.11	He roared with the Trayastrimsa Stoma, the Atichandas.
3.381.12	Then he created the Sadhyas and Aptyas, with Savitar as their leader. 
3.381.13	He roared with Pañcavimsa Stoma, the Brihatī.
3.381.14	Then he produced the Gandharvas, with Mitra as their leader.  
3.381.15	He roared with Viraj.
3.381.16	Then he created the Apsarases from the mouth of Tvashtri.
3.381.17	He roared at Kakubha.
3.381.18	Then he created serpents from the mouth of Angiras.
3.381.19	He roared to Ushniha.
3.381.20	Then Angiras created Atharva-faced ones.
3.381.21	He roared the line of letters.
3.381.22	Then he produced the Asuras from the mouth of Asita.
3.381.23	He roared for the Viṣṭāra-Paṅkṛṃ.
3.381.24	Then he created the Pitṛs, with Yama as their leader.
3.381.25	He roared for the bipeds.
3.381.26	Then he creted humans, with Death as their leader. 
3.381.27	He roared for those with one foot.
3.381.28	Then he crated the birds, with Death as the leader.
3.381.29	He roard for the limitless desires.
3.381.30	Then he created the animals, with Dhātri as their leader.
3.381.31	Having created all this, he ascended upwards.
3.381.32	He went to that place where they perceive him above.
3.382.1	In this eastern direction, the Vasus sought him, with Agni as their leader. They found him.
3.382.2	The form of the fire-rays is that.
3.382.3	They worship that very form of him.
3.382.4-9	They sought him in this southern direction, with Indra as their leader. They found it in the form of the sun. They worship him in that form. They sought him in this western direction, with Varuna as their leader. They found it in the moon's form. They worship it in that form.
3.382.10	The All-gods in the north direction sought him, with Vishnu as their leader.
3.382.11	They found him in the form of lightning.
3.382.12	That is what they worship.
3.382.13	The Maruts in the upward direction sought him, led by Ishana.
3.382.14	They found his form in the form of the sun.
3.382.15	That is all that they worship.
3.382.16-21	The Sadhyas and Aptyas sought him in this world, with Savitar at their head. They found him, the dark form. That is what they worship of him. The Gandharvas sought him in this very place, with Mitra at their head. They found him, the form of honey. That is his form which they worship.
3.382.22	The Angirasas sought him, those with mouths of Atharva.
3.382.23	They found what was the form of ghee, that.
3.382.24	That alone they worship him with.
3.382.25	The Asuras sought him, those having mouths of Asita.
3.382.26	They found out what was the form for Sura, that.
3.382.27	They worship him with that alone.
3.383.1	Therefore they were defeated.
3.383.2-7	For they worship him in his most sinful form. His fathers in the world of the fathers sought him with Yama as their leader. They found him in the form of milk-rice. They worship him in that form. This was indeed the first form of food, namely, milk-rice. Now this is its altered form, which men worship.
3.383.8	They sought him in the form of birds, but he was at the mouth of death.
3.383.9	They found him in the form (of a bird) with golden wings.
3.383.10	That is what they worship.
3.383.11	The cattle sought him at the mouth of the creator.
3.383.12	They found (him) with golden horns, golden tail, and black bull.
3.383.13	That is the same as this, they worship it.
3.383.14	This is indeed the form of that deity, the Satyayajna. The golden-horned, golden-hoofed, black bull.
3.383.15	He who knows this becomes the bull of his own people.
3.383.16	And also he who shines here.
3.384.1	He sought this in the upward direction.
3.384.2	He found him seated with all these forms.
3.384.3	He gave all these forms to him.
3.384.4	Whatever good form is born here, he gives it, and it is born here.
3.384.5	When he uttered "bhūr bhuvaḥ svar," these three worlds became the world of truth, the world of water, and the invincible world.
3.384.6	Then when he uttered the words "the born, the growing, the increasing", these very ones became the other worlds, above the heaven, below the heaven, in the light, in the firmament, and the seventh world of Brahma, in which this truth shines.
3.384.7	This deity, having become truth, entered it.
3.384.8	That truth is indeed the breath, and the offspring are true.
3.384.9	By this truth, may all this be gathered together.
3.384.10	If he speaks the truth, then his truth is indeed spoken.
3.384.11	If he knows, 'I speak the truth, not falsehood,' then the world of him who speaks the truth is his world.
3.384.12	For him, that alone is his world.
3.384.13	"This is Brahman, this is Brahman," thus indeed do we discuss. In the same way, this deity discusses this. No one knows that.
3.384.14	"The deity has entered the month." He who knows that, he alone knows that.
3.384.15	This deity has entered this.
3.384.16	He who knows thus, nothing is unknown to him. No deity.
3.385.1	This is his verse:
3.385.2	Beyond this, beyond that, beyond the third, or even the fourth,
3.385.3	In the thousand-pillared, measured, firm, fierce abode where the god of gods dwells.
3.385.4	This indeed is the god of gods who shines.
3.385.5	This is his thousand-pillared, measured, firm, and strong (residence), which is the year, the seasons, the months, the half-months, the days and nights, and the twilights.
3.385.6	He who knows this entire twelve-day (sacrifice) as approaching himself, all his desires approach him.
3.385.7	All the Stotras, all the Prsthas, all the metres, all the Savanas, all the animals, all the gods, all the worlds, all the desires are connected with the twelve-day (rite), are satisfied with the twelve-days, are satisfied with the twelvedays, are accomplished in the twelve-days and are established in the twelve-day.
3.385.8	They say, "Why is it called the twelve-day sacrifice, when it is only ten days?"
3.385.9	He should reply, "It is because these twelve Agniṣṭoma sacrifices are completed.
3.386.1	They say that the year consists of thirteen months, and the year is the fourteenth. By what means do they attain the thirteenth month and the fourteenth year?
3.386.2	One should say by means of the Atiratra sacrifices.
3.386.3	They attain the thirteenth month by the Prāyaniya Atiratra and the fourteenth year by the Udayaniya.
3.386.4	They say, "He who knows the twelve-day sacrifice knows it well, he thinks, 'He who knows it as established in all worlds.'
3.386.5	The days of the twelve-day are the months, and those very are the worlds, and these are the worlds of the gods.
3.386.6	The month of Phālguna is the first day of the twelve-day period.

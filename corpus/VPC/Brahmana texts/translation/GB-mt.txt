1.1.1.1	Oṃ. Indeed, this Brahman was the first, self-existent, and one alone.
1.1.1.2	Then it desired:
1.1.1.3	"Indeed, the Yakṣa is great, since I am alone."
1.1.1.4	"Let me create a second god, equal to myself."
1.1.1.5	It exerted itself, heated itself, and heated itself intensely.
1.1.1.6	From the forehead of that one who was tired, heated, and intensely heated, moisture arose, which was moist.
1.1.1.7	Therefore he rejoiced.
1.1.1.8	He said this:
1.1.1.9	"I have found the great Yaksha, the well-known one."
1.1.1.10	Because he said this:
1.1.1.11	“I have found the Great Yaksha, the Well-known One.”
1.1.1.12	Therefore he became Suveda.
1.1.1.13	They call him Suveda, the existent one, indirectly, by the name Sweta.
1.1.1.14	The gods are indeed like those who love in secret, but hate those who are seen.
1.1.2.1	He exerted himself more, he tormented himself more, he heated himself more.
1.1.2.2	When he was tired, heated, and heated up, from all the pores of his skin, separate streams of sweat flowed.
1.1.2.3	He rejoiced with them.
1.1.2.4	He said this:
1.1.2.5	"With these (powers) I shall hold all this that is here."
1.1.2.6	"With these (powers), I shall generate all this that is."
1.1.2.7	"With this, I shall attain all this that is."
1.1.2.8	What he said was:
1.1.2.9	"With these, I shall hold all that is here."
1.1.2.10	Therefore, they became the streams.
1.1.2.11	That is the nature of the streams, and what is born in them.
1.1.2.12	That is what he said.
1.1.2.13	"With these, I shall generate all this that exists, whatever it is."
1.1.2.14	Therefore, they became wives.
1.1.2.15	That is why they are called wives, because a man is born in them and a son is born.
1.1.2.16	The name of the son is "Puna" because he saves from hell.
1.1.2.17	Therefore, he is called "putra" because he saves.
1.1.2.18	That is the sonhood of the son.
1.1.2.19	That is what he said.
1.1.2.20	"By these, I will attain everything that exists, whatever it is."
1.1.2.21	Therefore, water came into existence.
1.1.2.22	That is why water is called "apa."
1.1.2.23	He attains all the desires he wishes for.
1.1.3.1-6	Having created those waters, he looked at them. In them he saw his own shadow. When he saw that, his own semen fell down. It stood in the waters. They became exhausted, heated and intensely heated there itself, and along with the semen, they became divided into two.
1.1.3.7	Among them, one was very salty, unfit to drink, and tasteless.
1.1.3.8	They, being restless, went to the ocean and stood there.
1.1.3.9	The other ones were fit to drink, tasty, and peaceful.
1.1.3.10	They became exhausted, heated, and intensely heated there itself.
1.1.3.11	From those exhausted, heated, intensely heated ones, the semen that was there became shed.
1.1.3.12	Therefore, Bhṛgu came into existence.
1.1.3.13	That is the Bhṛgu-ness of Bhṛgu.
1.1.3.14	He who knows this shines like Bhṛgu in all worlds.
1.1.4.1	Having created Bhṛgu, he disappeared.
1.1.4.2	That Bhṛgu, created, went east.
1.1.4.3	Speech addressed him.
1.1.4.4	"Wind! Wind!"
1.1.4.5	He turned back and went to the southern direction.
1.1.4.6	Speech addressed him.
1.1.4.7	"He said, "O Matarisvan, O Matarisvan!"
1.1.4.8	He turned back and went to the western direction.
1.1.4.9	Speech addressed him.
1.1.4.10	He said, "O Pavaman, O Pavaman!"
1.1.4.11	He turned back, and went to the northern direction.
1.1.4.12	Speech spoke to him.
1.1.4.13	He spoke, "O Vata, O Vata!"
1.1.4.14	He said to him,
1.1.4.15	"But I do not know him."
1.1.4.16	"No," he said.
1.1.4.17	"Then search for him in these very waters."
1.1.4.18	"What he said, 'Then search for him here in these very waters,' that is why he is called Atharva."
1.1.4.19	That is why Atharva is called Atharvan.
1.1.4.20	Now, indeed, of this revered sage Atharva, just as the hair, the limbs, and the breath are of Brahma, so also his entire self became.
1.1.4.21	Brahma said to Atharva, "Having created the offspring of Prajapati, protect them."
1.1.4.22	When he said, "Having created the creatures of Prajapati, protect them," he became Prajapati.
1.1.4.23	That is the lordship of Prajapati. Prajapati himself is the lord.
1.1.4.24	Prajapati himself is Atharva.
1.1.4.25	He who knows this shines like Prajapati in all worlds.
1.1.5.1	He approached the sage Atharva, and practiced austerities, heated himself, and heated intensely.
1.1.5.2	Therefore, from the tired, heated, and heated one, he created the sages of Atharva Veda, who were single-versed, two-versed, three-versed, four-versed, five-versed, six-versed, seven-versed, eight-versed, nine-versed, and ten-versed.
1.1.5.3	He exerted, heated, and intensely heated those sages of Atharvaveda.
1.1.5.4	From them, the exhausted, heated, and heated up, the Atharvanas, the Arshas, the Ekadasas, the Dvadasas, the Trayodasas, the Catu- rdasas, the Pancadasas, the Sodasas, the Saptadasas, the As- tadasas, the Navadasas, and the Vimsas emerged.
1.1.5.5	He exerted himself, heated himself, and heated himself intensely for the Atharvaṇa sages and the Atharvaṇas.
1.1.5.6	From those who were exhausted, heated, and intensely heated, he saw the mantras, which became the Atharva Veda.
1.1.5.7	He exerted himself, heated, and heated himself for the Atharvan Veda.
1.1.5.8	Therefore, from the tired, from the heated, from the heated one, the syllable 'Om' emerged upwards.
1.1.5.9	He who wishes to perform all these rites with Atharva and Atharvana mantras should perform them with this great Vyahrti.
1.1.5.10	He who knows this and he who, knowing this, performs this great invocation with these Atharva and Atharvaṇa mantras, has his work done by all of them.
1.1.6.1	He exerted himself more, he tormented himself more, he heated himself more.
1.1.6.2	He created the three worlds from himself, namely, the earth, the sky and heaven.
1.1.6.3	He created the earth with his feet,
1.1.6.4	the sky with his belly and heaven with his head.
1.1.6.5	He tormented, heated and scorched those three worlds.
1.1.6.6	From them, when they were tired, heated, and heated up, he created three gods.
1.1.6.7	Agni, Vayu, and Aditya.
1.1.6.8	He created Agni from the earth, Vayu from the atmosphere, and Aditya from the sky.
1.1.6.9	He exerted, heated, and intensely heated those three gods.
1.1.6.10	For them, who were tired, heated, and heated up, he created the three Vedas: the Rig Veda, the Yajur Veda, and the Sama Veda.
1.1.6.11	The Rig Veda from Agni, the Yajur from Vayu, and the Sama from Aditya.
1.1.6.12	He exerted himself, heated himself, and heated up those three Vedas.
1.1.6.13	For those who were tired, heated, and heated up, he created the three great invocations: "Bhūr, Bhuvah, and Svar."
1.1.6.14	"Bhūr" from the Rig Veda, "Bhuvah" from the Yajur Veda, and "Svar" from the Sama Veda.
1.1.6.15	He who wishes to perform all these three Vedas, should perform them with these great formulas.
1.1.6.16	He who knows this and he who, knowing this, performs these great formulas, performs all these three Vedas.
1.1.7.1	Those who, having surrounded the semen, stood there, they rushed together from the east, south, west and north.
1.1.7.2	Because they rushed together, it is called the ocean.
1.1.7.3	Those who were frightened said:
1.1.7.4	"We choose the king as our lord."
1.1.7.5	Because they chose and stood, it became Varana.
1.1.7.6	Now, they call him who is Varana, Varuna, indirectly.
1.1.7.7	For the gods are fond of the indirect and hate the direct.
1.1.7.8	He was freed from the ocean.
1.1.7.9	He became free.
1.1.7.10	Now, they call him, who is Mucyu, Death, indirectly.
1.1.7.11	Gods, indeed, are like those who love in secret, but hate those who are seen.
1.1.7.12	He, Varuna, the Death, exerted himself, heated himself, and heated himself intensely.
1.1.7.13	From all his limbs, when he was wearied, heated, and intensely heated, the juice oozed out.
1.1.7.14	That became the juice of the limbs.
1.1.7.15	Him, indeed, who is present as the juice of the body, they call Angiras by a secret name.
1.1.7.16	For the gods are like those who love from afar, but hate those who are near.
1.1.8.1	He tormented, heated, and intensely heated the sage Angiras.
1.1.8.2	From him, tormented, heated, intensely heated, he created the twenty Angiras sages.
1.1.8.3	He tormented and heated and intensely heated those twenty Angirasa sages.
1.1.8.4	For those who were tired, heated, and heated up, he created the Angirasas, the descendants of Angiras, in ten groups: the sixteen-versed, the eighteen-versed, the twelve-versed, the one-versed, the two-versed, the three-versed, the four-versed, the five-versed, the six-versed, and the seven-versed.
1.1.8.5	He exerted, heated, and intensely heated the Angirasa sages and the Angirasa students.
1.1.8.6	From those who were exhausted, heated, and intensively heated, he saw the mantras. That became the Angirasa Veda.
1.1.8.7	He exerted, heated, intensely heated that Angirasa Veda.
1.1.8.8	Therefore, from the tired, the heated, the heated one, the people were born. Thus the dual syllable "janat" came into being.
1.1.8.9	He who wishes to perform all these rites with the Angiras and the Angirasas should perform them with this great Vyahrti.
1.1.8.10	He who knows this and he who knowing this performs this great invocation with these Angiras and Angirasas, all of them are accomplished for him.
1.1.9.1	He stood above.
1.1.9.2	He steadied these worlds.
1.1.9.3	Therefore the Angirasas, the most learned, stand above.
1.1.9.4	He should meditate on that vow in his mind, whatever he may meditate on in his mind, it will happen accordingly.
1.1.9.5	It happens accordingly.
1.1.9.6	This is also said in the Rig Veda:
1.1.9.7	The best knowledge was born from austerities, it came into existence for the sake of the Brahmins.
1.1.9.8	The truth that is being created, this creation, the abode, is free from debt, far away from it.
1.1.9.9	Those are the daughters-in-law of the Angirasas, who are the Meņas.
1.1.9.10	He who knows this makes his own the power of the Meņas. He who knows this makes
1.1.10.1	He looked at the directions: the eastern, the southern, the western, the northern, the firm, the upward.
1.1.10.2	They exerted themselves, they heated themselves, they heated up there.
1.1.10.3	From them, the tired, heated, and heated up ones, he created the five Vedas:
1.1.10.4	The Serpent Veda, the Demon Veda, the Asura Veda, the History Veda, and the Purana Veda.
1.1.10.5	He created the Serpent Veda in the eastern direction.
1.1.10.6	The Veda of the Pisācas is in the south.
1.1.10.7	The Veda of the Asuras is in the west.
1.1.10.8	The Itihasa Veda is in the north.
1.1.10.9	The Purana Veda is in the zenith and above.
1.1.10.10	He exerted, heated, and intensely heated those five Vedas.
1.1.10.11	From those who were exhausted, heated, and intensively heated, he created the five great invocations.
1.1.10.12	The Veda of the Serpents, the Veda of the Pisācas, the Veda of Asuras, the Veda of History, and the Veda of the Purāṇas.
1.1.10.13	The Veda of the Serpnets is the Veda of Growth.
1.1.10.14	The Veda pf the Pisācas is the Veda of the Hand.
1.1.10.15	The Veda af Asuras is the Veda of Increase.
1.1.10.16	The Veda ef History is the Veda of Greatness.
1.1.10.17	The Veda cf the Purāṇās is the Veda of That.
1.1.10.18	He who wishes to perform all these five Vedas, should perform them with these great formulas.
1.1.10.19	He who knows this and he who, knowing this, performs these great formulas, performs all these five Vedas.
1.1.11.1	He looked at the past and the future.
1.1.11.2	They exerted, heated, and intensely heated themselves there.
1.1.11.3	From them, when they were exhausted, heated, and heated intensely, the syllable "peace" emerged upward.
1.1.11.4	Now he who would perform all these rites, both those that are to be performed and those that are not to be performed, should perform them with this great formula.
1.1.11.5	He for whom all these rites, those that are to performed and those that should not be performed, are performed, he who knows this and performs them with this great rite.
1.1.12.1	He again exerted himself, again he tormented himself, again he heated himself.
1.1.12.2	He created the moon from his mind.
1.1.12.3	The stars from his nails.
1.1.12.4	The herbs and trees from his hair.
1.1.12.5	Many other gods from the small breaths.
1.1.12.6-10	He exerted himself more, he tormented himself more, he heated himself more. He saw this sacrifice of three layers, seven threads, and twenty-one parts. This is also said in a verse: "Agni saw the sacrifice of three layers and seven threads." And this verse also describes it: "Agne, the sacrifice of three parts and seven threads."
1.1.12.11	There are seven Sutyas and seven Pakayajnas.
1.1.13.1	He brought it.
1.1.13.2	He performed the sacrifice with it.
1.1.13.3	Agni was the Hotri priest of that sacrifice.
1.1.13.4	Vayu was the Adhvaryu priest.
1.1.13.5	Surya was the Udgata priest.
1.1.13.6	Candrama was the Brahma priest.
1.1.13.7	Parjanya was the Sadasy priest.
1.1.13.8	Oshadhis and Vanaspati were the Camasa-Adhvaryus.
1.1.13.9	The Visvedevas were the Hotrakas.
1.1.13.10	Atharva-Angirasas were the Goptaras.
1.1.13.11	Now those who knew this, the ancient scholars, used to approach the sacrifice with the words, "We have come."
1.1.13.12	"May this heat not destroy our immortal progeny when we are careless."
1.1.13.13	They are called the protectors of the sacrifice, the ones who spread the assembly, the ones who accomplish the Dakṣiṇā.
1.1.13.14	Prajapati said this:
1.1.13.15	If the priests at a sacrifice are not skilled, do not observe celibacy, or transgress the rules,
1.1.13.16	then they say that it is a defect in the sacrifice.
1.1.13.17	The sacrificer is affected by the defect in the sacrifice,
1.1.13.18	the priests are affected by the defect of the sacrificer,
1.1.13.19	the sacrificial gifts are affected by the defects of the priests,
1.1.13.20-22	The sacrificer is deprived of the Dakṣiṇās. The sacrificer is deprived (of the Dakṣiṇa) in accordance with the deprivation of the sons and cattle. The sacrificers are deprived (of the Daksina) in accordance with deprivation of the sons, cattle and heaven. The heaven is deprived (of Daksina) according to the deprivation of the half of the heaven in which they perform the sacrifice. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.1.14.1	They used to run to him, knowing him thus, saying, "Brahman, you are the cause of the Yajna's prosperity or you are the cause for the Yajna not to prosper."
1.1.14.2	"Salutations to you, O Blessed One!
1.1.14.3	Please make the Yajna prosper for us."
1.1.14.4	If there is any damage, then having placed the fires in the proper place and performed the Śānti-water rite, he sprinkles the fires three times with the formula, "To Pṛthivī, to Śrotra..." and sprinkles around three times.
1.1.14.5	He makes the one who is performing the rite rinse his mouth three times and sprinkles him.
1.1.14.6	He sprinkles the place of the sacrifice.
1.1.14.7	If the sacrifice is damaged by the juice of the Vedas, it is repaired.
1.1.14.8	Just as gold is joined with salt, silver with gold, metal with silver, lead with metal, and tin with lead, so too is this sacrifice joined with what is defective.
1.1.14.9	The sacrificer is joined with the joining of the sacrifice.
1.1.14.10	The priests are joined with the joining by the sacrificer.
1.1.14.11	The sacrificial gifts are joined with the uniting of the priests.
1.1.14.12-14	The sacrificer is united with the Dakṣiṇās. The sacrificer is united through the union of sons and cattle. The sacrificers are united through the union with heaven. The union of heaven is united with the union of the half of the world in which they sacrifice. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.1.15.1	Now indeed the god Atharvan, knowing, said: "The rites of the sacrifice should be performed in a peaceful manner." At the sacrifice expiation is performed, and yet much that is contrary to the sacrifice is done. And yet he has no distress at all, and he does not come to the sacrifice's weakness. He overcomes death again and again, and goes beyond rebirth. His freedom of movement shines in all worlds for him who knows this, and for him who, knowing this, becomes Brahman, and for him for whom the Brahman who knows this sits to the right of the assembly hall, and for him whom the Brahman who, knowing this sits to the south, facing north, and offers oblations of ghee at the sacrifice.
1.1.16.1	Brahma created Brahma in the lotus.
1.1.16.2	That Brahma, created, thought:
1.1.16.3	By which one syllable, I may know all desires, all worlds, all gods, all Vedas, all sacrifices, all sounds, all luminaries, all beings, all immovable and moving, I may know them all."
1.1.16.4	He practiced celibacy.
1.1.16.5	He saw this syllable Oṃ, which is two-colored and four-beat, pervading everything, the Brahman of all, the Brahman of no delay, the Brahmanic Vyāhṛti, having Brahman as its deity.
1.1.16.6	She knew all desires, all worlds, all gods, all Vedas, all sacrifices, all words, all luminaries, all beings, both moving and unmoving.
1.1.16.7	With her first color, she knew water and oil.
1.1.16.8	With the second colour, he obtained the lustre and the stars.
1.1.17.1	With the first sound alone, he obtained the earth, fire, plants and trees, the Rig Veda, the Vyāhṛti 'Bhūr', the Gāyatrī metre, the Trivṛt stoma, the eastern direction, the spring season, speech, the tongue, taste, and the senses.
1.1.18.1	With the second of his sounds, he attained the sky, the wind, the Yajur Veda, the Vyāhṛti Bhuvaḥ, the Tristubh metre, the Stoma of fifteen, the western direction, the summer season, the Prāṇa as the inner, the nose and the smelling of smell as the senses.
1.1.19.1	With the third tone, he attained heaven, the sun, the Samaveda, the Vyahrti Svar, the Jagata metre, the Stoma of seventeen, the northern direction, the rainy season, the light, the eyes, and the sense of sight.
1.1.20.1	By the letter V, he obtained water, the moon, the Atharvaveda, the stars, and his own self, by the letter O. By the letter J, he obtained the Angirasas, the Anushtubh metre, the twenty-one-fold Stoma, the southern direction, the autumn season, the mind, the internal knowledge, and the knowable, and thus he obtained the senses.
1.1.21.1	He attained the Veda, the Itihasa, the Purana, the Vakavakya, the Gathas, the Narasamsis, the Upanisads, and the instructions. He attained the great, the growing, the increasing, the Om, the Vyahrtis, the Svaras, the Sama, the various strings, the Svaras (melodies), the dances, the songs, and the instruments. He attained the Citraratha as the deity, the lightning as the light, the Barhaspatya as the metre, the Trinava and Trayastrimsa as the Stomas, the Dhruva and the upward direction, the Hemanta and Sisira as the seasons, the hearing as the internal, and the hearing of sound as the sense organs.
1.1.22.1	This one-syllabled syllable, the most excellent of the austerities of Brahman, appeared at the beginning of the Atharva Veda of Brahman.
1.1.22.2	Therefore, mantras appeared.
1.1.22.3	Now, those mantras which are deficient, defective, and worn out due to not studying the Vedas with austerity and proper attention, he should replenish with the brilliance of the Atharva Veda.
1.1.22.4	And may the mantras face me, like a fetus longing for its mother.
1.1.22.5	He employs the syllable "Om" at the beginning.
1.1.22.6	With this very verse, one should revive it.
1.1.22.7	This very (verse) is yoked before the sacrifice.
1.1.22.8	This is at the end.
1.1.22.9	The sacrifice is supported on all sides by this (verse).
1.1.22.10	This is also said in this verse:
1.1.22.11	"She who is yoked before, in the imperishable supreme sky, by the verses."
1.1.22.12	Now this is the syllable. A brahmin, having fasted for three nights, facing east, controlling his speech, sitting on a sacrificial grass, should recite it a thousand times, whatever desire he may have.
1.1.22.13	His aims and all his deeds are accomplished. Thus says the Brahmana.
1.1.23.1	The city of Indra is the stream of Vasu.
1.1.23.2	The Asuras surrounded it.
1.1.23.3	The gods were frightened.
1.1.23.4	Who will slay these Asuras?
1.1.23.5	They saw Brahma's son, the eldest, Oṃkāra.
1.1.23.6	They said to him,
1.1.23.7	"With your mouth, we will conquer these Asuras."
1.1.23.8	He said,
1.1.23.9	"What will be my reward?"
1.1.23.10	"Choose a boon."
1.1.23.11	"I choose."
1.1.23.12	He chose the boon,
1.1.23.13	Brahmanas should not speak Brahma without addressing me.
1.1.23.14	If they speak, it would be non-Brahma.
1.1.23.15	They said, "So be it."
1.1.23.16	The gods, engaged with the Asuras in the northern part of the divine sacrifice,
1.1.23.17	overpowered the Asuras with the Om sound from the Agnidhra chamber.
1.1.23.18	Because they overpowered them, the Om sound is uttered first.
1.1.23.19	He who does not know this Om, becomes a slave. But he who knows it, becomes a master of Brahman.
1.1.23.20	Therefore, Om becomes the Rig in the Rigveda.
1.1.23.21	It becomes the Yajus in the Yajurveda.
1.1.23.22	It is the Sama in the Samaveda.
1.1.23.23	It forms the Sutra in the Sutra.
1.1.23.24	It is Brahman in the Brahmana.
1.1.23.25	It is a verse in the verse.
1.1.23.26	It is Pranava in the Pranava. This is the Brahmana.
1.1.24.1	We ask about Oṃkāra.
1.1.24.2	What is the element?
1.1.24.3	What is the root?
1.1.24.4	What is called the name?
1.1.24.5	What is gender?
1.1.24.6	What is number?
1.1.24.7	What is case?
1.1.24.8	What is affix?
1.1.24.9	What is svar, prefix, and interjection?
1.1.24.10	What is grammar?
1.1.24.11	What is modification?
1.1.24.12	What is modified?
1.1.24.13	How many measures?
1.1.24.14	How many letters?
1.1.24.15	How many syllables?
1.1.24.16	How many words?
1.1.24.17	What is the union?
1.1.24.18	What is the giving of the place? What do the students recite?
1.1.24.19	What is metre?
1.1.24.20	What is a letter? These are the earlier questions.
1.1.24.21	Then the later ones:
1.1.24.22	Mantras, Kalpas, Brahmanas, Rig, Yajus, and Sama.
1.1.24.23	Why do the Brahmavadins begin with Om?
1.1.24.24	What is deity?
1.1.24.25	What is astrology?
1.1.24.26	What is Nirukta?
1.1.24.27	What is the place?
1.1.24.28	What is the nature?
1.1.24.29	What is meant by 'inward'?
1.1.24.30	There are thirty-six questions.
1.1.24.31	The first three groups of twelve questions are in order.
1.1.24.32	We will explain the Oṃkāra with these.
1.1.25.1	Indra asked Prajapati,
1.1.25.2	"O Lord, I ask after praising you."
1.1.25.3	He said, "Ask, my son."
1.1.25.4	"What is this Oṃkāra?"
1.1.25.5	Whose son is he?
1.1.25.6	What is this metre?
1.1.25.7	What is the colour of this?
1.1.25.8	What is it that Brahma becomes Brahma?
1.1.25.9	Therefore, that good one first placed the Om.
1.1.25.10	The Oṃkāra in the Ṛgveda is a single syllable with svarita and udātta.
1.1.25.11	The Oṅkāra in the Yajurveda is a single-syllabled udātta with three qualities.
1.1.25.12	The Oṃkāra of the Sāma Veda is long, prolonged, and acute, consisting of one syllable.
1.1.25.13	The Oṃkāra in the Atharva Veda is short and acute, consisting only of one syllable. The Oṃkāara in the Atharvaveda is short and acute.
1.1.25.14	The Oṅkāra in the Yajurveda is acute and acute, consisting in two syllables, A and U, and has four and a half mātrās. The M-syllable is a consonant.
1.1.25.15	The first mātrā is presided over by Brahma, and is red in color.
1.1.25.16	He who always meditates on her, goes to the Brahmic state.
1.1.25.17	She who is the second breath, the deity of Vishnu, is black in color.
1.1.25.18	He who always meditates upon her, goes to Vishnu's state.
1.1.25.19	She is the third breath, the deity Ishana, is tawny in color.
1.1.25.20	One who always meditates her, goes to Ishana's state.
1.1.25.21	The fourth part of the fourth part, which has become manifest as all the deities, moves in space, resembling pure crystal in color.
1.1.25.22	He who always meditates on that attains the state of the Unnamed.
1.1.25.23	The origin of Om.
1.1.25.24	The brahmin who does not know that, is again brought back.
1.1.25.25	Therefore, the words of the Brahmanas should be accepted as they are, just as the son of the Brahmana is to be protected.
1.1.25.26	The Gayatri is the meter.
1.1.25.27	The color is white.
1.1.25.28	The calf is male.
1.1.25.29	Rudra is the deity.
1.1.25.30	Om is the Vedas.
1.1.26.1	What is the meaning of "ko"?
1.1.26.2	It means "to cover".
1.1.26.3	Some say "avati" also.
1.1.26.4	Due to similarity in form, there is similarity in meaning. This is not so.
1.1.26.5	Therefore, the Oṃkāra is the Ap of Apaḥ. The meaning is that it obtains everything. The word ending with a suffix has meaning.
1.1.26.6	The base is not seen.
1.1.26.7	The suffix becomes the name. The grammarians declare that it is Udātta in the case of Nipaṭas. That is Avyaṃbhūta.
1.1.26.8	The word which means something does not go away at any time.
1.1.26.9	It is similar in all three genders and in all cases and in all words. What does not change in that is called avyayam.
1.1.26.10	What is the one that changes and perishes?
1.1.26.11	The lengthening of the vowel.
1.1.26.12	The two forms of the root "āpnoti" are the ones that change.
1.1.26.13	The first "oṃ" is modified.
1.1.26.14	The second "m" is modified. Here is the corrected and aligned text:
1.1.26.15	Thus, the "oṃ" consisting of two letters and one syllable is completed.
1.1.27.1	How many are there?
1.1.27.2	There are three measures in the beginning.
1.1.27.3	For the beginning, one floats.
1.1.27.4	The letter Ma is the fourth.
1.1.27.5	What is the place?
1.1.27.6	The two lips are the place.
1.1.27.7	The two places are the place of exhalation and the place of inhalation.
1.1.27.8	The Sandhi-syllable is a subtle letter, as described, and the remaining one is throat-sound.
1.1.27.9	The first is in the place of opening the mouth.
1.1.27.10	The second is in the place where the mouth is touched.
1.1.27.11-13	There is no conjunction. The teachers of the past used to teach the names, prefixes, anudātta, svarita, and declensions, and they learned by hearing alone and did not ask for the reason.
1.1.27.14	Then the poet Pañcālacaṇḍa, who belonged to the other party, asked, "Let my friends tell me separately the faults of the Udgītha."
1.1.27.15	One should know that it is expressed by letters, syllables, and words.
1.1.27.16	They praise speech that is frequented by the sages and is divided.
1.1.27.17	Therefore, we shall state the reason.
1.1.27.18	This is the future of the castes.
1.1.27.19	We know that the six-limbed science is like this.
1.1.27.20	What is the meter?
1.1.27.21	The meter is Gāyatrī.
1.1.27.22	Gāyatrī is explained as the one-syllabled and white-colored meter of the gods.
1.1.27.23	There are two groups of twelve.
1.1.27.24	This is the grammar, the explanation of the meaning of roots, the explanation of grammar, and the explanation of the Vedas.
1.1.27.25	Then the two sets of twelve are explained in the science of the Vedas.
1.1.27.26	The mantra, the Kalpa, the Brahmana, the Rig, the Yajur, the Sama and the Atharva are the six.
1.1.27.27	This is the Vyahrti of the four Vedas in order: Om, Bhu, Bhuvah, and Svar. These are the Vyahrtis.
1.1.28.1	It is heard that they are used without examination.
1.1.28.2	In the beginning of Dvapara, one part of the sages, Doshapati, was worried here. The three Soma sacrifices were to be performed. It seemed to be over.
1.1.28.3	Therefore, the Rig, Yajur and Sama Vedas lost their radiance.
1.1.28.4	There, the great sages lamented.
1.1.28.5	We have attained great grief and fear.
1.1.28.6	And this was not said by all.
1.1.28.7	We therefore approach the Blessed One.
1.1.28.8	May he be the protector of all of us."
1.1.28.9	Having said "So be it," they remained silent.
1.1.28.10	"Not to those who have not been initiated."
1.1.28.11	They bowed down and said, "We seek initiation."
1.1.28.12	Having initiated them, he said,
1.1.28.13	"Recite your own mantras from the beginning."
1.1.28.14	Thus my own (sacrifices) are performed, but Soma is not drunk by those who know the Vedas of Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras.
1.1.28.15	The priests are defeated.
1.1.28.16	The sacrificer is destroyed by sin.
1.1.28.17	And the Veda is also destroyed and stands (thus).
1.1.28.18	Thus you should destroy each succeeding generation more and more.
1.1.28.19	Thus the power will not be defeated.
1.1.28.20	Thus, thus, O Blessed One!" the teacher of the Veda also says.
1.1.28.21	They became free from sorrow and fear.
1.1.28.22	Therefore, the Brahma-speakers begin with Om.
1.1.29.1	What is the deity?
1.1.29.2	The deity of the verses is Agni.
1.1.29.3	That is the light.
1.1.29.4	The Gayatri metre.
1.1.29.5	The earth is the abode.
1.1.29.6	Having begun with the verse "Agni, the priest, the deity of sacrifice, the officiating priest, the Hotr, the bestower of treasures," one studies the Rig Veda.
1.1.29.7	The deity of the Yajur Veda is Vayu.
1.1.29.8	That is the same light.
1.1.29.9	The Tristubh metre.
1.1.29.10	The space is the abode.
1.1.29.11	Having begun with the words, "To the impulse, to the energy, to the wind, to the god Savitr, may the god Savitr direct you to the best deed," one studies the Yajur Veda.
1.1.29.12	The sun is the deity of the Sama Veda.
1.1.29.13	That is the same light.
1.1.29.14	The Jagata metre.
1.1.29.15	The sky is the place.
1.1.29.16	Having begun with the verse, "O Agni, come for praise, for offering oblations, as the Hotṛ, you sit on the sacrificial grass," one studies the Samaveda.
1.1.29.17	The Atharva Veda has the moon as its deity.
1.1.29.18	That is the same light.
1.1.29.19	All the meters.
1.1.29.20	Water is the abode.
1.1.29.21	Having begun with the verse "May the goddesses be auspicious to us," one studies the Atharva Veda.
1.1.29.22	The world of beings, the immovable and the moving, arises from the waters.
1.1.29.23	Therefore, everything is water-born, everything is born of Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras.
1.1.29.24	These three Vedas are within them, Bhṛgu and Angiras are resorted to. This is the nature of water, with the syllable Om.
1.1.29.25	From this, Vyasa spoke earlier.
1.1.29.26	One who is well-versed in the Vedas of Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras should study other Vedas.
1.1.29.27	One who is not well-versed in Bhṛgu and Angiras should not study other Vedas. 
1.1.29.28	In the Samaveda, the Atharvaveda is heard as an appendix. One who knows this Atharvaveda knows everything. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.1.30.1	The Self, the medicine for the Self, the Self's isolation, and the syllable Om.
1.1.30.2	Having withdrawn the self, one should contemplate the mere union with the truth.
1.1.30.3	The meaning is that one attains the supreme spiritual fruit, surpassing the Vedas.
1.1.30.4	Having contemplated the true meaning through these questions and answers, one who knows the context would be the master of all, as stated in the text of Vakya. This is the Brahmana.
1.1.31.1	Now, the learned Glavā Maitreya approached Ekādaśākṣa Maudgalyāyana, who was living the life of a student.
1.1.31.2	When he saw him living the life of chastity, he said, "What is this? Maudgalyāyanā is studying while living the life of celibacy."
1.1.31.3	That was heard by Maudgalyāyani's student.
1.1.31.4	He told the teacher about it.
1.1.31.5	"He said, "This guest today has spoken ill of you."
1.1.31.6	"Is he learned?"
1.1.31.7	"He said: "He knows the three Vedas."
1.1.31.8	"He said to him, "O gentle one, call that student of yours who is learned and ambitious."
1.1.31.9	He summoned him.
1.1.31.10	He said to him, "So be it."
1.1.31.11	He said, "Yes."
1.1.31.12	"What does your teacher teach?"
1.1.31.13	"He teaches the three Vedas."
1.1.31.14	"Yes."
1.1.31.15	"But, my dear sir, we have all learned the Vedas from the mouth. How does he speak like that?"
1.1.31.16	"How can the learned speak like that to the learned?"
1.1.31.17	He will not answer the question I ask him.
1.1.31.18	Because he does not study.
1.1.31.19	Maudgalyāyana said to his student, "Go, my dear, and attend on Maitreya Glava.
1.1.31.20	Learn the Savitri and the Gayatri, which have twenty-four sources and twelve pairs.
1.1.31.21	In whom the sages Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras have their eyes.
1.1.31.22	In whom all this is established, may you tell her.
1.1.31.23	If he becomes difficult to teach, the teacher will say, "The student of Brahman told Savitri." You should tell the difficult to teach, "You told Maudgalyan."
1.1.31.24	But you did not answer the question he asked you.
1.1.31.25	"You will have misfortune within a year."
1.1.32.1	He went to where the other was.
1.1.32.2	He asked him,
1.1.32.3	but he did not reply.
1.1.32.4	He said, "You have asked a difficult question. You asked Maudgalyan.
1.1.32.5	But you did not answer what he asked you."
1.1.32.6	"You will have misfortune within a year."
1.1.32.7	He said to his disciples, "Go as you please, as you like, as you wish."
1.1.32.8	"I have spoken harshly to Maudgalyāyana."
1.1.32.9	He asked me a question and I did not answer it.
1.1.32.10	I will go to him.
1.1.32.11	I will make peace."
1.1.32.12	Maitreya, in the morning, with a bundle of sacred grass in his hand, approached Maudgalyāyana. "He said, "I am Maitreya, O Venerable Maudgalyāyanan."
1.1.32.13	Why?
1.1.32.14	I spoke to you in a difficult way.
1.1.32.15	I did not answer the question you asked.
1.1.32.16	I will approach you.
1.1.32.17	I will make peace.
1.1.32.18	He said, "Here is everything that is yours. They say that you are moving about in a sinful vehicle."
1.1.32.19	"And this is my good one."
1.1.32.20	"I give it to you."
1.1.32.21	"Go with it."
1.1.32.22	He said, "This is the only thing here that is both true and kind, as you have said."
1.1.32.23	"I will come to you."
1.1.32.24	He went to him.
1.1.32.25	He asked him, "What do they say about Savitar, the desirable, the radiance of the god? What do the poets say about the mind? If you know them, then tell me."
1.1.32.26	"Savitar urges them by which he comes."
1.1.32.27	He said this to him: "The Vedas and the metres are Savitar, the Desirable."
1.1.32.28	The sages say that Bhṛgu is the god, and food is the knowledge.
1.1.32.29	I tell you that Savitā is the one who impels with those (rays).
1.1.32.30	Having approached him, he asked, "Please tell me, who is Savitā and what is Sāvitrī?"
1.1.33.1	The mind itself is Savitā, and speech is Sāvitri.
1.1.33.2	For where there is mind, there is speech, and where there is speech, there is mind."
1.1.33.3	These two are the two sources, one is the pair.
1.1.33.4	Agni itself is Savitar, Savitri is the earth.
1.1.33.5	For where there is Agni, there is earth; where there is earth, there is Agni.
1.1.33.6	These two are the two origins, one is the couple.
1.1.33.7	Wind itself is Savitar; Savitri is the sky.
1.1.33.8	Where there is wind, that is space; where there is space, that is wind.
1.1.33.9	These are the two sources, one pair.
1.1.33.10	The sun itself is Savita, the sky is Savitri.
1.1.33.11	Where there is the sun, that is the sky; where there is the sky, that is the sun.
1.1.33.12	These are two sources, one couple.
1.1.33.13	The moon is Savitr, the stars are Savitri.
1.1.33.14	For wherever there is the moon, there are the stars; and wherever there are the stars, there is the moon.
1.1.33.15	These are the two sources, one pair.
1.1.33.16	The day is Savitr, night is Savitri.
1.1.33.17	Wherever there is day, there is night; and wherever there is night, there is day.
1.1.33.18	These two are the sources, one is the pair.
1.1.33.19	Savitar is indeed heat, Savitri is cold.
1.1.33.20	For where there is heat, that is cold, and where there is cold, that is heat.
1.1.33.21	These two are the sources; one is the pair
1.1.33.22	Savitar is the cloud, Savitri is rain.
1.1.33.23	For where the cloud is, that is rain, and where there are rains, that is the cloud.
1.1.33.24	These two are the two sources, one is the pair.
1.1.33.25	The lightning itself is Savitar, the thunder is Savitri.
1.1.33.26	For wherever there is lightning, there is thunder, and wherever there is thunder, there is lightning.
1.1.33.27	These two are the two origins, one is the couple.
1.1.33.28	The breath itself is Savitar; food is Savitri.
1.1.33.29	Where there is breath, that is food; where there is food, that is breath.
1.1.33.30	These two are the sources, one is the pair.
1.1.33.31	The Vedas themselves are Savitar, the Savitri verses are the Savitri.
1.1.33.32	Where there are the Vedas, those are the verses; where there are the verses, those are the Vedas.
1.1.33.33	These two sources, one pair.
1.1.33.34	The sacrifice itself is Savitar, the Dakshina offerings are the Savitri.
1.1.33.35	Where there is sacrifice, there is Dakṣiṇā; where there is Dakṣinā, there is sacrifice.
1.1.33.36	These two are the two sources of origin, one is the pair.
1.1.33.37	They approached the one who knew this, Opakāra, and said, "He is settled." Then they approached him, and he became like a heap of accumulated things.
1.1.33.38	Then, having risen, he went forth. This is what I know. From these wombs, from these pairs, the celibate student was born to me before my time.
1.1.34.1	Brahma saw this prosperity, this support, this abode.
1.1.34.2	That one who is ascetic.
1.1.34.3	If that were to be upheld in the vow, it would stand in truth.
1.1.34.4	Having created the Brahman, Savita placed it in Savitri.
1.1.34.5	"This is the first foot of Savitri: "This is the most excellent of Savita."
1.1.34.6	He placed the earth in the Rk.
1.1.34.7	He placed Agni in the Rk
1.1.34.8	He placed prosperity in Agni.
1.1.34.9	He placed a woman in prosperity.
1.1.34.10	He placed the pair in a woman.
1.1.34.11	He placed offspring in the pair.
1.1.34.12	He placed work in offspring.
1.1.34.13	By action, austerity.
1.1.34.14	By austerity, truth.
1.1.34.15	By truth, Brahman.
1.1.34.16	By Brahman, the Brahman.
1.1.34.17	By the Brahman, the vow.
1.1.34.18	By the vow, the Brahman becomes purified.
1.1.34.19	It is not empty, it is not cut off, its thread is not cut off and its life is not cut off. He who knows this and he who knows this thus explains this first foot of Savitri.
1.1.35.1	The second foot of Savitri is "We meditate on the shining deity."
1.1.35.2	He placed the Yajus in the atmosphere.
1.1.35.3	He placed the Vayu in the Yajus.
1.1.35.4	The wind causes clouds.
1.1.35.5	Clouds cause rain.
1.1.35.6	Rain causes plants and trees.
1.1.35.7	Plants and trees cause animals.
1.1.35.8	Animals cause work.
1.1.35.9	Work causes austerity.
1.1.35.10	Austerity causes truth.
1.1.35.11	Truth causes Brahman.
1.1.35.12	Brahman causes the Brahmanas.
1.1.35.13	The Brahmanas cause vows.
1.1.35.14	By vows, a Brahmana becomes purified.
1.1.36.4	From the sun, rays.
1.1.36.5	From the rays, rain.
1.1.36.6	From the rain, plants and trees.
1.1.36.7	From plants and trees, animals.
1.1.36.8	From animals, work.
1.1.36.9	From work, austerity.
1.1.36.10	From austerity, truth.
1.1.36.11	From truth, Brahman.
1.1.36.12	From Brahman, the Brahman.
1.1.36.13	From the Brahman, the vow.
1.1.36.14	By the vow, the Brahman becomes purified.
1.1.36.15	He is not empty, he is not cut off, his thread is not cut off; his life is not cut off. He who knows thus, and he who knowing thus explains this third foot of Savitri, he is not empty, not cut off, not cut off is his thread, not cut off his life.
1.1.37.1	By him who knows thus, by the Brahman, Brahman is attained, swallowed, touched.
1.1.37.2	The ether was pervaded, swallowed, and touched by Brahma.
1.1.37.3	The air was pervaded, swalowed, and touched by the ether.
1.1.37.4	The light was pervaded,swallowed, and touched by air.
1.1.37.5	The waters were pervaded, swallowed and touched by light.
1.1.37.6	The earth was pervaded,swollowed, and touched by water.
1.1.37.7	The earth is eaten, swallowed, and touched by food.
1.1.37.8	Food is eaten, swallowed and touched by the vital breath.
1.1.37.9	The mind is eaten, swallowed & touched by the vital breaths.
1.1.37.10	Speech is eaten, swallowed,& touched by the mind.
1.1.37.11	The Vedas are eaten, swallowed &touched by speech.
1.1.37.12	The sacrifice is encompassed, swallowed, and touched by the Vedas.
1.1.37.13	Indeed, these twelve great elements are established for one who knows thus.
1.1.37.14	Among them, the sacrifice alone is the most important.
1.1.38.1	Those who know this think of it thus: "We know him as he is." Those who do not know
1.1.38.2	This sacrifice is established in the Vedas.
1.1.38.3	The Vedas are established in speech.
1.1.38.4	Speech is established in the mind.
1.1.38.5	The mind is established in the breath.
1.1.38.6	The breath is established in food.
1.1.38.7	Food is established in the earth.
1.1.38.8	The earth is established in water.
1.1.38.9	Water is established in light.
1.1.38.10	Light is established in the wind.
1.1.38.11	The wind is established in space.
1.1.38.12	Space is established in Brahman.
1.1.38.13	The Brahman is established in the Brahman-knowing Brahmanas.
1.1.38.14	He who knows thus, knows the Brahman.
1.1.38.15	He attains the auspicious fame and fragrant smells.
1.1.38.16	He is free from sin.
1.1.38.17	He who knows this and he who knowing thus worships Savitri, the mother of the Vedas, the Upanisad of prosperity, attains endless prosperity. Thus is the Brahmana.
1.1.39.1	"The waters generate the embryo."
1.1.39.2	The embryo of the waters is the Purusha.
1.1.39.3	He is the sacrifice.
1.1.39.4	The sacrifice, being led by the waters, moves towards the east.
1.1.39.5	Therefore, one should first take the water for rinsing the mouth.
1.1.39.6	When one rinses the mouth, one does it three times.
1.1.39.7	One sneezes twice.
1.1.39.8	One removes sin by descending from life.
1.1.39.9	Having taken the mantras from the Yajurveda, having applied them, having joined the branches facing east, having placed the water in the palm of the hand without the thumb, saying "This is nectar, this is the spreading of nectar, I spread this for you who are nectar," having brought the water to the palm of the hands, he sips three times with the verse "May you live."
1.1.39.10	When he sips water first, he thus nourishes the seven vital airs in him.
1.1.39.11	The external elements of the body, namely, fire, wind, sun, moon, water, animals and other beings, he thus nourises in him.
1.1.39.12	Water is nectar.
1.1.39.13	When he sips the second time, he thus replenishes them with the seven breaths.
1.1.39.14	The outer measures of the body are these: the full moon, the eighth day, the new moon, faith, consecration, sacrifice, and the sacrificial fee. He thus replenishes them in him.
1.1.39.15	The waters are the immortal.
1.1.39.16	When he sips the third time, he thus nourishes the seven vital airs in him.
1.1.39.17	The external measures of the body are as the earth, the atmosphere and the heaven.
1.1.39.18	The stars, the seasons, the half-seasons and the years, he thus nourishs them in him.
1.1.39.19	Water is immortal.
1.1.39.20	Man is Brahman.
1.1.39.21	Now, the Agni-graha (graha) is performed. Therefore, the learned one says, "This person is like a lotus."
1.1.39.22	This is the breath that lies within. It is said, "It lies within."
1.1.39.23	The breath that lies within is called "person" indirectly.
1.1.39.24	The gods seem to love the indirect and hate the direct.
1.1.39.25-28	When he sips water for the first time, he thereby secures the offerings made before the Homa. When he sips water the second time, he thereby seures the offerings of clarified butter. When he drinks water for the third time, he thereby secues the offerings made after the Homa. When he sips twice, that is the Samit and the sacrificial grass.
1.1.39.29	When it nourishes all the cavities and the entire body, and when the other offering-material, which is the cause of the mantra, is poured into the fire, then everything is secured in it.
1.1.39.30	When he uses mantras beginning with Om, then these are the sacrifices, and he has freedom in all worlds, in all gods, in all Vedas, in all beings, in all creatures. He has freedom and liberation of desire. He does not die in half. He who knows this.
1.1.39.31	This is also said in the Rig Veda: "Water is the form of Bhrigu and Angiras, everything is made of water, everything is made by water, everything is of Bhrigu and Angerasa. The three Vedas follow Bhrigu and Angira."
1.1.39.32	"The flower of water, the form of water, the supreme purity of space."
1.1.39.33	Having sipped water and sprinkled himself, he recites the Brahmanical text, "May Indra protect my life."
1.2.1.1	He says to the teacher, "The student is wandering between the two worlds."
1.2.1.2	He says about the wind, "In him the gods have a common mind."
1.2.1.3	He says of the sun, "He quickly goes from the eastern to the western ocean."
1.2.1.4	The initiated one has long beard.
1.2.1.5	This is the initiated one, this is the one with long beard, this one standing in the place of the teacher is praised as the teacher.
1.2.1.6	Standing in the place of lightning, he is praised as wind. Standing in the place of heaven, he is praised a sun.
1.2.1.7	This is also said in the verse: "The student is praised as the sun." This is the Brahmana.
1.2.2.1	When a Brahmin is born, he is born with seven senses: the power of Brahman, fame, sleep, anger, praise, beauty, and the seventh, the pleasant smell.
1.2.2.2	These senses come to him when he undertakes the life of a Brahmin.
1.2.2.3	His power of Brahman goes to the animals.
1.2.2.4	His fame goes to his teacher.
1.2.2.5	The serpent is the dream.
1.2.2.6	The boar is anger.
1.2.2.7	Water is praise.
1.2.2.8	The maiden is beauty.
1.2.2.9	The herbs and trees are the fragrant incense.
1.2.2.10	He wears the skins of deer, thereby he obtains that brahmic glory which belongs to the deer.
1.2.2.11	He who bathes becomes radiant with brahmic glory.
1.2.2.12	Whatever work he does for the teacher every day, by that he obtains that fame which belongs to the teacher.
1.2.2.13	He becomes famous when he bathes.
1.2.2.14	Whatever sleep he induces when going to sleep, by that he attains that dream which belongs to the serpent.
1.2.2.15-17	When he is asleep, they say to him, "Sleep, do not wake him up." When he is angry, he does not harm anyone with words, thinking that everyone is worse than himself. By that he overcomes the anger that is in him, which is worse than himself.
1.2.2.18	Then one who is praising himself with water should not bathe.
1.2.2.19	He thereby obtains that praise which is in the water.
1.2.2.20	He who has bathed is praised by others.
1.2.2.21	This is the form of a student, that of a maiden.
1.2.2.22	One should not initiate her naked.
1.2.2.23	One should turn the face away, saying, "Thus it is."
1.2.2.24	By that he obtains the form that is in the maiden.
1.2.2.25	They look at him as if he were a maiden.
1.2.2.26	Now this is the auspicious fragrance of the celibate, which is in the plants and trees. If one were to cut off that auspicious fragrance and not smell it,
1.2.2.27	He obtains that merit, which is in the herbs and trees.
1.2.2.28	He who has bathed becomes fragrant with merit.
1.2.3.1	He approaches in four ways: by foot to the fire, by foot to the teacher, by foot to a village, by foot to death.
1.2.3.2	When he brings in the kindling woods and attends on the fire in the evening and morning, he thereby wins that part of him which is in the fire.
1.2.3.3	When he performs a rite for his teacher every day, he thereby wins the part of him which belongs to the teacher.
1.2.3.4	When he enters a village every day to beg for alms and not for sex, he obtains that foot which is in the village.
1.2.3.5	When he is angry, he does not harm anyone with words, thinking that everyone is worse than himself. He obtains that foot which belongs to death.
1.2.4.1	Five fires are indeed set up for the student.
1.2.4.2	Two are in the mouth, one apart from each hand, one in the heart, and one in the anus, the fifth.
1.2.4.3	When he touches a woman with his right hand, he thereby attains the world of the Yajins.
1.2.4.4	When with the left hand, he thereby gains the world of the Pravrajitas.
1.2.4.5	When with his mouth, he thereby gains (the world) of the Agnipraskandi.
1.2.4.6	The heart with which the heroes (fight).
1.2.4.7	The anus with which the householders (live).
1.2.4.8	If he strikes a woman with them, he is left like a fireless (man).
1.2.4.9	What he does every day for the teacher in the family, having done that, he should say: "O Dharma, protect me."
1.2.4.10	Dharma indeed protects him.
1.2.4.11	His progeny becomes better and better every day.
1.2.4.12	One should give in return.
1.2.4.13	He places the ancestors in the heavenly world.
1.2.4.14	One should not wear woolen clothes.
1.2.4.15	If one wears woolen clothes, the nobility increases, not the Brahman.
1.2.4.16	Therefore, one should not wear woolen cloth, so that the Brahman may increase, not the nobility.
1.2.4.17	One should sit below.
1.2.4.18	What is above, that makes the lower self of the breath. What the wind carries.
1.2.4.19	One should sit below, lie below, stand below, go below.
1.2.4.20	Thus indeed did the ancient Brahmanas practice celibacy.
1.2.4.21	They would say to the son or brother who was tormenting him, "Bring him near."
1.2.4.22	One who is going to heaven should eat food from the time of lighting the fire.
1.2.4.23	Then he says, "The buttocks are said to be bathed." From the time of lighting a fire.
1.2.4.24	Because these are not vows.
1.2.4.25	If the teacher addresses him while lying down, he should listen after getting up.
1.2.4.26	If he is lying down, then rising up; if he is rising up, then approaching him; if he is approaching, then fleeing from him.
1.2.4.27	Thus did the ancient Brahmanas practice the life of a Brahmana.
1.2.4.28	And they had this praiseworthy fame: "He will go today."
1.2.5.1	Janamejaya Parikshit, while going on a hunting expedition, was about to shoot two swans when he stopped.
1.2.5.2	They said to Janamejaya Parikshita: "You have come."
1.2.5.3	He said:
1.2.5.4	"Salutations to you, O venerable ones! Who are you, O venerable?"
1.2.5.5	They said: "We are Dakshina Agni and Ahavaniya."
1.2.5.6	He said, "Salutations to you, O Blessed Ones! Please tell me."
1.2.5.7	"Here is a park."
1.2.5.8	"Do the gods not enjoy themselves? The gods do not enjoy themselves."
1.2.5.9	"But the gods come to the park from the park."
1.2.5.10	He said, "Salutlations to you, O blessed ones! What is meritorious?"
1.2.5.11	"Brahmacharya."
1.2.5.12	"What is worldly?"
1.2.5.13	Brahmacharya alone is the highest.
1.2.5.14	Who knows this?
1.2.5.15	Dantala Dhumra.
1.2.5.16	Then Dantala Dhumara came to Parikshit Janamejaya after some time.
1.2.5.17	He got up and himself spread the seat.
1.2.5.18	Having approached him, he asked, "Please tell me what is meritorious?"
1.2.5.19	Brahmacharya.
1.2.5.20	What is worldly?
1.2.5.21	It is celibacy.
1.2.5.22	Therefore, he said this: Celibacy in the Vedas for thirty-eight years.
1.2.5.23	And that is divided into four parts in the Vedas, practicing celibacy for twelve years and twelve years in the lower half.
1.2.5.24	Even while bathing, one should practice according to one's ability.
1.2.5.25	Therefore, he gave a thousand cows to Uhu.
1.2.5.26	One says that the teacher is the one who is praised, but some say that the one who is not praised is the one who practices celibacy, and that space is the deity.
1.2.5.27	Now, the brahmin who practices celibacy is the one who has the feet of the self.
1.2.6.1	Brahma indeed handed over the creatures to Death.
1.2.6.2	He did not hand over the one who practices brahmacharya.
1.2.6.3	He said, "I am afraid of this."
1.2.6.4	What is it?"
1.2.6.5	"The night in which one sleeps without bringing in the kindling wood, that night one loses from one's life."
1.2.6.6	Therefore a student should bring in kindling wood every day and attend the fire in the evening and morning.
1.2.6.7	He should not place it above (the fire), but should establish it.
1.2.6.8	The day on which he would have given something above, that day would be rainy.
1.2.6.9	The gods said, "This one will practice celibacy as a brahmin."
1.2.6.10	"Let him ask for alms," they said. "The householder should say, 'The householder's wife is a great giver.'
1.2.6.11	What should he do if she does not give?"
1.2.6.12	He should seek the wealth of good deeds, of what is desired and accomplished.
1.2.6.13	Therefore, a householder woman should give alms to a student every day, lest she should seek the wealth that is desired and accomplished by him.
1.2.6.14	One should not go beyond the seventh day. If one goes beyond the seventh day, one is not a student.
1.2.6.15	The student who has broken the vow of celibacy should observe the vow of eating alms and collecting firewood for seven nights. Then he should be re-initiated.
1.2.7.1	He should not sleep on a raised bed, sing, dance, or spit.
1.2.7.2	If he sleeps on a raised bed frequently, his dwelling places will be destroyed.
1.2.7.3	If he sings frequently, his children will run away crying.
1.2.7.4	When he dances frequently, the ghosts are removed.
1.2.7.5	When he runs frequently, the people enter.
1.2.7.6	When he spits, he spits in the middle of himself.
1.2.7.7	If he spits, he recites to himself, "May the heaven spit me. Here is honey. Here is juice for me."
1.2.7.8	Whatever poison I have forgotten here, may Agni and Savitar again place it in my belly. Whatever of the juice I have forgotten here has fallen away, that we invoke here. May that again swell me.
1.2.7.9	One should not stand in a cremation ground.
1.2.7.10	If he should stand, having taken water in his hand, reciting the mantra "If this is for the sake of the seasons," and sprinkling while reciting, he should circumambulate.
1.2.7.11	One should go around the boundary.
1.2.7.12	"If this is for seeking the seasons, may the darkness of sin that I have approached be destroyed, like a blind donkey. May it not follow me, wherever the sin is."
1.2.7.13	Now this is the secret of the gods, namely, the student.
1.2.7.14	This is also said in a verse: "This is the secret of gods, the unapproachable, the shining one, in it all animals, in it all sacrifices, in it food with the deities." This is the Brahmanical text.
1.2.8.1	"The son of the great sage Vasishtha, while generating the Prāṇāpānas (vital airs), uttered these words at the mouth of the conch: 'May the cold and heat arise here as seasons.'
1.2.8.2	And so it has always continued."
1.2.8.3	Now, in the middle of Vipāṇa, there is the first hermitage named Vasishthashilā.
1.2.8.4	The second is Krishna-shilas.
1.2.8.5	Vasishtha performed austerities there.
1.2.8.6	Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni, the sons of Jamadagni, are shining.
1.2.8.7	Gautama and Bharadvāja, the lions, are shining in Prabhā.
1.2.8.8	Guṅgu is shining in Guṅguvāsa.
1.2.8.9	The sage is shining in Ṛṣidroṇa.
1.2.8.10	Agastya is shining in Agastyatīrtha.
1.2.8.11	Divya Atri is shining here.
1.2.8.12	Svayambhu Kaśyapa is shining in Kaśyapatuṅga.
1.2.8.13	The dog, the boar, the jackal, the babhruka, and the serpent-bitten, having the power of destroying, are seen from the high peak of Kashyapa, from the enclosure of the Sarana. Success is attained.
1.2.8.14	For a thousand years, the brahmin student stands on one foot in the forest of sages.
1.2.8.15	The second thousand years he placed the stream of nectar on the head.
1.2.8.16	For thirty-eight thousand years, Shiva meditated on the surface of the water.
1.2.8.17	From that heated (water), he meditated further.
1.2.8.18	These verses also say, "Generating Prana and Apana" is the Brahmanical text.
1.2.9.1	One-footed, two-footed, etc.
1.2.9.2	Wind is one-footed.
1.2.9.3	Its foot is space.
1.2.9.4	The moon is two-footed.
1.2.9.5	It has the bright and dark fortnights as its feet.
1.2.9.6	The sun is three-footed.
1.2.9.7	These worlds are its feet.
1.2.9.8	Fire is six-footed.
1.2.9.9	The earth, the sky, heaven, water, plants, and these beings are its feet.
1.2.9.10	All these Vedas have Brahma as their goal, and the four branches of Brahma are established.
1.2.9.11	And they say that there are six, namely, the form, space,
1.2.9.12	The form is in the form of the Rg Veda,
1.2.9.13	The path is in the form the Yajur Veda,
1.2.9.14	The splendor is in the form Sama Veda,
1.2.9.15	The illusion is in the form Bhrigvangiras,
1.2.9.16	This is indeed Brahma itself, the sacrifice with four feet, twice established.
1.2.9.17	His (Agni's) abode is with Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras.
1.2.9.18	They also say that it is one abode.
1.2.9.19	When he makes the circle of the Hotr's verses, he nourishes the earth thereby.
1.2.9.20	For Agni moves in this (earth).
1.2.9.21	This is also said in the verse: "Agni is clothed in earth, the wise one."
1.2.9.22	Whatever the Adhvaryu does with the Yajus, he nourishes the atmosphere with that.
1.2.9.23	In that the wind does not settle down, and no day.
1.2.9.24	This is also said in a verse: "Going along the paths in the atmosphere, he does not settle down and no day. The womb of waters, the first-born of truth, where was he born? From where did he come?"
1.2.9.25	Whatever the Udgātṛ recites with the Sāman, he nourishes heaven by that.
1.2.9.26	For there the sun moves in the bright (sky).
1.2.9.27	This is also said in the Rk: 'The high-flying red Suparna' (RV 10.97.1).
1.2.9.28	Whatever the Brahmaṇācārin recites with the Kanda-s, he nourishes the waters by that.
1.2.9.29	The moon moves in the waters.
1.2.9.30	The Rg Veda also says, "The moon is in the waters." The plants and trees are the stalks of those waters.
1.2.9.31	From them, the sacrifice proceeds with roots, stalks, leaves, flowers, fruits, sprouts, juices, and fragrances.
1.2.9.32	The ears of corn are made from water.
1.2.9.33	Soma is pressed with water.
1.2.9.34	When he invites the Brahmanas to the action, he invites them by means of water.
1.2.9.35	This is his share.
1.2.9.36	As if he were about to eat,
1.2.9.37	he should first sip water and then sip water again. Thus the sacrifice proceeds with water.
1.2.9.38	Therefore, Brahma is established in the waters. The sacrifice proceeds with the offerings made before the establishment of the sacrifice.
1.2.9.39	For the sacrifice is indeed surrounded by the offerings made before and after the establishment of the offerings.
1.2.9.40	For the Bhrigus and Angirasas, having taken the Vedas in between the offerings made before, are considered to be Soma drinkers.
1.2.9.41	For this Veda is indeed of the nature of Soma.
1.2.9.42	This is also said in the verse, "He who drinks Soma thinks of it."
1.2.9.43	Just as this earth, when burning with fire, is pacified by rain.
1.2.9.44	Similarly, Brahma pacifies the disturbance of the sacrifice with the Vyahrtis of Bhrigus and Angiras.
1.2.9.45	Agni pacifies for Aditya.
1.2.9.46	These are the Angirasas.
1.2.9.47	All these attain this.
1.2.9.48	Wind, water, and the moon - these are the Bhrigus.
1.2.9.49	All these nourish this.
1.2.9.50	It becomes one and stable. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.2.10.1	The wise and inquiring son of Kabandhi, the son of Atharvan, was a student.
1.2.10.2	He, with his own haughtiness, did not go to the human world for wealth.
1.2.10.3	His mother said to him:
1.2.10.4	"They themselves said this about food, and they are eating food in the Kurus, Panchālas, Angas, Magadhas, Kāśis, Kośalas, Śālbhas, Matsyas, Savashas, Shinas, and Udicyas."
1.2.10.5	"Now we are starving because of your haughtiness.
1.2.10.6	O son, search for a vehicle."
1.2.10.7	He came to the Soma-born king Mandhāta, the universal monarch.
1.2.10.8	Having entered the assembly hall, he greeted the priests and the sacrificer.
1.2.10.9	Those rivers which flow towards the east, those which flow towards the south, those which flow to the west and those which flow towards north, all these have different names.
1.2.10.10	When they reach the ocean, their names are lost and they are called the ocean.
1.2.10.11	Thus all these Vedas, with their Kalpas, with their mysteries, with their Brahmanas, with their Upanishads, with their Itihasas, with their Anvashasanas, with their Puranas, with their Svaras, with their Sanskaras, with their Niruktas, with their Anu-shasanas, with their Anu Marjanas, with their Vak-ovakas, were created.
1.2.10.12	When they were about to undertake the sacrifice, their names were cut off, and they are called by the name of Yajna.
1.2.11.1	Now, the place where the people of the gods are cut off is the land that slopes towards the east, that slopes towards the west, that is artificial, and that is uneven.
1.2.11.2	This indeed is the divine sacrifice, which is even, with its roots, not burnt, established, sloping towards the north, even, as if spread evenly. Where one knows the Brahmanhood of the Brahman, Brahma makes one Brahman.
1.2.11.3	He said, "I will tell you the Chhandas. We do not know by which we can go beyond."
1.2.11.4	He asked them, "Who, knowing what, performs the duties of the Hotṛ? Who, knowing what, the Adhvaryu? Who, knowing (what), the Udgātṛ? Who, the Brahman, the duties of the Brahman?"
1.2.11.5	They said, "We do not know that by which we may go beyond."
1.2.11.6	We say, the Hotṛ performs the duties of a Hotṛ by means of speech;
1.2.11.7	For the praises and the Vasat-calls are united with speech.
1.2.11.8	We say, "Speech is the Hotar, speech is Brahman, speech is the deity."
1.2.11.9	The Adhvaryu performs the Adhvaryu-function by means of the Prāṇa and Apāna.
1.2.11.10	The beings are led by Prāṇa, the Prāṇa-led are led.
1.2.11.11-15	We say that the Adhvaryu is the Prāṇāpāna (vital airs), the Prāṇapāna is Brahman, the Prāṇapaāna is the deity. The Udgātṛ makes the Udgātṛ by means of the eye. For it is by means of the eyes that these beings see. And the eye itself is the Udgātā, the eye is Brahman, the eye is the deity. The Brahman makes the Brahmanhood by means of the mind.
1.2.11.16	For whatever one does with the mind, whether horizontally, vertically, or upward, that is indeed Brahman.
1.2.11.17	We say that the mind itself is Brahman, the mind is Brahman, the divine mind.
1.2.12.1	Just as the sacrificer and the officiating priests would say, "This is heaven," and the earth would say, "The earth is heaven," and they would say, "Heaven is the earth," then no one else would know it. He knows this in that way. If he were to say this:
1.2.12.2	"How is it?"
1.2.12.3	He should address the Hotṛ priest as "Hotṛ", the Vac priest as "Vac", the Brahman priest as "Brahman", the Dev priest as "Dev". He should address the Adhvaryu priest as "Adhvaryu", the Prāṇāpāna (vital airs) as "Prāṇāpānas", the Brahman priest (as "Brahman"), the Dev priest (as "Dev"). He should address the Udgātṛ priest as "Udgātṛ", the eye as "Eye", the Brahman priest ("Brahman"), the dev priest ("Dev"). He should call the Brahman priest as Brahman, the mind as "Mind", the Brahman priest, the Dev priest.
1.2.13.1	These are the various kinds of sacrifices.
1.2.13.2	Those who sacrifice to the non-Soma drinker, those who sacrifice to the Sura drinker, and those who sacrifice to a Brahmana who has been cut off from the Soma sacrifice, they should approach him in the morning with a bundle of darbha grass, saying, "We are approaching you."
1.2.13.3	Why is this?
1.2.13.4	The questions that you have asked, the same questions you should answer."
1.2.13.5	"He said, "Yes."
1.2.13.6	He answered those questions.
1.2.13.7	"That by which this existing and non-existing is established, that is Brahman.
1.2.14.7	This is the sacrifice.
1.2.14.8	This is the sacrifice of the sacrificer.
1.2.14.9	They sacrifice this.
1.2.14.10	This is divine sacrifice.
1.2.14.11	Now this is the divine sacrifice of faith.
1.2.14.12	Whenever one should offer it,
1.2.14.13	faith alone should not go beyond it.
1.2.14.14	That is the divine sacrifice.
1.2.14.15	This now is the divine sacrifice by the priests.
1.2.14.16	Wherever a learned Brahman performs a ritual with mantras, that is a divine sacrifice.
1.2.14.17	Now this is the divine sacrifice on earth:
1.2.14.18	Where the waters stand and flow, they carry it and convey it, that is a sacrifice to the gods.
1.2.14.19	If it is even, with its roots intact, not burnt, and sloping towards the north, it becomes even like a spread of grass. If there is a pit, a wave, a tree, a mountain, a river, or a path in front,
1.2.14.20	it should not be left out only for the sake of the gods.
1.2.14.21	One should not sit down to the north of the fire." This is the Brahmana.
1.2.15.1	Aditi cooked rice for the sake of offspring.
1.2.15.2	She ate the leftovers.
1.2.15.3	She conceived.
1.2.15.4	Then the Adityas were born.
1.2.15.5	This rice is being cooked, it is indeed the beginning that is being done, the taking possession.
1.2.15.6	The kindling sticks are the size of a span.
1.2.15.7	For this is the size of the self, equal to Prajapati.
1.2.15.8	Agni's sacrificial body, which is in the ashvattha tree, he has attained by that.
1.2.15.9	This is his body of ghee, which is ghee.
1.2.15.10	When he anoints the kindling woods with ghee, he thus makes him prosper by those two bodies.
1.2.15.11	When he places it on the ground, it is done by means of the Avagurta.
1.2.15.12-18	He places it on the path of the one who has no path, by means of the Avagurta. The year is indeed procreation. Fire is procreation. This is procreation. When one places the Samidha in the fire with a verse in the year, then the procreator procreates him from procreation. Man is not born in a season. For he does not know which season he is born in.
1.2.15.19	He obtains that constellation.
1.2.15.20	This is the womb that is made.
1.2.15.21	When the kindling woods are placed, semen is deposited.
1.2.15.22	In a year, semen deposited becomes born.
1.2.15.23	He who lights the fire when a year has passed, deposits it as born.
1.2.15.24	The twelve nights are to be performed before the year.
1.2.15.25	They are the image of the year.
1.2.15.26	Then in three, then in two, then on the previous day, they are to be performed. They are the same as those who perform the Agnihotra.
1.2.15.27	The Adityas came to this world from above.
1.2.15.28	They were the guardians of the path and they repelled him who was approaching.
1.2.15.29	The Aditvas are the partakers of the leftovers.
1.2.15.30	What is left over.
1.2.15.31	He anoints the kindling woods with what is left over. He speaks to them. Having spoken to them, he goes to the heavenly world.
1.2.16.1	Prajapati Atharva, the god, having performed austerities, created this four-fold Brahma-rice, the four-worlds, the four-gods, the four-Vedas, and the four-priesthoods.
1.2.16.2	The four worlds are earth, atmosphere, heaven and water.
1.2.16.3	The four gods are Agni, Vayu, Aditya and Chandrama.
1.2.16.4	The four Vedas are Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, Sama Veda and Brahma Veda.
1.2.16.5	The four offices are Hotra, Adhvaryu, Udgata and Brahma.
1.2.16.6	This is also said in a verse: "He has four horns, three feet, two heads, seven hands, he is bound in three ways, the bull roars. The great god has entered among men."
1.2.16.7	"Four horns" refers to the Vedas.
1.2.16.8	"Three feet" refers to the pressing sessions.
1.2.16.9	The two heads are the two classes of oblations to be offered in the Brahmauḍana rite.
1.2.16.10	The seven hands are the metres.
1.2.16.11	The three-fold binding is the mantra, the Kalpa and the Brahmana.
1.2.16.12	The bull roars. This indeed is the bull. This indeed is what he roars when he recites the sacrificial formulas at sacrifices with the Rig, Yajus, Sama and Brahma verses.
1.2.16.13	The great god has entered the mortals. This indeed is the great god, namely, the sacrifice.
1.2.16.14	He has entered the mortals."
1.2.16.15	"He who knows the seven flowing (rivers) refers to the prāṇas."
1.2.16.16	"He should know the seven flowing (away). "
1.2.16.17	"He who would know the head of the sacrifice refers to the mantra-endowed Brahmaudana, for this is the head of the sacrificie.
1.2.16.18	If one were to approach the Brahmasūtra without the mantra, then one would approach his sacrifice with a lowered head.
1.2.16.19	Therefore one should approach the Brahmasutra with the mantra, not without the mantra, so says the Brahmana.
1.2.17.1	What did Atri know?
1.2.17.2	Darkness enveloped the sun.
1.2.17.3	Atri removed it.
1.2.17.4	Atri saw that.
1.2.17.5	This is also said in a verse: "From the flowing (water), Atri led you to heaven."
1.2.17.6	Atri placed you in heaven, the sun for the month to be done."
1.2.17.7	He said to him, "Choose a boon."
1.2.17.8	He said, "May my offspring be worthy of receiving gifts."
1.2.17.9	Therefore, the first Dakṣiṇā is given to Ātreya at a sacrifice. This is the Brāhmaṇa.
1.2.18.1	Prajāpati said to the Vedas, "Perform the Agnihotra."
1.2.18.2	They said, "The horse is the best of all things."
1.2.18.3	They brought him from the terrible, cruel, watery, and watery place.
1.2.18.4	They said, "The horse is the means of peace."
1.2.18.5	They said, "Let it be so."
1.2.18.6	The Rgveda approached him and said, "I shall pacify the horse."
1.2.18.7	From that approaching, a great fear arose.
1.2.18.8	He went to the eastern direction.
1.2.18.9	He said, "The horse is not pacified."
1.2.18.10	The Yajurveda approached him and spoke, "I shall appease the horse."
1.2.18.11	A great fear arose from that approaching.
1.2.18.12	He chose the western direction.
1.2.18.13	He said, "This horse is not calm."
1.2.18.14	The Samaveda came to him and said, "I can calm the horse."
1.2.18.15	"How will you calm it?"
1.2.18.16	"My Sama Veda is called Rathantara, which is terrible and fierce.
1.2.18.17	"One should chant the horse with that."
1.2.18.18	Therefore, even to him who had approached, it created a great fear.
1.2.18.19	He went to the northern direction.
1.2.18.20	He said, "This horse is indeed restless."
1.2.18.21	Speech addressed them, saying, "Go to Shamyuma Atharvana."
1.2.18.22	Having approached Shamyuma Atharvavana seated, they said, "Let there be salutations to you, O Blessed One, the horse is pacified."
1.2.18.23	"So be it."
1.2.18.24	He then addressed his son Kabandha, the son of Atharva, saying, "O Vicārin!"
1.2.18.25	"Yes, sir," he replied.
1.2.18.26	"The horse is to be pacified."
1.2.18.27	"So be it."
1.2.18.28	He performed the rite of sprinkling with water for peace, using the Atharvanīya and Āṅgirasa mantras, the Catana mantras, the names of the mothers, and the Vastospați mantras. He pacified (the horse).
1.2.18.29	When the horse was bathed and sprinkled, embers fell from all the rows of hairs on its body.
1.2.18.30	The horse, being pleased, bowed down.
1.2.18.31	Salutations to the Atharvan who made me fit for sacrifice.
1.2.18.32	In the future, other Brahmins will have light burdens.
1.2.18.33	They will place the foot of the sun on the back of a bull, a goat, a sheep, or a student.
1.2.18.34	The foot of the sun is the earth.
1.2.18.35	It will be placed on its own foot.
1.2.18.36	When the horse is being led to the fire, the Brahman makes the sacrificer recite the verse, "When he cried out first at birth." There are five verses.
1.2.18.37	The Brahmanas lead him (to the fire). The Brahman makes him approach the Brahman.
1.2.18.38	He alone is the knower of all, who knows the lore of Bhrigus and Angirasas. This is the Brahmana.
1.2.19.1	The gods and the Asuras were contending.
1.2.19.2	The gods said to Indra, "Protect this sacrifice of ours till we have conquered the Asuras."
1.2.19.3	"Protect us in that form by which thou canst best conceal us."
1.2.19.4	He became the Rigveda and stood in front.
1.2.19.5	The gods said to him, "Make another form, not with this form do you cover us most. With this you will not be able to protect."
1.2.19.6	Having become the Yajur Veda, he approached from behind and stood.
1.2.19.7	The gods said to him, "Make another form, not with this form do you cover us most. With this you will not be able to protect."
1.2.19.8	Having become the Samaveda, he approached from the north.
1.2.19.9	The gods said to him, "Make another form, not with this form you will cover us more, with this you will not be able to protect."
1.2.19.10	He, Indra, having become the knower of Brahman, having gone around on the right side, stood near.
1.2.19.11	The gods said to him, "Make that form, with that form you will be able to cover us the most and protect us."
1.2.19.12	When he, having become the knower of Brahman, approached from the right side wearing a turban, that became Brahman.
1.2.19.13	That is the Brahmanhood of Brahman.
1.2.19.14	That is the form of Atharvan, that is Brahma with a turban.
1.2.19.15	The Visve Devas approached him from the right.
1.2.19.16	Because the Visve Devas came to him from the right, he became the Sadasyas.
1.2.19.17	That is the reason for the Sadasyas being called Sadasyas. The Sadasyas are the Sadasyas because they are the Sadasyus.
1.2.19.18	One obtains the strength of Bala by being a Sadasyu.
1.2.19.19-22	The southern direction is terrible, the others are peaceful. The directions that are praised, he praises with the mind, reciting the formula, "May the members of the assembly be born." He generates himself, saying, "May I be born," and establishes himself in the state of being born.
1.2.19.23	The gods said to him, "Choose a boon."
1.2.19.24	He said, "I choose."
1.2.19.25	He chose the boon,
1.2.19.26	"May they stand praising, praising, praising me as Indra in this very office of Hotr."
1.2.19.27	They stood praising, praising, praisng him as Indra in this same office of Hotr.
1.2.19.28	When they, having become Indra, again stood in that very office, praising, reciting, and eulogising, then he became the Brahman-acchāsin.
1.2.19.29	That is why the Brahman-acchamsin is called Brahman-acchaṃsin.
1.2.19.30	The Brahman-acchamin's office is the second.
1.2.19.31	Choose a second boon, he said.
1.2.19.32	He chose.
1.2.19.33	He chose this boon:
1.2.19.34	May they stand praising me, in the form of Vayu, in this very Hotr-priestess.
1.2.19.35	They stood praising him, in the form Vayu, in that very Hotr-priesthood.
1.2.19.36	Because they stood praising him, who was in the form of the wind, in that very Hotri-priesthood, he became the Potri.
1.2.19.37	That is the Potri's Potrihood.
1.2.19.38-42	This is the Vāyu-priestess, the Potri-priestess. Choose a third boon." He chose. He chose this boon: "May the kindlers of the fire, praising and reciting, stand in me as the Agni-priestess."
1.2.19.43	The kindlers, having made him Agni in that very office, worshipped, praised and praised him.
1.2.19.44	In that the kindlers, having turned him into Agni in that very post, worshipped, praised, and praised him, he became the Agnidhra.
1.2.19.45	That is the Agnidhra's Agnidhra-ness.
1.2.19.46	This is the Agni-related Hotr-priest. This is the meaning of the Brāhmaṇa.
1.2.20.1	Brahmana alone carried this Agni Vaiśvānara.
1.2.20.2	This Agni Vaiśvânara, being carried by the Brāhmaṇas, generates these worlds.
1.2.20.3	Then this Agni, the knower of all, looks at him. The Brahman is his second. This Agni Vaisvānara burns here.
1.2.20.4	"He thought, "I will show him the power, strength and energy that are in me. He may then give me something."
1.2.20.5	Having nourished himself, he put the milk below.
1.2.20.6	Having shown this Brahman, he offered it to himself.
1.2.20.7	Having nourished his second self, he offered this ghee.
1.2.20.8	Having shown this Brahman, (he offered it) to himself.
1.2.20.9	Nourishing his third self, he offered all this diverse food.
1.2.20.10	Having shown this Brahman, he offered it to himself.
1.2.20.11	Having nourished his fourth self, he saw the Brahman's wife Viraj.
1.2.20.12	He gave her to him.
1.2.20.13	He became the possessor of a self.
1.2.20.14	Then they went away from this Agni Vaisvānara. The Brahman placed Agni Jātavedas.
1.2.20.15	He said, "O Agni, the knower of beings, make me a deposit."
1.2.20.16	He gave him two names: Aghaura and Akrūra.
1.2.20.17	He became a horse.
1.2.20.18	Therefore a horse cannot pull a chariot with its back or a rider with its front.
1.2.20.19	He approached the gods.
1.2.20.20	He stood with the gods.
1.2.20.21	Therefore the gods were afraid.
1.2.20.22	He gave it to Brahma.
1.2.20.23	He pacified it with this verse:
1.2.21.1	"They call you Agni Vaiśvānara, who burns down houses. You have gone away. O god, do tell us, lest we should suffer from your wrath."
1.2.21.2	He pacifies it with these five verses: "When you cried out first at birth..."
1.2.21.3	It was pacified.
1.2.21.4	Therefore the horse is the most hungry of animals.
1.2.21.5	For he is indeed the universal fire.
1.2.21.6	Therefore one gives a horse to the Brahman with the word "fire."
1.2.21.7	For it is given to the Brahman.
1.2.21.8	He pressed out its juice.
1.2.21.9	That became juice.
1.2.21.10	For this is indeed juice.
1.2.21.11	They call him who is that juice "chariot" indirectly.
1.2.21.12	The gods, indeed, are like those who love from afar, but hate those who are near.
1.2.21.13	He approached the gods.
1.2.21.14	He stood in front of the gods.
1.2.21.15	Therefore the gods were afraid.
1.2.21.16	He gave him to Brahma.
1.2.21.17	He offered him with this hymn and oblation of ghee.
1.2.21.18	"The strength of Indra, the army of Maruts" - having offered the chariot with this verse, he stood with this verse: "O lord of the forest, be the best of the trees."
1.2.21.19	Therefore, he gives the chariot to be placed near Agni to the Brahman.
1.2.21.20	For the Brahman is the giver.
1.2.21.21	The carpenter fashioned the best body of the chariot as the southern direction.
1.2.21.22	He saw her in the five, in the Rk, Yajus, Saman, in the peaceful and in the terrible.
1.2.21.23	Of those two he gave to Brahman, speech and light.
1.2.21.24	Speech is the cow, light is gold.
1.2.21.25	Therefore he gives to Brahman a cow for Agni, to be eaten in four parts.
1.2.21.26	For it is given to Brahman.
1.2.21.27	When the animals are pacified, they close their eyes.
1.2.21.28	He places the eye in himself.
1.2.21.29	What is the eye, that is gold.
1.2.21.30	Therefore, one gives gold to the Brahman for the Agnihotra.
1.2.21.31	For it is given to the Brahman.
1.2.21.32	He placed it in himself.
1.2.21.33	With that he kindled.
1.2.21.34	What he did not place, that became Agni.
1.2.21.35	Then she became a fire and entered the ocean.
1.2.21.36	She burned the ocean.
1.2.21.37	Therefore the ocean is difficult to cross.
1.2.21.38	For it was burned by Vaisvānara.
1.2.21.39	She rose up from the earth.
1.2.21.40	She burned up the earth.
1.2.21.41	Then she approached the gods.
1.2.21.42	She attacked the gods.
1.2.21.43	Then the gods ran to Brahma.
1.2.21.44	He neither sang nor danced.
1.2.21.45	This is the Agla.
1.2.21.46	This is the Karuvida.
1.2.21.47	They call him who is really Aglahat, Aglagrid, indirectly.
1.2.21.48	For the gods are fond of the indirect and hate the direct.
1.2.21.49	He who is a singing or dancing Brahman, they call him Aglagrid.
1.2.21.50	Therefore, a brahmin should neither sing nor dance, lest he become a Magha or a Grdhra.
1.2.21.51	Therefore, the Brahmic offering is first, and the Prajapatya offering is later.
1.2.21.52	The Brahmic offering is superior to the Prajapaty. This is the Brahmana.
1.2.22.1	Artha and Angirasa saw the eyes of Bhrigu, and that became Brahma.
1.2.22.2	Not knowing that, we say, "All this is the Bhrigus and Angirasas."
1.2.22.3	Those gods offered the Brahmic oblation in the fire of Sāntapana.
1.2.22.4	This indeed is the Brahmic oblution that is offered in the fire of Santāpana.
1.2.22.5	This indeed, is the fire of Santăpana, namely, the Brāhman.
1.2.22.6	The gods worshipped his strength, the fathers his good will, the Brahmanas his heaven, through faith.
1.2.22.7	The Rishis, the women, and the men, having worshipped him, have found their own selves. Both the Rishis and the women worship him.
1.2.22.8	If the Brahmanas had not offered the Brahmana oblation at the sacrifice, the men would have been born as the offspring of the Prajapati oblation.
1.2.22.9	He who hears these worlds, he is the father of the Āhavanīya, the Garhapatya and the Dakṣiṇāgni, he who offers Agnihotra.
1.2.22.10	The gods rejoice in their beloved abode.
1.2.22.11	Of them this Agni is the best, the one who soothes.
1.2.22.12	When his speech is satisfied, Agni is satisfied.
1.2.22.13	When the vital breath is satisfied, the wind is satisfied.
1.2.22.14	When the eye is satisfied, the sun is satisfied.
1.2.22.15	 When the mind is satisfied, the moon is satisfied.
1.2.22.16	When the ear is satisfied, the directions and the intermediate directions are satisfied.
1.2.22.17	When affection is satisfied, the waters are satisfied.
1.2.22.18	 When the hair is satisfied, the herbs and trees are satisfied.
1.2.22.19	When the body is satisfied, the earth is satisfied.
1.2.22.20	Thus this fire, the best of fires, when satisfied, satisfies all those who are satisfied. Thus says the Brāhmaṇa.
1.2.23.1	"This oblation is for Sāntapana."
1.2.23.2	This indeed is the fire of Sāntapana, that is, the Brāhmaṇa, for whom the rites of impregnation, conception, the first, second and third months of pregnancy, birth, naming, leaving the house, eating food, tonsure, initiation, immersion, Agnihotra, observance of vows, etc. are performed. He is Sāntapāna.
1.2.23.3	But he who is without fire is a lump of clay in a pot.
1.2.23.4	Just as a clod of earth thrown into a pot is not fit for cleaning or for growing crops, so also is this brahmin without fire. The brahmin without fire does not give to the gods, does not give to ancestors, and his blessings of study and blessings of sacrifice do not lead to heaven.
1.2.23.5	This is also said in the verse: "We choose Agni as our messenger, the Hotar, the knower of all, the well-intentioned one of this sacrifice." This is the Brahmana.
1.2.24.1	Then Prajapati, about to perform a Soma sacrifice, said to the Vedas, "Whom shall I choose as your Hotr, whom as Adhvaryu, whom as Udgātṛ, and whom as Brahman?" They said, "Choose the one who knows the Rig Veda as Hotr, the one who knows Yajur Veda as Adhvaryus, the one who knowes Sama Veda as Udgātā, and the one who knows Atharva Veda as Brahman.
1.2.24.2	Thus the sacrifice is established in the four worlds, the four gods, the four Vedas, and the four Hotr priests. The sacrifice stands firm with four feet for one who knows this. One who knows this stands firm with offspring and cattle.
1.2.24.3	Therefore, choose a Hotr priest who knows the Rig Veda, for he knows the Hotr duties. Agni is the Hotr.
1.2.24.4	Earth is the abode of the verses, Agni is the deity, the Gayatri metre is the bright one.
1.2.24.5	Therefore, choose him as your Hotr for the conquest of this world, for the victory of this world,
1.2.24.6	for the conquest of this worlds, for the subjugation of this world, 
1.2.24.7	for the expansion of this world, and for the prosperity of this world.
1.2.24.8	For the exaltation of this world, for the pervasion of this world,
1.2.24.9	for the sufficiency of this world, and for the completion of this world.
1.2.24.10	If he does not choose a Hotr who knows this, then his sacrifice is lost before them. Choose an Adhvaryu who knows the Yajur Veda, for he knows the Adhvaryu's duties.
1.2.24.11	Vayu is the Adhvaryus, the atmosphere is the abode of the Yajur Veda.
1.2.24.12	The wind is the deity, the Tristubh metre, the word 'Bhuva' is the bright one. Therefore, you should choose that Adhvaryu. For this world.
1.2.24.13	If he does not choose the Adhvaryu in this way, then his sacrifice is lost afterwards. Choose the Udgata as the Udgata.
1.2.24.14	He knows the Udgata, the sun is the Udgata.
1.2.24.15	The heaven is the abode of the Saman, the sun is the deity, the Jagat metre, and the Sukra verse.
1.2.24.16	Therefore, choose him as your Udgātṛ. This world is his. If they do not choose the Udgātṛ who knows this, then their sacrifice is lost to them.
1.2.24.17	Then choose Brahma who knows the Atharva-Angirasa Veda, for he knows the nature of Brahma.
1.2.24.18	The moon is Brahma, and the waters are the abode of the Bhrigus and Angirasas.
1.2.24.19	The Moon is the deity, the lightning is the heat, the Kakubha is the metre. "Oṃ" is the seed of the Atharva Veda, "Janad" is the seed for the Angirasas. "Therefore, choose that very Brahman for the conquest of this world."
1.2.24.20	For the conquest of this universe, for the victory of this universe,
1.2.24.21	For the subjugation of this universe, and for the expansion of this universe,
1.3.1.2	Therefore, the sacrifices are like the elevated part of that land where the Bhrigus and Angirasas have their abode.
1.3.1.3	Just as the rivers carry these worlds, in the same way, the Bhrigus, and Angirasas carry all the gods.
1.3.1.4	In the same way, this utterance carries all the Vedas, namely, "Om" for the Rig Veda, "Om"for the Yajur Veda, "Om " for the Sama Veda, and "Om" for all the Vedas. This is the salutation.
1.3.1.5	The learned ones perform this at the end of the sacrifice.
1.3.1.6	The gods come to Brahma, saying, "Come, come!"
1.3.1.7	These are indeed the gods Brahma, namely, the Bhrigus and Angirasas.
1.3.1.8	They call them, they invite them, they think of them.
1.3.1.9	No one other than a knower of the Bhṛgu and Angirasa hymns should be invited to a sacrifice.
1.3.1.10	He attains the brilliance of the sacrifice through its brilliance, the strength through its strength, the fame through its fame.
1.3.1.11	No one else who knows the Bhṛgu-Angirasa hymns should come to the sacrifice, lest he should cover the sacrifice.
1.3.1.12	Just as a calf, having learned, would milk a cow, so the Brahman, knowing the Vedas of Bhṛgu and Angiras, having been appointed, would come to the sacrifice, lest he should neglect the sacrifice.
1.3.1.13	Just as a cow or a horse or a donkey would be called "one-footed," "two-footed," or "three-footed," what would it carry? What would it enjoy?
1.3.1.14	Therefore, choose the Hotṛ who knows the Ṛgveda, the Adhvaryu who knows the Yajurveda, the Udgātṛ who knows the Sāmaveda, and the Brahman who knows the Atharva-Angirasa Veda.
1.3.1.15	Thus his sacrifice stands firm in the four worlds, the four gods, the four Vedas, and the four Hotr priests.
1.3.1.16	He who knows this and he who knows the duties of the priests at the sacrifice and he who knows what is to be sacrificed at the sacrifice, such a one prospers with offspring and cattle. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.3.2.1	Prajapati created the sacrifice.
1.3.2.2	He performed the duties of the Hotri with the Rigveda, the Adhvaryu with the Yajurveda, the Udgata with the Samaveda, and the Brahma with the Atharva-Angiras.
1.3.2.3	He makes this great sound, namely, he makes the Hotr-office with the Ṛg-verses, the Adhvaryu-office with the Yajus-verses, the Udgātṛ-office with the Sāman-verses, and the Brahman-office with the Atharva-Angiras-verses.
1.3.2.4	This sacrifice is indeed being performed by means of three Vedas.
1.3.2.5	The Brahman performs the other half of the sacrifice with his mind.
1.3.2.6	This indeed is the sacrifice that blows.
1.3.2.7	Its mind and speech are its means of movement.
1.3.2.8	For the sacrifice moves by means of mind and speech.
1.3.2.9	The mind is indeed here, and speech is there.
1.3.2.10	If one speaks and there is no knowledge, one should know that half of one's sacrifice has been lost.
1.3.2.11	Just as a man with one leg or a chariot with one wheel, when moving, would soon break down, so does his sacrifice break down.
1.3.2.12	The sacrificer breaks down following the breakdown of the sacrifice.
1.3.2.13	The priests break down following the breakdown in the sacrificer.
1.3.2.14	The sacrificial gifts break down following the priests' breakdown.
1.3.2.15	The sacrificer, following the loss of the Dakṣiṇās, loses his sons and cattle.
1.3.2.16	The sacrificer, following loss of sons and cattle, loses heaven.
1.3.2.17	Following the loss of heaven, the prosperity of that half of the year in which sacrifices are performed, is lost. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.3.3.1	Now Śvetaketu Āruṇi, seeing the Brahman reciting, said: "Half of this sacrifice of mine has been lost."
1.3.3.2	Therefore, the Brahman should recite outside the Pavamāna verses, restraining speech, in the Upaṃśu and Antarāma verses.
1.3.3.3	Now those Pavamāna verses that are Odic, in them.
1.3.3.4	Now those hymns which have weapons, up to the Vasat-call.
1.3.3.5	If he were to omit a verse from the Rg, he should offer on the Garhapatya with "Om, Bhuvar Janat."
1.3.3.6	If from the Yajur, with "Om, Bhurvar Janat" on the Dakshina Agni.
1.3.3.7	If from the Sama, with "Om Svar Janat" on Ahavaniya.
1.3.3.8	If one does not know the Brahman, one should offer on the Ahavaniya fire with the words "Bhuvah, Bhuvah, Svarah, Janah, Om."
1.3.3.9	This is the praise of the Vedas, the Yajuses, the Sāmans, and the Atharva-Angirasas.
1.3.3.10	And also the taste of the Vedas is united with the sacrifice.
1.3.3.11	As it is said, "Just as with salt."
1.3.3.12	Just as a man or a chariot with two wheels, when moving, comes to a halt, so does his sacrifice come to a halt.
1.3.3.13	The sacrificer comes to a halt following the halt of the sacrifice.
1.3.3.14	The priests come to a halt following halt of the sacrificer.
1.3.3.15	The non-fulfillment of the sacrificial fees follows from the non-fulfillment (of the rites) by the priests.
1.3.3.16	The non-fulfillment by the sacrificer of his sons and cattle follows from the nonfulfillment of the fees.
1.3.3.17	The nonfulfillment of heaven follows from the non fulfillment of the sons and cattle.
1.3.3.18	The loss of the heaven world is the loss of the half of the world in which they perform sacrifices. This is the Brahmanical explanation.
1.3.4.1	The Udumbara-vessel is placed in the middle of the sacrificial ground. The Udgātṛ recites the hymn "Oṃ, I have sat down, I have come, I have gone up, I have been called in the Subrahmaṇya-vessel." The Dakṣiṇā is taken to the Udgātṛ.
1.3.4.2	"He has taken the Grahas for me, he has proclaimed for me, he made the Sāmans for me, he did not make me wait, he has pronounced the Vasat for me" - thus to the Adhvaryu.
1.3.4.3	"He has made me wait, he made me wait, has pronounced the Vasāt for me" - to the Hotṛ.
1.3.4.4	May the Brahmana have blessed me with the divine worship, may he have bestowed on me the Brahmasad, may he have recited the Brahmajapas for me, may he have performed the Homa-s before the Homa-sthiti, may he have sought me, may he be pleased with me, may he bestow the Vasat-kara on me. Thus to the Brahmana.
1.3.4.5	May he have done me the most with the Brahmana. Thus to the Brahma.
1.3.4.6	This is the most extensive Brahman, namely, the Bhrigus and Angirasas.
1.3.4.7	Those who are Angirasas, that is the essence; those who are Atharvans, that is the remedy.
1.3.4.8	What is the remedy, that is the nectar; what is the nectar, that is Brahman.
1.3.4.9	Now this is the half of the share of the former priests, and the other half of the others, and half of the Brahman. Thus says the Brahmana.
1.3.5.1	Now the gods and the Asuras were engaged in a battle.
1.3.5.2	In that battle, these three Hotr-priests went to the side of the Asuras.
1.3.5.3	Indra composed the hymns and chants for them.
1.3.5.4	He gave them to the Hotr.
1.3.5.5	The Hotr became the sacrificer's share.
1.3.5.6-11	The Prāga-sāman is the Vaiśvadeva of the Hotṛ. The Niṣkevalya is the Neṣṭṛ. The Marutvatīya is the Hotṛ. The Āgnimārut is the Āgnīdhra. Therefore this (sāman) is more frequently sung than the Āgnimāruta. Therefore these (sāmans) are like those who praise, namely the Hotṛ, the Potr and the Neṣṭr.
1.3.5.12	Agnidhra should be confused.
1.3.5.13	That is the Brahmanical way of doing it.
1.3.5.14	Of those, half is the first offering and the first step, and this is the right one. This is what is left over. This is what the Brahmanas say.
1.3.6.1	Uddalaka, son of Aruni, made the northern people run away.
1.3.6.2	He had a gold coin hidden away, fearing that he might be censured. He thought, "I will give this to the brahmin who censures me."
1.3.6.3	He was afraid of the brahmins from the north, thinking, "Uddālaka is coming, the brahmin from Kuru and Pañcāla, the son of a brahmin."
1.3.6.4	He was surrounded from above and did not go down.
1.3.6.5	By whom was this hero subdued?
1.3.6.6	They said to him, "O Saunaka, you are the most learned among us."
1.3.6.7	"By whom was this hero subjugated?"
1.3.6.8	They said to Saunaka, "You are the most learned one among us."
1.3.6.9-11	Then the Svaidhayanas addressed him thus: "He is the son of Gautama." He heard the slanderous words of the Svaidhayana. He, the son of Gautam, ran away.
1.3.7.1	Who knows the form of the Darsha-Pūrnamāsa? Why are these creatures born with hair on the head first? Why do they have other hairs growing on their cheeks and shoulders?
1.3.7.2	Who knows the form of the Darsha-Pūrnamāsa, why do these creatures become grey-haired first from the head and then all over?
1.3.7.3	Who knows the form of Darsha-Pürnamāsa, from what do these creatures become toothless and then grow again as if they were different.
1.3.7.4	Who knows the form of the Darsha-Pūrnamāsa, why do the teeth of seven and eight years fall off? Why do they grow again? Why do they fall off altogether at last?
1.3.7.5	Who knows the form of Darsha-Pürnamāsa, the lower teeth grow first and the upper teeth later.
1.3.7.6	Who knows the form of the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices, why are the lower teeth smaller, shorter, wider, and older than the upper ones?
1.3.7.7	Who knows the form of those sacrifices, why are these two fangs longer, and why are they like even jaws?
1.3.7.8	Who knows the form of the Darsha-Pūrnamāsa, why are these ears within, as if pierced in the same place?
1.3.7.9	Who knows the form of Darsha-Pürnamāsa, for what reason men have beards and women do not have beards?
1.3.7.10	Who knows the form of those Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices? Why is their body always like a continuous stream? Why are their bones so hard?
1.3.7.11	Who knows the form of the Darsha-Pūrnamāsa, why does the semen discharged in the first stage of their life not become a child? Why does the semen discharged at the middle stage of their life become a child? And why does the semen not become a child when discharged in the last stage of their life?
1.3.7.12	Who knows the form of Darsha-Paurnamasa, why does this penis rise up and fall down?
1.3.7.13	Why is it called the single exhalation?
1.3.8.1	Now, he who knows eight portions of clarified butter in front, five portions of oblations in the middle, six portions of Prajapati, and eight portions of clarified butte above,
1.3.8.2	he who knows the Gayatri, the swift, the luminous, carrying the sacrificer to heaven with all the sacrifices,
1.3.8.3	Now he who knows the five-fold, seven-teen-syllabled verse, which carries the sacrificer to heaven by all sacrifices,
1.3.8.4	to him, while giving a gold coin, Anūchāna said, "You are indeed a descendant of Suvid." "I give gold to one who knows gold."
1.3.8.5	Having taken it, he went out.
1.3.8.6	There he went away to where the other was.
1.3.8.7	He asked him, "Is this the son of Gautama?"
1.3.8.8	He replied, "This is Brahma, the son of Brahma. If anyone were to accuse or examine him, his head would fall off or his life would leave him."
1.3.8.9	They both cried out, "O brahmin, go to where the other one is!"
1.3.8.10	They approached him in the morning with their hands joined in salutation, saying, "We desire to learn from you."
1.3.8.11	Why?
1.3.8.12	"Those very questions that you asked us, please explain them to us."
1.3.8.13	"So be it."
1.3.8.14	He explained those questions to them.
1.3.9.1	Because he first strews the grass in front of the Veda, therefore the hair on the head of these creatures is born first.
1.3.9.2	Because he strews the grass as if it were a second mound, therefore the hair of their beards and the other hairs are born as if they were a second mound.
1.3.9.3	When he strikes the Prastara on the Barhis first, therefore the hair turns grey first on the head of these creatures.
1.3.9.4	When he strikes everything at the end, therefore the hair becomes grey at the end of everything.
1.3.9.5	When the Prayājas are without Puronuvākyās, therefore these creatures are born without teeth.
1.3.9.6	Because the offerings to the gods have the Puronuvākyā, therefore they are born again.
1.3.9.7	Because the Anuyājas do not have the Puronūkyā, therefore at the age of seven and eight they are separated.
1.3.9.8	Because the Patnīsaṁyājas have the Puronūkya, therefore they are reborn.
1.3.9.9	When the Samitsya-yajus is recited, it is as if the Anuvakya is repeated. Therefore, at the end, all teeth are born.
1.3.9.10	When the Gāyatrī is recited and the Tristubh is offered, therefore, the lower teeth are born first and the upper teeth later.
1.3.9.11	When the Rk is recited and the Yajus is offered, therefore the lower teeth are smaller, shorter, wider, and older than the upper teeth.
1.3.9.12	Because he offers the two long libations going forward, therefore these teeth are longer.
1.3.9.13	Because the Samyājyā is in the same metre, therefore the jaws are as it were even.
1.3.9.14	Because he offers the fourth Prajāpati, therefore these ears are as it were turned inwards and even.
1.3.9.15	Because he recites the formula while reciting the Jāpa, therefore men have beards and women have hair.
1.3.9.16	Because he recites the Sāmidhenī verses while reciting the Anvāha, therefore their bodies are like continuous.
1.3.9.17	Because the Sāmidhēnī verses are made of wood, therefore their bones are like hard.
1.3.9.18	Since the Prayāja offerings are made with ghee as the oblation, therefore the semen deposited in them in the first stage of life does not become fruitful.
1.3.9.19	Since in the middle of the offerings they proceed with curds and cake, therefore the semen that is deposited in them in their middle stage of life becomes fruitful.
1.3.9.20	Since the Anuyāja offerings are made of ghee as the oblations, therefore the semen which is deposited in them at the last stage of life does no become fruitful.
1.3.9.21	When one makes the final offering of the Anuyaja, it comes out from the highest (part of the body). Therefore, the penis comes out high and the anus becomes low.
1.3.9.22	If one does not make the final offering, it would be empty.
1.3.9.23	If one makes the final offerings repeatedly, it would be full.
1.3.9.24	Therefore, one makes the final offer- ing once, so that it is not empty or full.
1.3.10.1	Now those eight portions of clarified butter which are in front, the five Prayājas, the two Āghāras, the two portions of clarified butter, the Āgneya is the first of the portions of clarified butter; the Saumya is the second; the Havirbhagā is the first of those having oblations.
1.3.10.2	For the Saumya indeed is an oblation.
1.3.10.3	The Āgneya is a cake.
1.3.10.4	The oblations to Agni and Soma, the oblation to Agni Sviṣṭakṛt, these five oblations are in the middle.
1.3.10.5	Then those six oblations to Prajapati, the Idā, the Prāśitra, what is offered to the Āgnīdhra, the share of the Brahman, the share of Yajamāna, and the Anvāhārya alone is the sixth.
1.3.10.6	Now those eight oblations of ghee, the three Anuyājas, the four Patnīsaṃyājas, and the Samīṣṭayāja are the eighth.
1.3.10.7	Now that Gāyatrī, the swift-moving, having the rays for wings, carries the sacrificer to the heavenly world by all the sacrifices, that is the altar.
1.3.10.8	Those eight oblations of clarified butter which are in front of it are its right wing.
1.3.10.9	Now the eight portions of clarified butter above that are the northern wing.
1.3.10.10	The oblations are the body.
1.3.10.11	The Garhapatya is the buttocks.
1.3.10.12	The Ahavaniya is the head.
1.3.10.13	The golden and silver wings.
1.3.10.14	Because they do not see the sun completely in front, therefore the heap of wood becomes without light.
1.3.10.15	Now that verse which has five feet and seventeen syllables, which carries the sacrificer to heaven with all the sacrifices, is indeed the one to be sacrificed.
1.3.10.16	It has four syllables, "Let it be heard."
1.3.10.17	It has four more syllables, "Let him hear."
1.3.10.18	It has two syllables, "Let us sacrifice."
1.3.10.19	It has five syllables, "Let those who sacrifice."
1.3.10.20	The Vasat-call has two syllables. This is the verse.
1.3.10.21	It has five feet and seventeen syllables. It carries the sacrificer to the heavenly world by all sacrifices.
1.3.10.22	Wherever his lordship may be, wherever they may carry him, one should choose a Brahman who knows this, not one who does not know this. Such is the Brahmanical text.
1.3.11.1	Then indeed Pracinayoga came and asked Agnihotri Gautama: "I ask you, O Gautama."
1.3.11.2	Ask Prachinayoga.
1.3.11.3	What deity is the cow when it is milked?

1.3.11.6	What deity the calf when it is being led away?

1.3.11.25	Which deity are you preparing to offer?
1.3.11.26	Which deity have you prepared to offer?
1.3.11.27	What deity is the Samit wood?
1.3.11.28	Which deity was the first oblation offered to?
1.3.11.29	Which deity was the Garhapatya fire looked at?
1.3.11.30	Which deity is the northern oblation?
1.3.11.31	Having offered to which deity, you thrice sprinkled the ladle towards the north?
1.3.11.32	Having placed the ladle on the sacrificial grass, having wiped it, you sprinkled the hands towards the north.
1.3.11.33	Having wiped the second (cup) dedicated to which deity, having put on the sacred thread for the Pitrs, having offered water to the Pitrs on the right side, you have offered water to the gods on the left side.
1.3.11.34	Which deity was the first one that you ate?
1.3.11.35	Which deity was second?
1.3.11.36	Which deity did you eat at the end?
1.3.11.37	Which deity is the water that you have poured into the ladle without washing it?
1.3.11.38	Which deity is the water that is sprinkled after washing?
1.3.11.39	Which deity is the water you poured from the ladle beyond the Āhavanīya fire?
1.3.11.40	Which deity are the ladle and the spoon that you have placed?
1.3.11.41	Which deity did you place the ladle handle at night?
1.3.11.42	Which deity do you place it in the morning?"
1.3.11.43	If you know this, O Gautama, then your offering is made; if you do not know, then your offering has not been made. Thus is the Brahmanical text.
1.3.12.1	He said, "The Rudra (offering) is made to the cow that is being milked.
1.3.12.2	The Manavya (offering) is to the cow that has been called.
1.3.12.3	The Vayu (offering) is when the cow is being approached.
1.3.12.4	The Vaisharadya (offering) when the calf is being taken away.
1.3.12.5	The Jagat (offering) when it has been taken away.
1.3.12.6	When the calf is being milked, the Ashvin (offering).
1.3.12.7	When the milk is milked, the Saumya (offering).
1.3.12.8-16	The Barhaspatya (graha) is being taken up. The Dyavaparthiva (graha) being taken up. The Agnieya (graha), being placed on the fire. The Vaishvanyariya (graha), placed on the fire, The Vaishnava (graha), is being kindled. The Maruta (graha), kindled, The Paushna (graha), has been boiled. The Varuna (graha), boiled, The Sarasvata (graha), brought back with water,
1.3.12.17-25	The Tvashtra-offering is being taken out. The Dhatri-offering has been taken out. Vaiśvadev is being taken up. Sāvitra has been taken up. Barhaspatya is being taken up (for offering). Dyāvāpṛthivya is being taken. Indra is being placed (for offering). The Indra-offering has been placed. The Indra-offering has come up. The Agni-offering has come. The Agni offering is being taken up.
1.3.12.26	The first oblation which I offered, that I placed in the heavenly world.
1.3.12.27	The Garhapatya which I looked at, for the continuity of this world.
1.3.12.28	The oblation to Prajapati is the last.
1.3.12.29	Therefore it is more than full by the mind.
1.3.12.30	Having offered, I thrice turned the ladle towards the north and offered it to Rudra.
1.3.12.31	Having placed the ladle on the sacrificial grass and having wiped it, I wiped my hands towards the north and invoked the herbs and trees.
1.3.12.32	Having wiped the second time and having tied the sacred thread for the father, I offered water to the fathers towards the south and invoked the fathers.
1.3.12.33	Having eaten the first food, I invoked the vital airs.
1.3.12.34	The second one is for the embryos.
1.3.12.35	Therefore, those who do not eat, the embryos live.
1.3.12.36	Whatever I ate at the end, with that I invoked all the gods.
1.3.12.37	Whatever water I poured from the unwashed ladle, with that I evoked the non-human beings.
1.3.12.38	Whatever I poured with the washed ladle, with that the human beings.
1.3.12.39	With the water that I poured out with the ladle beyond the Ahavaniya fire, I have invoked the Gandharvas and Apsarases.
1.3.12.40	With the ladle and the spoon that I heated, I have invoked (the sages) of the seven (heavenly) regions.
1.3.12.41	With the handle of the ladle that I put down at night, I have invoked those who dwell at night and belong to the right (side).
1.3.12.42	The Brāhmaṇa says, “Those who go to the south in the morning, they go to the south.”
1.3.13.1	“Indeed, it is so, as you say.”
1.3.13.2	“I ask you this.”
1.3.13.3	“Ask, O Pracinayoga!”
1.3.13.4	If all the fires have been brought together in the evening, they should be lit. The sacrificial vessels should be washed and placed. If the southern fire goes out, what danger would come from that?
1.3.13.5	His wife quickly dies if he offers without knowing.
1.3.13.6	I offer with knowledge alone."
1.3.13.7	What is your knowledge? What is your atonement?
1.3.13.8	Having taken the fire from the Gārhapatya to the Dakṣiṇāgni, having taken out the coals towards the east, one should offer with "Svāhā to Prāṇāpāna."
1.3.13.9	Then in the morning, having placed the fires in their proper places, one should offer as before.
1.3.13.10	That is my knowledge, that is my atonement."
1.3.13.11	If the Āhavanīya fire were to go out, what danger would come from that?
1.3.13.12	If one who does not know offers, his son quickly dies.
1.3.13.13	But I offer with knowledge alone."
1.3.13.14	"What is your knowledge? What is your atonement?"
1.3.13.15	Having taken the fire from the Garhapatya to the Ahavaniya, having taken out the embers towards the west, one should offer with the same kindling woods, saying "Svāhā."
1.3.13.16	Then in the morning, having placed the fires in their proper places, one should offer as before.
1.3.13.17	"That is my knowledge, that is the atonement."
1.3.13.18	And if the Garhapaty fire were to go out, or if danger were to come from it,
1.3.13.19	The householder who does not know this soon departs.
1.3.13.20	I offer with knowledge alone."
1.3.13.21	"What is your knowledge? What is your atonement?"
1.3.13.22	Having placed the fire of the Āhavanīya with ashes on the right side, having moved it to the right of the Dakṣiṇāgni, having placed it in the place of the Garhapatya, having then moved the Āhavanīyīya, having taken up the embers towards the north, one should offer with the formulas "Odanarūpa" and "Svāhā".
1.3.13.23	Then in the morning, having placed the fires in their respective places, one should offer as before.
1.3.13.24	That is my knowledge, that is my atonement."
1.3.13.25	"If all the fires were to go out, what danger would come from that?"
1.3.13.26	"The householder who offers without knowledge is quickly defeated by all the enemies.
1.3.13.27	But I offer with knowledge."
1.3.13.28	"What is your knowledge, what is your atonement?"
1.3.13.29	Having smeared the fire-places with a ball of cow-dung, having placed the Homa-material, having kindled the fire, one should offer oblations with the words "to Prāṇa and Apāna Svāhā", "to Samāna and Vyāna Svāhā" and "to Udāna and Rūpa Svāhā".
1.3.13.30	Then in the morning, having rekindled the fires in their respective places, one should offer as before.
1.3.13.31	That is my knowledge, that is the atonement.
1.3.13.32	And if they were not able to produce fire, and if the wind did not blow from anywhere, what danger would come from that?
1.3.13.33	For him whose knowledge is futile, his offering and oblation are futile.
1.3.13.34	But I offer with knowledge alone."
1.3.13.35	"What is your knowledge? What is your atonement?"
1.3.13.36	Having smeared the fire-places with a ball of cow-dung, having placed the Homa-material, one should offer oblation to oneself with the verse, "May the wind blow as a remedy."
1.3.13.37	Then in the morning, having kindled the fire and having placed the fires in their respective places, one should offer as before.
1.3.13.38	This is the Brahmanical text: "That is my knowledge, that is the atonement."
1.3.14.1	Thus, O Blessed One, as you have said.
1.3.14.2	I offer you this.
1.3.14.3	If you had not said this, your head would have fallen down."
1.3.14.4	"Well, I will tell you that so that your head does not fall down."
1.3.14.5	He who knows this and eats and drinks, his speech is satisfied.
1.3.14.6-10	When speech is satisfied, Agni is satisfied. When Agni is satisfied, the earth is satisfied. The beings that are connected with the earth are satisfied when the earth is satisfied.
1.3.14.11	When the wind is satisfied, the atmosphere is satisfied.
1.3.14.12	When the atmosphere is satisfied, the beings in the atmosphere are satisfied.
1.3.14.13	He who knows this and eats and drinks, his eyes are satisfied.
1.3.14.14	When his eyes are satisfied, the sun is satisfied.
1.3.14.15	 When the sun is satisfied, the sky is satisfied.
1.3.14.16	When the heaven is satisfied, the beings in heaven are satisfied.
1.3.14.17	He who knows this and eats and drinks, his mind is satisfied.
1.3.14.18	When the mind is satisfied, the moon is satisfied.
1.3.14.19	The waters are satisfied when the moon is satisfied.
1.3.14.20	When the waters are satisfied, the beings that are dependent on the waters are satisfied.
1.3.14.21	He who knows this and eats and drinks, his ear is satisfied.
1.3.14.22	When the ear is satisfied, the directions and sub-directions are satisfied.
1.3.14.23	And the beings in the directions and intermediate directions that are connected with them become satisfied.
1.3.14.24	He who, knowing this, eats and drinks, his right hand is the ladle.
1.3.14.25	The left hand is the Upabṛt.
1.3.14.26	The throat is the Dhruva.
1.3.14.27	Food is the oblation.
1.3.14.28	The vital airs are the lights.
1.3.14.29	He who knows this, and he who knowing this offers Agnihotra, has his Agnihotra always offered, always given, always eaten, always drunk. Thus says the Brāhmaṇa.
1.3.15.1	The Bharadvājas, the knowers of sacrifice, were called Priyamedhas.
1.3.15.2	They did not approach anyone who knew the Veda.
1.3.15.3	They knew everything.
1.3.15.4	They knew it all together.
1.3.15.5	They did not agree on the Agnihotra.
1.3.15.6	One of them offered the Agnihotra once, another twice, and another thrice.
1.3.15.7	Those who offered the Agnihotra twice and thrice asked the one who offered it once, "To whom do you offer?"
1.3.15.8	"This entire universe is indeed one."
1.3.15.9	"I offer to Prajapati in the evening," he said. "To Prajapati in morning."
1.3.15.10	Those who offered twice asked him, "To whom do you offer?"
1.3.15.11	"To Agni and Prajapati in evening," he said, "to Surya and Prajapati, in morning."
1.3.15.12	Of those who offered three times, the one who offered three times was asked by the others, "To whom do you offer?" He said, "To Agni, Prajapati, and Anumati." In the evening, to Surya, Prajapati and Agni, and in the morning to Agni, Svishtakrit.
1.3.15.13	Of those who offered twice, the one who did so was successful.
1.3.15.14	He became the most prosperous.
1.3.15.15	He surpassed the other two by his progeny and by his glory.
1.3.15.16	His progeny became equal to the progeny of the other two.
1.3.15.17	Therefore, one should offer twice, both with the Yajus and with the mind.
1.3.15.18	He who knows this and offers Agnihotra knowing this, attains the prosperity that he attained.
1.3.16.1	Where did Svāhā originate?
1.3.16.2	By whom was she created?
1.3.16.3	What is her clan?
1.3.16.4	How many syllables does she have?
1.3.16.5	How many feet?
1.3.16.6	How many letters?
1.3.16.7	What is the beginning and end?
1.3.16.8	Where is she located?
1.3.16.9	What is she based on?
1.3.16.10	Please tell me about Svāhā's deity and form.
1.3.16.11	Svāhā originated from truth.
1.3.16.12	She was created by Brahma.
1.3.16.13	Her clan is Lāmagāyana.
1.3.16.14	Two syllables.
1.3.16.15	One word.
1.3.16.16	Three letters: white, lotus, and gold.
1.3.16.17	All the Vedas have a single exhalation, which is a summary of all the meters, and the four Vedas are at the end of the letters.
1.3.16.18	The six limbs, herbs, trees, and hair.
1.3.16.19	The eyes are the sun and the moon.
1.3.16.20	She is Svāhā, she is Svādha, she is used as Vasat in sacrifices.
1.3.16.21	Her deity is Agni.
1.3.16.22	Brahman is the form. Thus it is Brahman.
1.3.17.1	And also the sages named Kārāvas had little wealth.
1.3.17.2	They saw this one-fold Agniṣṭoma.
1.3.17.3	They brought it.
1.3.17.4	They performed it.
1.3.17.5	They went to heaven.
1.3.17.6	Now, he who desires to go to heaven should offer this single-streamed Agniṣṭoma sacrifice. This is the Brahmanical statement.
1.3.18.1	Now, we shall explain the division of the animal to be offered in the Savaniya sacrifice.
1.3.18.2	The jaws with the tongue are for the Prastôtṛ.
1.3.18.3	The throat with the windpipe is for the Pratihartṛ.
1.3.18.4	The breast with the wings is for the Udgātṛ.
1.3.18.5	The right shoulder is the Adhvaryu's.
1.3.18.6	The left shoulder is the Udgātṛs'.
1.3.18.7	The left shoulder belongs to the Pratiprasthātṛ.
1.3.18.8	The right hip belongs to the Brahman.
1.3.18.9	The lower thigh belongs to the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin.
1.3.18.10	The thigh belongs to the Potṛ.
1.3.18.11	The left hip belongs to the Hotṛ.
1.3.18.12	The lower left thigh belongs to the Maitrāvaruṇa.
1.3.18.13	The knee belongs to the Acchāvāka.
1.3.18.14	The right arm is for the Hotṛ.
1.3.18.15	The left arm is for the Sadasya.
1.3.18.16	The right and left arms are for the householder.
1.3.18.17	The thigh is for the wife.
1.3.18.18	She gives it to the Brāhmaṇa.
1.3.18.19	The heart, kidneys, fingers, right arm are for the Agnidh.
1.3.18.20	The left is for the Ātreya.
1.3.18.21	The right feet of the householder who gives the vow.
1.3.18.22	The left feet of the housewife who gives the vow,
1.3.18.23	Together with their lips.
1.3.18.24	The householder alone takes them.
1.3.18.25	The three kinds of stones, the three kinds of bones, and the three kinds of flesh,
1.3.18.26	And the three kinds of stones and half of the flesh of the one who raises them,
1.3.18.27	Now, the Adhvaryu of the Camas follows.
1.3.18.28	The head of the one who pacifies.
1.3.18.29	The head belongs to Subrahmanya.
1.3.18.30	The skin belongs to the one who invites for the next day's Soma offering.
1.3.18.31	Thus, they become thirty-six.
1.3.18.32	Thirty-six portions are taken from the cow.
1.3.18.33	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
1.3.18.34	The heaven world is related to the Brihatī.
1.3.18.35	The gods of the Brihatī sacrifice in the heavenly world.
1.3.18.36	They stand firm in the heavenly world through the Brihatī.
1.3.18.37	Those who distribute thus stand firm with offspring and cattle.
1.3.18.38	But if those who are otherwise disposed, or who have committed sins, or who have not offered oblations, or who are foreigners, should disturb it, then their cattle will be disturbed and will not lead to heaven.
1.3.18.39	The divine-share-possessing sage Śruta, having known the division of the animal,
1.3.18.40	taught it to Girija Babhravya, who then taught it to other humans.
1.3.18.41	Thus it came to be among humans in the later times. This is the Brāhmaṇa.
1.3.19.1	Now, then, about consecration.
1.3.19.2	Why is one called consecrated?
1.3.19.3	Because one attains the supreme intellect.
1.3.19.4	They call him who is initiated a "Dīkṣita" by indirect means.
1.3.19.5	For the gods are fond of indirectness and hate directness.
1.3.19.6	Why is the initiated one not to rise up or greet?
1.3.19.7-11	Those who rise up and greet him, they are possessed by him, the Atharva-Angirasas. What is his Atharvan? What is his Angiras? What is the Atharvan of those who offer to themselves and not to others? Thus, the Atharvanas offer to themselves and do not offer to others. What is the Angiras of those who offer?
1.3.19.12	When one does not take the names of oneself and others, then the names of oneself as well as others are not taken.
1.3.19.13	They speak words that are discerning and truthful.
1.3.19.14	They discern the Brahman and follow the Prajapati.
1.3.19.15	This is the cow of the vow of Atharva-Angirasa.
1.3.19.16	For they are connected with it.
1.3.19.17	For what reason is one who has been initiated not to be spoken to? His name is not to be uttered.
1.3.19.18	They say, "He is in the food, he is in the name." Those who eat his food eat his sin.
1.3.19.19	And those who utter his name remove his sin.
1.3.19.20	But they say that he is the embryo of the Vedas.
1.3.19.21	They say that for him who is not born, not known, and whose Soma is not bought, it is not to be drunk.
1.3.19.22	They say, "He is born in the morning of the consecrations, they buy Soma for him who is born, known, and whose soma is bought, it is to be drunk."
1.3.19.23	For what reason do they desire to exclude those who are related?
1.3.19.24	The one who is more energetic wins the sacrifice of the other.
1.3.19.25	Why is it said, 'One should not meditate on the divine when it is established, nor should one study?'
1.3.19.26	It is for the sake of creation.
1.3.19.27	When lightning flashes and thunder roars, and then it rains, the gods consecrate the wind and consume Soma.
1.3.19.28	The Brahmanas, who are attentive and obedient, drink it.
1.3.19.29	They are the fathers and grandfathers of those who eat all tastes.
1.3.19.30	He should not think about the gods when they are settled, and should not study. This is said in the Brahmana.
1.3.20.1	The teachers returned and sat down.
1.3.20.2	The sacrifice, assuming the form of a Brahmana, approached them as they were about to be initiated.
1.3.20.3	If you all agree, I will initiate you in the middle."
1.3.20.4	They said, "We do not know you, we do not recognize you."
1.3.20.5	"Who will be initiated with someone who is unknown?"
1.3.20.6	"If you are going to be initiated, you will not be initiated again.
1.3.20.7	Or, if you are going to initiate like this, you will be deluded then.
1.3.20.8	Your sacrifice will deceive you. All of you will be initiated."
1.3.20.9	Or else, one of you will be the one to be initiated. You will become householders with priests who are not deficient in their duties.
1.3.20.10	They sat there, thinking silently.
1.3.20.11	He said, "Why are you sitting silently?
1.3.20.12	We ask you again.
1.3.20.13	"They ask: 'What is this? You will be initiated, but you will not be able to practice the union in this year.'
1.3.20.14	They say: 'Fie!'
1.3.20.15	'How can we practice without being initiated?'
1.3.20.16	You will be the most beloved of the Brahmanas.
1.3.20.17	The semen of those Brahmanas who will be in this year will be yours. You will be the ones who will attain enlightenment.
1.3.20.18	Or, we will approach or we will not approach.
1.3.20.19	They will be the ones to be initiated and scattered.
1.3.20.20	The path to the gods will not appear.
1.3.20.21	The path of the gods will be hidden.
1.3.20.22	We therefore approach the Blessed One himself, so that we may attain the goal of the year in safety." This is the Brahmanical text.
1.3.21.1	He said, "Twelve kinds of wealth indeed depart from one who is consecrated.
1.3.21.2	One who is consecrated should not offer the Agnihotra.
1.3.21.3	One should not perform a sacrifice with the Full Moon offering.
1.3.21.4	Nor with the New Moon offering.
1.3.21.5	One should dwell in this.
1.3.21.6-14	One should not perform the Pitr-yajna. One should not go to a place where one wishes to go with the mind. One should perform the Iṣṭi. One should speak with the voice as one pleases. One should avoid sexual intercourse. One should use food as one pleases. One should not perform a sacrifice with animal sacrifice. One should go to a place which one sees with the eyes. One should wear a black antelope skin.
1.3.21.15	He should hold a kuśa-grass.
1.3.21.16	He should make a fist.
1.3.21.17	The three fingers beginning with the thumb should be raised.
1.3.21.18	He should take a deer-horn.
1.3.21.19	He should scratch with it.
1.3.21.20	Now, if the speech of an initiated person becomes loose or the fist is released, he should recite these (mantras):
1.3.22.1	May Agnihotra and the Full-moon sacrifice, having become the two bestowers of desires, have entered the earth.
1.3.22.2	May Vasati and the New-moon sacrifice, being in the rear and facing east, be the same as before.
1.3.22.3	May the mind and the Pitryajna sacrifice, being in front and facing south, be the same.
1.3.22.4	Speech and the offering are on the north, the southern direction. Both are equal.
1.3.22.5	Semen and food are above, both are equal.
1.3.22.6	The eye and the animal sacrifice are the sacrifice, the two, having become the desire-granting tree and the earth, have entered together. Indeed, the initiated one who places wealth in himself does not have any distress, and does not approach the obstruction of the sacrifice. He destroys death again and again.
1.3.22.7	He goes beyond death and attains immortality.
1.3.22.8	He who knows this shines in all worlds. He who, knowing this, approaches initiation, is a brahmin.
1.3.23.1	Now, if the wife of a consecrated person becomes pregnant, then having cooked a potful of rice in the milk of a cow that has a calf of the same colour, having poured it, having taken it out, having recited the Abhihiṅkāra, having sprinkled it with the Garbhāvedana and Puṃsavana mantras, he should eat it.
1.3.23.2	Semen is food.
1.3.23.3	The bull is the sound of Hiṅkāra.
1.3.23.4	Thus, the initiated wife of an initiated lord gives birth to a son.
1.3.23.5	By this very procedure, one should offer sacrifices. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.4.1.1	"Oṃ, this indeed is the sacrifice, which blows here."
1.4.1.2	Those who initiate themselves for the year aspire for it.
1.4.1.3	Among them, the householder initiates first.
1.4.1.4	This world is the householder.
1.4.1.5	Everything in this world is established on this.
1.4.1.6	All the sacrificers are indeed established on the householder.
1.4.1.7	They are initiated for the sake of establishment.
1.4.2.1	Then he initiates the Brahman, the moon being the divine Brahman, the mind being the inner Brahman.
1.4.2.2	He establishes the plants with the mind.
1.4.2.3	He who knows the plants, he alone knows the plants of Brahman. He unites them with this world.
1.4.2.4	Therefore, no one should be initiated between these two.
1.4.2.5	If anyone is initiated between these two, he would destroy this world with the plants.
1.4.2.6	They would become dry.
1.4.2.7	Therefore, one should not be initiated between these.
1.4.3.1	Then he consecrates the Udgātṛ.
1.4.3.2	The Udgātṛ is indeed Aditya, the deity, and the eye, the inner self.
1.4.3.3	Parjanya is Aditya.
1.4.3.4	From Parjanya comes rain.
1.4.3.5	Rain indeed brings together the plants.
1.4.3.6	Therefore, none should be consecrated between these two.
1.4.3.7	If anyone were to be initiated between these two, he would destroy this world in a year.
1.4.3.8	There would be no rain.
1.4.3.9	Therefore, no one should be initiated between these.
1.4.4.1	Then he initiates the Hotṛ.
1.4.4.2	Agni is the Hotṛ among the gods, speech is the inner self.
1.4.4.3	Rain is food.
1.4.4.4	He thus unites speech and Agni with food.
1.4.5.3	Food is rain.
1.4.5.4	He unites the wind and the breath with food.
1.4.5.5	Therefore, no one should be initiated between these two.
1.4.5.6	If someone were to be initiated between these, he would destroy this world with the breath.
1.4.5.7	They would be short-lived.
1.4.5.8	Therefore, none should be initiated between them.
1.4.6.1	Then he consecrates the Brahman to the Brahman-priest.
1.4.6.2	Then he consecrates the Udgâtri to the Prastôtâ.
1.4.6.3	Then he consigrates the Hotri to the Maitrâvaruna.
1.4.6.4	Then he (the Adhvaryu) consecrates the Adhvaryu to the Pratiprasthâtri, and the Nestr to the Adhvaryus.
1.4.6.5	He follows them.
1.4.6.6	The other (priests) follow the consecration of these nine (priests).
1.4.6.7	Nine are the vital airs.
1.4.6.8	The sacrifice is sustained by the vital airs.
1.4.6.9	Then he consecrates the Pot-bearer for Brahman.
1.4.6.10	Then he consigrates the Reciter for the Udgâtri.
1.4.6.11	Then he consecrates the Acchavahâka for the Hotri.
1.4.6.12	Then the Unnetr consecrates the Neshtar for the Adhvaryu.
1.4.6.13	He follows him.
1.4.6.14	Then he conscrates the Agnidhra for Brahman.
1.4.6.15	Then he consecrates the Udgâtri priest with the Subrahmaṇya rite.
1.4.6.16	Then he consecrates the Hotri priest with the Gravastut rite.
1.4.6.17	Then another, either a bath-graduate or a student, consecrates him.
1.4.6.18	They say that one who is pure should not purify (another).
1.4.6.19	This is the gradual consecration.
1.4.6.20	Those who are thus consecrated, they do not find the expiation for the Sattrins.
1.4.6.21	The expiation for the sacrificers is as prescribed. The half of the sacrifice is the means of livelihood for those in whose half the consecration takes place. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.4.7.1	The gods, desiring to consecrate themselves, thought of Sraddha. They thought of Aditi for the Pravargya.
1.4.7.2	They thought of Soma for the purchase.
1.4.7.3	They thought Vishnu for the Atithyas.
1.4.7.4	They thought Aditya for the Pravargya.
1.4.7.5	They thought Svadha for the Upasads.
1.4.7.6	To Agni and Soma, the Upavasatha day.
1.4.7.7	To the gods of the morning-pressing, the morning-hymn.
1.4.7.8	To the Vasus, the morning-pressing.
1.4.7.9	To the Rudras, the midday-pressing.
1.4.7.10	The third pressing to the Adityas.
1.4.7.11	To Varuna, the Avabhrtha.
1.4.7.12	To Aditi, the Udayaniya.
1.4.7.13	To Mitra and Varuna, the Anubandhya.
1.4.7.14	For Tvashtri, the son of Tvashtri.
1.4.7.15	For the goddesses, the daughters of the gods, the oblations for the gods.
1.4.7.16	Out of desire, the Dasatira-atra.
1.4.7.17	From heaven, the Udasiniya.
1.4.7.18	That indeed is the birth of the Agniṣṭoma.
1.4.7.19	He who knows this birth of the Agnișṭoma, having become endowed with the Agniṣṭomayajña, attains the world of the gods. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.4.8.1	Then, when they perform the Diksaniya sacrifice, they worship the goddess of faith.
1.4.8.2	They become the goddess of faith, the deity.
1.4.8.3	Those who perform this (sacrifice) attain union with the goddess of faith and attain her world.
1.4.8.4	Then, when they perform (the sacrifice) called Prayaniya, they worship the Aditi goddess.
1.4.8.5	The Goddess Aditi is the deity.
1.4.8.6	Those who perform this rite attain union with the Goddess Aditi and her world.
1.4.8.7	And when they perform the purchase rite, they worship the divine Soma as the deity.
1.4.8.8	Soma is the divine deity.
1.4.8.9	Those performing this rite attain union and the world of the divine Soma.
1.4.8.10	Then, when they perform the Atithyas, they worship that god Vishnu as the deity.
1.4.8.11	They become the god Vishnu as the deities.
1.4.8.12	Those who perform this attain union with the god Vishnu and attain his world.
1.4.8.13	Then, when they perform Pravargya, they worship the god Aditya as the deity.
1.4.8.14	The sun-god is the deity.
1.4.8.15	Those who perform this attain union with the sun-god and his world.
1.4.8.16	And when they perform the Upasads, they worship the goddess of nourishment as the deity.
1.4.8.17	The goddess of nourishment is the deity. The goddess of nourishment is their deity.
1.4.8.18	Those performing this attain union with and the world of the goddess of nourishment.
1.4.8.19	Now, when they perform the rites on the Upavasatha day, they worship Agni and Soma as the deities.
1.4.8.20	They become Agni and Soma as deities.
1.4.8.21	Those who perform this (rite) attain union with Agni and Soma as their deities, and attain the same world.
1.4.8.22	Now when they perform the morning recitation, they worship the gods of the morning recitation.
1.4.8.23	The gods of the morning are the deities.
1.4.8.24	Those who perform this (recitation) attain union and world of the gods of the gods of morning recitation.
1.4.8.25	Now when they perform the forenoon pressing, they worship the Vasus.
1.4.8.26	The Vasus are the deities.
1.4.8.27	They go to the world of the Vasus, the gods, those who offer this.
1.4.8.28	Then when they offer the midday pressing, they worship the Rudras as the deities.
1.4.8.29	The Rudras are the deities. The Rudras are the gods, the deities.
1.4.8.30	Those who offer this go to the world, the union with the Rudras, the gods.
1.4.8.31	Now when they perform the third pressing, they worship the gods, the Ādityas, as the deity.
1.4.8.32	The Ādityas are the gods, the deity.
1.4.8.33	Those who perform this (pressing) go to the world of the Ādityan gods, to their union.
1.4.8.34	Now when they perform the Avabhrtha (pressing), they worship the god Varuna as the deity.
1.4.8.35	Varuna is the deity.
1.4.8.36	They go to the world of the deity Varuna, the god, those who perform this (sacrifice).
1.4.8.37	And when they perform with the Udayaniya (Satra), then they perform with the goddess Aditi as the deity.
1.4.8.38	Aditi is the deity. The goddess Aditi is the deity (of this sacrifice).
1.4.8.39	They go to union and world of the goddess Aditi, those who perform it.
1.4.8.40	Now when they sacrifice with the Anūbandhya (oblation), they sacrifice to Mitra and Varuna as the deities.
1.4.8.41	They become Mitra and Varuna, the deities.
1.4.8.42	Those who perform this (sacrifice) go to the world of Mitra and Varuna.
1.4.8.43	When they sacrifice with the animal dedicated to Tvashtri, they sacrifice to Tvashtra as the deity.

1.4.8.45	Those who perform this (sacrifice) go to the world of Tvaṣṭr, the deity, and attain union with him.
1.4.8.46	And when they perform with the offerings to the goddesses, those which are at the Upasads, Agni, Soma, and Viṣṇu are the goddesses, the offerings to the gods.
1.4.8.47	Those who perform this sacrifice attain union with the goddesses, the divine maidens, and the deities.
1.4.8.48	Then, when they perform the Dasha Atiratra sacrifice, they worship the god of desire as the deity.
1.4.8.49	The god of desire becomes the deity.
1.4.8.50	Those who perform this sacrifice go to union with the god of desire and attain the same world as him.
1.4.8.51	Now, when they perform the Upavasatha sacrifice, they worship heaven, the world, the god, the deity.
1.4.8.52	Heaven, the world, and the god become the deity.
1.4.8.53	Those who perform this (sacrifice) attain union with heaven, the world and the god, and attain the same world.
1.4.8.54	This is indeed the birth of the Agniṣṭoma.
1.4.8.55	He who knows the origin of the Agniṣṭoma thus, attains the Agniṣṭomaitic sacrifice and stands firm in the heavenly world.
1.4.8.56	He who knows this stands firm in progeny and cattle.
1.4.8.57	One who has the Agniṣṭom becomes one with the Self and the world and goes to the gods. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.4.9.1	The gods created the Prāyaṇīya Atiratra with the day and night.
1.4.9.2	From the half-months, the twenty-fourth day.
1.4.9.3	From Brahma, the Abhipava.
1.4.9.4	From the Kshatriya, the Prishthya.
1.4.9.5	From Agni, the Abhijit.
1.4.9.6	From the waters, the Svarasama.

1.4.9.8	The Svarasamas have been mentioned in reverse order.
1.4.9.9	From Indra, the Vishvajit.
1.4.9.10	The Prishthya and Abhipava have been mentioned.
1.4.9.11	To Mitra and Varuna, the Gavayus.
1.4.9.12	To all the gods, the Dasaraatra.
1.4.9.13	To the directions, the Dasaraatrikas, the six-day Prsthya.
1.4.9.14	To these worlds, the three-day Chandoma.
1.4.9.15	From the Samvatsara, the tenth day.
1.4.9.16	From Prajapati, the Mahavrata.
1.4.9.17	From heaven, the Udayaniya Atiratra.
1.4.9.18	That indeed is the birth of the year.
1.4.9.19	He who knows thus the birth of the Year, becomes one with the Self and the World of the Year and goes to the Gods. So says the Brahmana.
1.4.10.1	Now when they perform the Prayaniya Atiratra, they worship the two Gods, Day and Night.
1.4.10.2	Day and Night become the two Gods.
1.4.10.3	Those who perform this sacrifice attain union with the gods of day and night and their world.
1.4.10.4	Then, when they perform the twenty-fourth day, they worship the gods of the half-months as their deities.
1.4.10.5	The half-months are the gods, the deities.

1.4.10.15	Those who perform this sacrifice go to union with the god Agn and attain the same worlds as him.
1.4.10.16	Then, when they perform the Svārasāmna sacrifice, they worship the goddesses as the deities.
1.4.10.17	The goddesses become the deities of the waters.
1.4.10.18	Those who perform this sacrifice attain union with the goddesses of the waters and their world.
1.4.10.19	Then, when they perform at the equinox, they worship the sun as the deity.
1.4.10.20	The sun becomes the deity of the gods.
1.4.10.21	Those who perform this attain union with the Sun-god and attain his world.
1.4.10.22	The Svarasaman hymns have been recited in reverse order.
1.4.10.23	Now, when they perform the Vishvajita sacrifice, they worship Indra, the god, as the deity.
1.4.10.24	They become Indra, the god and the deity.
1.4.10.25	Those who perform this attain Indra, the god's union and attain his world.
1.4.10.26	The Prsthya and the Abhipaga are mentioned.
1.4.10.27	Now, when they offer the Gavayus, they worship Mitra and Varuna as the deities.
1.4.10.28	They become Mitra and Varuna, the deities.
1.4.10.29	Those who offer this attain union with Mitra and Varuna and their world.
1.4.10.30	Now when they perform the ten-night (rite), then they worship the Viśve Devas as the deities.
1.4.10.31	The Viśve Devatas become the deities.
1.4.10.32	Those who perform this (rite) go to the world of the Viśve Devās, to their union.
1.4.10.33	Now when they perform the six-day Prsthya rite lasting for twelve nights, then they worship the goddesses of the directions as the deities.
1.4.10.34	The goddesses of the directions are the deities.
1.4.10.35	Those who perform this (sacrifice) go to the world of the goddesses of the directions.
1.4.10.36	Now, when they perform the three-day Chāndogya sacrifice, they worship these very worlds and gods as deities.
1.4.10.37	These worlds and gods are the deities.
1.4.10.38-41	Those who perform this sacrifice attain the world of the gods, the union with the gods. Then when they perform the tenth day, they worship the god Samvatsara as the deity. They become the god Samvatsaras as the deity. They attain the world of Samvatsara, the union with Samvatsara, those who perform this sacrifice.
1.4.10.42	Then when they perform the Mahāvrata rite, they worship the deity Prajapati as the deity.
1.4.10.43	They become the deity Prajapatı.
1.4.10.44	Those who perform this rite attain union with the deity Prajapāti and attain the same world as him.
1.4.10.45	Then when they perform the Udayaniya Atiratra rite, they worship heaven as the deity.
1.4.10.46	Heaven, the world, the god, the deity are (all) this.
1.4.10.47	Those who attain this attain union with heaven, the world, and the god.
1.4.10.48	This indeed is the birth of the year.
1.4.10.49	He who knows this birth of the year attains that year and abides in heaven, the world.
1.4.10.50	He who thus knows this abides in offspring and cattle.
1.4.10.51	He who knows this becomes endowed with self and with the world and goes to the gods. Thus says the Brāhmaṇa.
1.4.11.1	This very year is established in the divine and in the individual.
1.4.11.2	He who knows this year established in the divine as well as in the individual, he indeed stands firm.
1.4.11.3	He who thus knows this stands firm in progeny and cattle.
1.4.12.1-7	That indeed is the year, completed in the Brihatī (metre). Two verses are the two six-day (satra) sessions, two are the Pratiṣṭhī and Aplavana (satra). The Gavāmayana is a ten-night (satra). Thus indeed, thirty-six (verses) are completed. Thirty-six are the portions of the cow. Thirty-seven are the verses of the Brihatī. The heavenly world is indeed based on the Brihatī.
1.4.12.8	The gods perform the sacrifice in heaven with the Brihatī.
1.4.12.9	One who knows this stands firm in heaven.
1.4.12.10	One who thus knows stands firm with offspring and cattle.
1.4.13.1	This is indeed the year with three great vows.
1.4.13.2	The great vow is on the twenty-fourth day, the great vow is at the equinox, the great vow itself is the great vow.
1.4.13.3	Now those who knew this used to perform the Trimahāvratas in the past.
1.4.13.4	They were luminous, truthful, and of firm vows.
1.4.13.5	Those who perform it today as they did in the past, just as water poured into an unfit vessel would perish, so would the sacrificers perish. They perform it above.
1.4.13.6	Thus, indeed, he conquers by truth, austerity and vow, he who knows thus.
1.4.14.1	Now, when one approaches the twenty-fourth day, having approached and approached the equinoctial day, one approaches the Great Vrata. How does one become free from doubt?
1.4.14.2	One should say that it is the same Atiratra which they perform before the equinoctials.
1.4.14.3	The Prishthya is created from the Abhiplva.
1.4.14.4	From the Prishthya, the Abhijit.
1.4.14.5	From the Abhijit, the Svarasama.
1.4.14.6	From the Svarasama, the Visuva.
1.4.14.7	From the Visuva, the Svarasamas.
1.4.14.8	From the svarasamas, the Vishvajita.
1.4.14.9	From the Vishvajita, the Prishthyas and Abhiplvas.
1.4.14.10	From the Prishtyas and Abhiplva, the Gavayushi.
1.4.14.11	From the Gavayushi, the Dasahara.
1.4.14.12	The Mahavrata lasts for ten nights.
1.4.14.13	After the Mahavrata, the Udayaniya Atiratra.
1.4.14.14	The Udayaniya Ati-ratra is for heaven, for the world, for food, for stability.
1.4.15.1	Now, if one were to approach the twenty-fourth day, approaching and not approaching the equinox, and approach the Mahavrata - how does it become without error?
1.4.15.2-9	He who is the Atiratra before the Visuvat should be mentioned. The Abhijit is formed from the Abhiplva. The Svarasama is formed from the Abhijiti. The Visuva is formed from the Svarasama. The Svarasa is formed from the Visuva. The Visvajit is formed from Svarasa. The Abhiplva and the Prishthya are formed from the Visvajit.
1.4.15.10	The Gavayus are chanted on the Prsthya and Abhiplava.
1.4.15.11	The Gavayus are sung on the Dasaraatra.
1.4.15.12	Then indeed the Mahaavrata did not stand for the gods. How did they come to the Visuvat with upward Stomas, with the Avrittas?
1.4.15.13	The gods were here as if they were not.
1.4.15.14	We know that sacrifice, the rite of the higher Stoma, by which we may attain this day."
1.4.15.15	They saw this twelve-night rite of the higher stoma.
1.4.15.16	They brought it.
1.4.15.17	They performed it.
1.4.15.18	Then they stood up from it.
1.4.15.19	The Great Vrata stands for him.
1.4.15.20	It stands firm.
1.4.15.21	He who knows this stands firm with progeny and cattle.
1.4.16.1	Now, if one were to approach the twenty-fourth day, approaching and approaching the midday of the equinox, and then approach the Great Vrata, how would it be without transgression?
1.4.16.2	One should say that it is by that very Atiratra which they approach before the equinox.
1.4.16.3	They say, how many days of the year are the reverse and how many are the forward?
1.4.16.4	Those which are taken up once only are the reverse.
1.4.16.5	Those which are again and again taken up are the forward. One should worship them as such.
1.4.16.6	For the repetition of the six-day rites, they follow the repetition.
1.4.17.1	Now, if one were to approach the twenty-fourth day, approaching and not approaching, the Mahāvrata at the Viṣuva, how would it be for non-transgression?
1.4.17.2	One should say, "It is the same as the Atiratra before the Viṣuva."
1.4.17.3	They approach the Abhiplva before the Viṣuvat in the east.
1.4.17.4	The Pratiṣṭha above.
1.4.17.5-9	The father is the Abhijit, the son is the Pratijit. Therefore in the earlier stage of life the sons support the father. They perform the Pratijit after the Visuvat, the Abhijit before it. The father is the Abhijt, the son is Pratijit. Therefore in the later stage of life the father supports the sons. He who knows this.
1.4.17.10	This is also said in a verse: "The gods have made a hundred autumns for us, where our bodies will not age, where we will be sons and our fathers will be fathers. May we not die in the middle of our lives."
1.4.17.11	Those who know this, in the earlier stage of life, the sons live for the father, and in the later stage of life, he lives for the sons.
1.4.18.1	Now, indeed, this is the great Suparna.
1.4.18.2	The six months that he approaches before the equinox are his right wing.
1.4.18.3	And the six that he approaches after having turned above are his left wing.
1.4.18.4	The equinox is the self of the year, the wings are the limbs.
1.4.18.5	Where there is the self, there are the wings.
1.4.18.6	Where there are the wings, there is the self.
1.4.18.7	The Self does not exceed the two fortnights.
1.4.18.8	The two fortnights do not exceed the Self.
1.4.18.9	Thus, indeed, one should say that the other fortnights are the other fortnights.
1.4.19.1	They say, "The year consists of twelve months, and we shall attain that day."
1.4.19.2-6	The one who is the equal of the others is the great one of the others. One should say, "The others and the others." The self is the equinox of the year, and the months are the limbs. Where there is the self, there are the limbs. Where there are the limbs, there is the self.
1.4.19.7	The self does not exceed the limbs, nor do the limbs exceed the self.
1.4.19.8	Thus, indeed, one should say that the self is the same as the other days and the other days are the same as the self.
1.4.19.9	That indeed is the year.
1.4.20.1	They say, how is it that the two-light-courses are the Abhiplvas and the one-light-course is the Pratiṣṭha?
1.4.20.2	These worlds are the two-light courses, Agni is the leader, and the sun is the follower.
1.4.20.3	This indeed is the light of these (worlds), which shines like a firebrand.
1.4.20.4	In the two-light course and the Pratiṣhṭha, which is the wheel of the gods, they remove sin and move around.
1.4.20.5-9	Now, if one were to proclaim the sin of those who know thus and are initiated, then they would cut off his head in the assembly of gods. He performed the Uddhi sacrifice for ten nights. He performed Uddhi for ten nights and the Prishthya and Abhipaga sacrifices. He said, "One should perform the rites." One should alternate the praises and hymns.
1.4.20.10-15	He who would cause them to be transferred, from him these vital airs in the man are different. One vital air would dwell in the body, if he would not cause them to be trans- ferred, the sacrificer would be short-lived. He indeed is short-lived who is blind or deaf. Nine Agniṣṭomas are accomplished in a month. Nine indeed are the vital airs. The sacrifice is supported by the vital airs. The Utkhyas are twenty-one.
1.4.20.16	One Ukthya, one Sodashi.
1.4.20.17	Ukthya is food.
1.4.20.18	Sodashi is energy.
1.4.20.19	Having thus ascended, they ascend to the heavenly world.
1.4.21.1	Now, then, the ascent of the days.
1.4.21.2	They ascend the Udayaniya Atiratra with the Prayaniya Atiratra, the Mahavrata with the Caturvimsa,
1.4.21.3	the Paramaratris with the Abhiplva.
1.4.21.4	The Prsthya (Sāman) is the highest of the Prsthya.
1.4.21.5	The Abhijit (Sāman), the highest of the Abhijit, with the Svarasāmans, the highest of the Svarasāmas.
1.4.21.6	"Now this day is the one which we shall attain." If one says, "This is the one which is the last of the others and the first of the others," one should say, "It is the last of others and the first also of others."
1.4.21.7	This indeed is the year.
1.4.22.1	Now the arrangement of the days.
1.4.22.2	The Pravargya and the Atiratra are performed on the twenty-fourth day.
1.4.22.3	The twenty-fourth day is for the Abhiplva.
1.4.22.4	The Abhiplva is for the Prishthya.
1.4.22.5	The Prishthya is for the Abhijit.
1.4.22.6	The Abhijit is for the Svarasama.
1.4.22.7	The Svarasama is for the Visuva.
1.4.22.8	The Visuva is for the Svarasa.
1.4.22.9	The Svarasa is for the Vishvajit.
1.4.22.10	The Viśvajit is performed in the Prsthya and Aplavya Sāmans.
1.4.22.11	The Prsthyaand Aplavya Sāmans are performed in the Gavāmayana and Ayus Sāmans.
1.4.22.12	The Gavāmayanaand Ayus Sāmns are performed in the Dasara tra.
1.4.22.13	The Dasara tra is performed in the Mahāvrata.
1.4.22.14	The Mahāvrata is performed in the Udayanīya Atiratra.
1.4.22.15	The Udayanīyātiratra is performed for heaven, food, and stability.
1.4.23.1	The Adityas and the Angirasas were competing for the heavenly world, saying, "We shall go to heaven first, we shall go to heaven before you."
1.4.23.2	The Adityas, with four light Sāmans and two Prsthas, ascended to the heavenly world.
1.4.23.3	Because they ascended, therefore it is called Abhiplava.
1.4.23.4	The Angirases, following the teachers, touched the heavenly world with all the Stomas and all the Prsthas.
1.4.23.5	Because they touched it, therefore it is called Spṛśya.
1.4.23.6	They call this Spṛśya indirectly by the name Prstha.
1.4.23.7	The gods are fond of the indirect and hate the direct.
1.4.23.8	The Prishthya is created from the Abhiplva.
1.4.23.9	From the Prishthya, the Abhijit.
1.4.23.10	From the Abhijit, the Svarasama.
1.4.23.11	From the Svarasama, the Visuva.
1.4.23.12	From the Visuva, the Svarasamas.
1.4.23.13	From the svarasamas, the Vishvajita.
1.4.23.14	From the Vishvajita, the Prishthyas and Abhiplvas.
1.4.23.15	From the Prishtyas and Abhiplva, the Gavayushi.
1.4.23.16	From the Gavayushi, the Dasahara.
1.4.23.17	These are the places of sacrifice, the places of sacrificial activity.
1.4.23.18	There are a hundred chariots in each of them. They are like the forests, having climbed into them, they wander about, afflicted by hunger and thirst, wandering in sin.
1.4.23.19	Those who perform the sacrifice without knowing this, wander in the same way.
1.4.23.20	Now those who know this, they go from one stream to another, from one dry land to another, from the high to the low, from the happy to the happy, from the fearless to the fearless. Thus indeed, we have attained the end of the year." So said the Brahmanas.
1.4.24.1	Predi, the son of Kauśambī, the son of Kousurubindu, lived the life of a student under Udālaka Āruṇi.
1.4.24.2	The teacher asked him, "O young one, how many days does your father think are in a year?"
1.4.24.3	"How many are there?"
1.4.24.4	He said, "Ten."
1.4.24.5	"Ten indeed," he said.
1.4.24.6	The Viraj has ten syllables, and the sacrifice is Viraj.
1.4.24.7	"How many?"
1.4.24.8	He said "Nine."
1.4.24.9	"Nine indeed," he said,
1.4.24.10	There are nine breaths.
1.4.24.11	The sacrifice is supported by the breaths.
1.4.24.12-24	How many are they? He said, "Eight." He said, "Eight." The Gayatri has eight syllables. The sacrifice is the Gayatri. How many are they? He said, "Seven." He said "Seven." There are seven metres. The sacrifice prospers with the metres. How many? He said, "Six." He said, 'Six.'
1.4.24.25	There are six seasons.
1.4.24.26	For the attainment of the seasons.
1.4.24.27	How many are they?
1.4.24.28	He said five.
1.4.24.29	He said five indeed.
1.4.24.30	The Pankti has five feet.
1.4.24.31	The sacrifice is fivefold.
1.4.24.32	How many indeed are they?
1.4.24.33	Four, he said.
1.4.24.34	He said four indeed.
1.4.24.35	There are four Vedas.
1.4.24.36	The sacrifice prospers with the Vedas.
1.4.24.37	How many?
1.4.24.38	He said, "Three."
1.4.24.39	He said, "Three indeed."
1.4.24.40	The sacrifice is three-fold.
1.4.24.41	The sacrifice is extended by the Savanas.
1.4.24.42	How many are they?
1.4.24.43	He said, Two.
1.4.24.44	He said, 'Two indeed.'
1.4.24.45	Man has two feet.
1.4.24.46	Man has two foundations.
1.4.24.47	Man is the sacrifice.
1.4.24.48	How many is it?
1.4.24.49	He said One.
1.4.24.50	He said 'One indeed.'
1.4.24.51	Every day, thus the whole year.
1.5.1.1	Om! The Abhiplva is a six-day period.
1.5.1.2	There are six days: Jyoti, Gau, Ayus, Gau, Ayas, Jyoti.
1.5.1.3	The Abhiplva is five days.
1.5.1.4	There are indeed five days.
1.5.1.5	Whatever was the first day, that was the last day.
1.5.1.6	The Abhiplava is four days.
1.5.1.7-13	There are four Stotras: Trivrit, Pañcadaśa, Saptadaśa and Ekavimśa. The Abhipava is a three-day sacrifice. It has three repetitions, light, cow and life. The Abhiplava is a two-day sacrifice. There are two Sāman chants, namely Brihat and Rathantara. The Abhilava is a one-day sacrifice. It is performed with the Stotras of one day.
1.5.1.14	The four Ukthyas have twelve Stotras in excess.
1.5.1.15	This is the seventh Agnistoma.
1.5.1.16	Thus indeed, the seven Agnistoma sacrifices are completed in a month. This is the Brahmanical statement.
1.5.2.1	Now, then, about the establishment of the Gadha.
1.5.2.2	Those who are initiated for a year cross the ocean.
1.5.2.3	The Prayaniya Atiratra is indeed the ford for them.
1.5.2.4	They cross over by means of a ford.
1.5.2.5	Just as they would cross over the ocean by means of a ferry, so is it.
1.5.2.6	The ford is the twenty-fourth day, which is deep enough to reach the armpits or the neck, from where one can rest and bathe. So is it.
1.5.2.7	Abhiplava is the ford.
1.5.2.8	Prsthya is the ford.
1.5.2.9	The depth of the water should be such that one can stand in it, or such that one can reach the water up to the elbows or the neck, and then bathe.
1.5.2.10	The first one is the length of the water up to one's navel.
1.5.2.11	The second one is the length up to one' knees.
1.5.2.12	The third one is the length upto one's ankles.
1.5.2.13	The island of Pratiṣṭhāna is as much as the water reaches the armpits or the neck.
1.5.2.14	The first one is as much as it reaches the ankles.
1.5.2.15	The second one is as much it reaches the knees.
1.5.2.16	The third one is as much is it reaches the waist.
1.5.2.17	The depth of the water should be such that one can stand in it, or such that one can reach the water with the elbow, or such that the water reaches the neck.
1.5.2.18	The Prāsnāya is a Prsthya sacrifice, the Prāsnāya an Abhipaga sacrifice, the Prāsnaya a Gavāmayana sacrifice, the Präsnaya a Dasaraatra sacrifice.
1.5.2.19	The Gadha is the foundation, the Mahavrata is the height, it is as high as the armpit or the neck, from where they can rest and bathe. That is how it is.
1.5.2.20	The Udayaniya Atiratra is the sacred place for them.
1.5.2.21	For they rise up with the sacred place.
1.5.2.22	Just as they would rise up with the ocean as their sacred place, that is how it is.
1.5.2.23	Then indeed Śvetaketu Āruṇeya said, "I shall be initiated for a year."
1.5.2.24	His father, looking at his face, said, "Do you know the depth and foundation of the year?"
1.5.2.25	He said, "I know."
1.5.2.26	He said this knowing it. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.5.3.1	The year is indeed a person.
1.5.3.2	His feet are the Prayaniya Atiratra.
1.5.3.3	For it is by means of the feet that one goes forth. The white part of them is the form of the day,
1.5.3.4	and the black part is the form of night.
1.5.3.5	The nails are the form of the stars.
1.5.3.6	The hairs are the form of plants and trees.
1.5.3.7	The thighs are the twenty-four days.
1.5.3.8	The chest is the Abhiplva.
1.5.3.9	The back is the Prishthya.
1.5.3.10	The head is indeed three-fold, for the head is indeed three fold. The skin, the bone, the marrow, the brain.
1.5.3.11	The neck is fifteen-fold, for there are indeed fourteen joints in it.
1.5.3.12	The virility is fifteen-fold.
1.5.3.13	Therefore, with these slender and strong ones, one carries a heavy load.
1.5.3.14	Therefore, the neck is fifteen-folds.
1.5.3.15	The chest is the seventeenth.
1.5.3.16	The eight other (parts) are the sides, the eight others are the ribs, the chest is the seventeenth (part).
1.5.3.17	Therefore the chest is the seventeen.
1.5.3.18	The belly is the twenty-first.
1.5.3.19	For there are twenty-one (parts) inside the belly, the belly is the twenty first.
1.5.3.20	Therefore the belly is the twentieth.
1.5.3.21	The sides are the twenty-ninth.
1.5.3.22-27	The thirteen ribs are the thirteen on the side. Therefore, the side is thirty-nine. The back is thirty-three. For there are thirty-two back-bones and two vertebrae. The back, thirty-three. Therefore, the back is thirty-two.
1.5.3.28	His right arm is the Abhijit.
1.5.3.29	His three right breaths are the Svarasamaņas.
1.5.3.30	The self is the Visuva.

1.5.3.35	The ten days are the Angas.
1.5.3.36	The Mahavrata is the mouth.
1.5.3.37	The Udayaniya Atiratra is the two hands.
1.5.3.38	For the hands are the rising.
1.5.4.1	The man is indeed the year.
1.5.4.2	His breath is the Prayaniya Atiratra.
1.5.4.3	For they go forth by breath.
1.5.4.4	The speech is the Aarambhaniya day.
1.5.4.5	Whatever is undertaken, it is undertaken by speech.
1.5.4.6	He begins with speech itself.
1.5.4.7	His right hand is the Abhiplava.
1.5.4.8	This is his morning pressing, this is his midday pressing, this is the third pressing.
1.5.4.9	In the abode of the Gayatri.
1.5.4.10	Therefore this is his shortest.
1.5.4.11	This is its morning pressing, this its midday pressing, this its third pressing.
1.5.4.12	In the abode of the Tristubh.
1.5.4.13	Therefore this is the best of them.
1.5.4.14	This is his morning pressing, this is the midday pressing, this is his evening pressing.
1.5.4.15	In the abode of the Jagati.
1.5.4.16	Therefore this one is the best of these two.
1.5.4.17	This is its morning pressing, this its midday pressing, this its evening pressing.
1.5.4.18	in the abode of the Pankti.
1.5.4.19	The Pāṅkti is like the earth.
1.5.4.20	Therefore this is the most extensive of them.
1.5.4.21	This is its morning pressing, this its midday pressing, this its third pressing.
1.5.4.22	In the abode of Viraj.
1.5.4.23	Food is prosperity.
1.5.4.24	Viraj is food.
1.5.4.25	For the attainment of food and prosperity.
1.5.4.26	Therefore this one is the most excellent of them.
1.5.4.27	This is his morning pressing, this is his midday pressing, this is the third pressing.
1.5.4.28	The Atichandas is the abode of the Chandasas.
1.5.4.29	The Ati chandas is the abode of all the Chandasas;
1.5.4.30	Therefore this is the most extensive slab.
1.5.4.31	This is his morning pressing; this is his midday press- ing; this is the third press- ing.
1.5.4.32	This is the Abhiplva; this is the Atma-paryaya.
1.5.4.33	It seems to float like the Abhiplava.
1.5.4.34	It seems to stand like the Pratiṣṭha.
1.5.4.35	For it floats with its limbs,
1.5.4.36	and stands with its self.
1.5.4.37	The right ear of that (animal) is the Abhijit.
1.5.4.38	The white part of the right eye is the first Svara-sāman.
1.5.4.39	The black part is the second.
1.5.4.40	The circle is the third.
1.5.4.41	The nose is the first, the circle of the sun, the Sama of the downward-moving breath.
1.5.4.42	What is black is the second.
1.5.4.43	What is white is the third.
1.5.4.44	This is his left ear, the Vishvajita.
1.5.4.45	The Prsthya and Aplavya have been mentioned.
1.5.4.46	The two breaths, the Prāṇas, are the Gavayushi.
1.5.4.47	The limbs are the Dasaraatra.
1.5.4.48	The face is the Mahavrata.
1.5.5.9	There are three kinds of breath in man.
1.5.5.10	Here it is equal.
1.5.5.11	There are six seasons in a year.
1.5.5.12	There are these six kinds of breath in a man.
1.5.5.13	Here they are equal.
1.5.5.14	There seven seasons in a year
1.5.5.15	There are these seven kinds of breath in the man.
1.5.5.16	Here are they equal.
1.5.5.17	There twelve months in a year. There are these twelve kinds of breath in
1.5.5.18	the man.
1.5.5.19	Here it is equal to that.
1.5.5.20	Thirteen months are of the year.
1.5.5.21	These thirteen are the vital airs in man.
1.5.5.22	Here it is equal to this.
1.5.5.23	Twenty-four fortnights are of the year,
1.5.5.24	This man is twenty-four.
1.5.5.25	He has twenty fingers and four limbs.
1.5.5.26	Here it becomes equal to this. 
1.5.5.27	Twenty-six fortnights are of a year,
1.5.5.28	This is the twenty-sixth person.
1.5.5.29	The twenty-sixth is established.
1.5.5.30	Here it is equal to that.
1.5.5.31	And indeed there are three hundred and sixty days and nights in a year.
1.5.5.32	So many are the breaths of a man.
1.5.5.33	Here it equals that.
1.5.5.34	And there are indeed seven hundred and twenty days and nights in the year.
1.5.5.35	There are so many bones and marrow in a man.
1.5.5.36	Here it is equal to that.
1.5.5.37	There are fourteen hundred and forty days and nights in a year.
1.5.5.38	There are so many hard muscles in a man. Here it is equal to
1.5.5.39	that.
1.5.5.40-45	And there are twenty-eight hundred and eighty days and nights in a year. So many are the breaths of a man. Here it is equal. And there are ten thousand and eight hundred Muhurtas in a year. So many are the muscles of a man. Here it is equal.
1.5.5.46	As many as the fifteen Muhurtas, so many are the Pranas.
1.5.5.47	As many as the Pranas, so many the Apanas.
1.5.5.48	As many the Apanas, so many the Vyanas.
1.5.5.49	As the Vyanas, so many are Samanas.
1.5.5.50	As are the Samanas, so many Udanas.
1.5.5.51	As many as the Udanas, fifteen times, so many are these.
1.5.5.52	As many as these, so many are the Etarhis.
1.5.5.53	As many are the Etarhī, so many are now the Swetayānas.
1.5.5.54	As many Swetayānas, so many are Kshiprāyanas.
1.5.5.55	As many Kshiprāyamas, so many are hair follicles.
1.5.5.56	As many as the pores of the body, multiplied by fifteen, are the number of streams of water.
1.5.5.57	This is the extent of a Krośa.
1.5.5.58	This is also said in a verse: "He who moves from one place to another, walking or sitting or even sleeping, in a moment, how many times does he breathe in and out in a day and night? In a hundred years, there are eight hundred and a hundred times the number of hours that are said to be a day and night. How many times does a person breathe in and out during that time?" This is the Brahmana.
1.5.6.1	Vasu said, "The equality of the year should be known."
1.5.6.2	They offer one Atiratra before the equinox and one after it.
1.5.6.3	They offer three hundred and fifty Agniṣṭomas before the equinox and three hundred and fifty after it.
1.5.6.4	They perform twenty hundred Utkhya sacrifices before the Visuvat and twenty hundred after it.
1.5.6.5	They perform six Sodashin sacrifices before the Visuvata and six after it.
1.5.6.6	Thirty six-day sacrifices are performed before the Visuvati and thirty after it.
1.5.6.7	This is the equality of the year.
1.5.6.8	He who knows this equality of the year, becomes equal to the year, and goes to the gods. Thus says the Brāhmaṇa.
1.5.7.1	Now, then, the sequence of sacrifices.
1.5.7.2	The laying of the fire.
1.5.7.3	From the laying of the fire, the full oblation.
1.5.7.4	From the full oblation, the Agnihotra.
1.5.7.5	From the Agnihotra, the New and Full Moon sacrifices.
1.5.7.6	From the New and Full-Moon sacrifices, the Āgrayaṇa.
1.5.7.7	From the Āgrayaṇas, the Cāturmāsya sacrifices.
1.5.7.8	From the Cāturmāsyas, the Pāśubandha sacrifice.
1.5.7.9	From the Pāśu-bandha, the Agniṣṭoma.
1.5.7.10	From the Agniṣṭomah, the Rājasūya.
1.5.7.11	From the Rājasuya, the Vājapeya.
1.5.7.12	From Vājapeya, the Aśvamedha.
1.5.7.13	From the Aśvameḍha, the Puruṣamedha.
1.5.7.14	Purusa-medha, the Sarva-medha.
1.5.7.15	From Sarva-medhā, the Dakṣiṇāvant.
1.5.7.16	Those who give gifts to the right are not those who give gifts.
1.5.7.17	Those who do not give gifts stand in the place of those who give a thousand gifts.
1.5.7.18	These indeed are the stages of the sacrifice.
1.5.7.19	He who knows these stages of the sacrifice becomes one with the sacrifice, one with the Self, one with the world, and goes to the gods. Thus says the Brāhmaṇa.
1.5.8.1	Prajapati desired, "May I attain immortality."
1.5.8.2	Having kindled the fires, he performed the Full-offering.
1.5.8.3	He saw the end.
1.5.8.4	Having performed the Agnihotra, he saw the end. 
1.5.8.5	Having performed the New and Full Moon sacrifices, he saw the End.
1.5.8.6	Having performed with the Aggrayan, he saw the END.
1.5.8.7	Having performed at the Catu-r-ma-sya, he saw the EN
1.5.8.8	He saw the end by performing the Pashu-bandha sacrifice.
1.5.8.9	He saw the end by offering the Agni-stomas.
1.5.8.10	He performed the Rajasuya sacrifice and took the name of a king.
1.5.8.11	He saw an end.
1.5.8.12	He performed Vajapeya and took the name Samraat.
1.5.8.13	He saw a limit.
1.5.8.14	He performed Ashvamedha and took the name Svarat.
1.5.8.15-20	He saw the end. Having performed the Purushamedha sacrifice, he named himself Viraj. He saw the end. Having performed the Sarvamedha sacrifice, he called himself Sarvaraj. He saw an end. Having offered sacrifices with the prescribed Dakshina, he saw an end.
1.5.8.21	He saw the end by sacrificing with the Ahīna and Adakṣiṇāvaḍa sacrifices.
1.5.8.22	He sacrificed with the Sattra, the Ubhayatotītrātra and the Anta.
1.5.8.23	He gave speech to the Hotṛ, breath to the Adhvaryu, sight to the Udgātṛ, mind to the Brahman, the limbs to the Hotrkas, and the self to the Sadasyas.
1.5.8.24	Thus having given the endlessness of the self, one attains the endlessness.
1.5.8.25	Whatever Dakshina was brought, with that one should redeem oneself.
1.5.8.26	Therefore, one should hasten with this Jyotishtoma, Agnishtoma, self-redemption, with a thousand Dakshina, and with the Prsthashmananiya.
1.5.8.27	He who goes without having performed the Prsthya sacrifice, goes without having bought himself. So says the Brāhmaṇa.
1.5.9.1	Now, when they initiate for the year and the year-long sacrifice, how is their Agnihotra uninterrupted?
1.5.9.2	One should say: By vow.
1.5.9.3	How is their Darsa uninterrupted?
1.5.9.4	One says: By curds and cake.
1.5.9.5	How do these (sacrifices) become uninterrupted by the Full Moon sacrifice?
1.5.9.6	One should say, "With ghee and rice-cake."
1.5.9.7	How do these (sacrificial sessions) become uninterrupted by Agrayan?
1.5.9.8	One should state, "With Soma-rice."
1.5.9.9	How do the four seasonal sacrifices become uninterrupted?
1.5.9.10	One should declare, "With milk."
1.5.9.11	How is the animal sacrifice of these (sacrifices) not interrupted?
1.5.9.12	One should say, "With the animal and the sacrificial cake."
1.5.9.13	How is the Soma sacrifice of these (sacrifices) not interrupted ?
1.5.9.14	One should say "With the planets."
1.5.9.15	How is domestic sacrifice of these ( sacrifices ) not interrupted ?
1.5.9.16	 One should say "With cooked rice and sour gruel."
1.5.9.17	How is the Pitryajña of these (sacrifices) not interrupted?
1.5.9.18	One should say: "By the Upavasana."
1.5.9.19	How is the union of these not interrupted?
1.5.9.20	"One should say: By the Hinkara."
1.5.9.21	This is the end of the year for the sacrifices.
1.5.9.22	He who knows thus the end of the year of the sacrificial rites, he, having become identical with the sacrifice, and having the same world, goes to the gods. Thus says the Brāhmaṇa.
1.5.10.1	The gods initiated themselves for the thousand-year-long sacrifice.
1.5.10.2	When five hundred years were over, then all this became silent, namely, the Stotras, the Prsthas, and the Sastras.
1.5.10.3-5	Those gods, knowing that sacrifice, which is the measure of a thousand years, said, "Who among men would sacrifice with a thousand years?" They saw that the middle of the sacrifice was not enough.
1.5.10.6	The Vedic verse which was not there before, they saw in the five (Vedic texts) - in the Ṛgveda, Yajurveda, Sāmaveda, Śānti and Ghora.
1.5.10.7	These five Vyāhṛtis are Oṃ, Śrāvaya, Śrauṣad, Yaj, Yajāmahe, and Vauṣaḍ.
1.5.10.8	Those gods who were here, they knew that sacrificial rite which is the image of the thousand-year sacrifice.
1.5.10.9	Who is that man who would sacrifice for a thousand years?
1.5.10.10	Then they saw this Tapasci-rite as the substitute for the thousand-year-long sacrifice.
1.5.10.11	These are the Stotras, these are the Prsthas, these are the Sastras.
1.5.10.12	He goes through the consecration for twelve months, the Upasads for twelve months, and the Sutyas for twelve months.
1.5.10.13	Now, when he goes through the consecratory rites for twelve months and the preparatory rites for twelve months, thereby he attains the Agni and Arka.
1.5.10.14	And when he goes through twelve months of Soma-offerings, thereby he attains this great eulogy.
1.5.10.15	Those gods who are here, they know that sacrificial rite which is the image of the thousand-year-long (sacrifice).
1.5.10.16	Who is that man who would sacrifice for a thousand years?
1.5.10.17	Then they saw this year of Tapasci in the Anjasya.
1.5.10.18	They are the same Stotras, the same Prsthas, the same Sastras.
1.5.10.19	Those gods, knowing that we are here, know that sacrifice which is the image of the thousand-year sacrifice.
1.5.10.20	Who would be able to sacrifice for a thousand years?
1.5.10.21	Then they saw this twelve-day (rite) as the year's completion.
1.5.10.22	They are indeed the stomas, the pṛṣṭhas, and the śastras.
1.5.10.23	He indeed goes to the twelve-day consecration, the twelve-day Upavasatha, and the twelve-day Sutyas.
1.5.10.24	Now, when he proceeds for twelve days with consecratory rites and twelve days with preparatory rites, thereby he attains the two fires and the sun.
1.5.10.25	And when he proceeds for the twelve days of the Soma-feasts, thereby he attains this great eulogy.
1.5.10.26	Those gods who are here, they know that sacrificial rite which is the image of the thousand-year-long (sacrifice).
1.5.10.27	Who would sacrifice for him who sacrifices for a thousand years?
1.5.10.28	Then they saw this six-day Prsthya as the supplement to the twelve-day (sacrifice).
1.5.10.29	They are indeed the Stomas, the Prsthas, and the Sastras.
1.5.10.30	Those gods who know that sacrificial rite which is the image of the thousand-year (sacrifice),
1.5.10.31	Who would sacrifice to him who sacrifices every thousand years?
1.5.10.32	Then they saw this Vishvajita as the Anjasi of the six-day Prsthya.
1.5.10.33	They are indeed the Stotras, the Prsthas, and the Sastras.
1.5.10.34	Those gods who know that sacrificial rite which is the image of the thousand-year sacrifice.
1.5.10.35	Who is that man who would sacrifice for a thousand years?
1.5.10.36	He indeed is the conqueror of all, who is the image of the thousand-year sacrifice.
1.5.10.37	He indeed is Prajapati of creatures, who is the conqueror of everything. This is the Brahmanical text.
1.5.11.1	Prajapati said to Narayana, the man, "Sacrifice, sacrifice."
1.5.11.2	He said, "Sacrifice and sacrifice." Thus you are telling me.
1.5.11.3	The Vasus have thrice pressed me at the morning pressing, the Rudras at the midday pressing, and the Adityas at the third pressing.
1.5.11.4	The Vasus came to the sacrificial ground at the morning pressing, the Rudras at the midday pressing, and the Adityas at the third pressing. They were satisfied at the sacrificial ground, and they were satisfied with the sacrificial ground. Those who know this, they are indeed the ones who should sacrifice to you.
1.5.11.5	These indeed are ignorant, where the Hotṛ is ignorant of the Rg, the Adhvaryu is ignorant of the Yajus, the Udgātṛ is ignorant of Sāman, and the Brahman is ignorant of the Bhṛgūṅgiras.
1.5.11.6	"Do sacrifice, but I will tell you that."
1.5.11.7	"Just as a gem is on a thread, so are these Utkhahana days; or as a thread is on a gem."
1.5.11.8	Therefore, he who knows everything should be made Brahma.
1.5.11.9	He who knows everything, he is indeed Brahma, who knows Bhrigu and Angiras.
1.5.11.10	They are indeed the pacifiers and protectors of this entire universe.
1.5.11.11	Therefore, Brahma recites in the Bahispavamana hymn.
1.5.12.1	You are the hawk, the Gāyatrī metre, I am following you. May you lead me to safety.
1.5.12.2	When he says, 'You are the hawk', he is indeed saying, 'You are Soma'.
1.5.12.3	For this indeed is Agni, having become (Soma), he moves about in this world.
1.5.12.4	And because he moves about, he is a hawk.
1.5.12.5	That is the hawk-ness of the hawk.
1.5.12.6	When he says, "I am taking up the Gayatri metre," he takes up Agni present in this world at the morning pressing with the Gayatri metre and the Vasus.
1.5.12.7	When he says, "May I be protected with welfare," he is protected with welfare by Agni, the deity of the morning pressing, in this world, with the Gayatri metre and the Vasus, the deities. He who knows this is protected with welfare in this world by Agni, the god of the morning pressing with the Gayatri meter and the Vasus.
1.5.13.1	Then at the Madhyamdina Pavamāna, he recites: "You are the king, the Tristubh metre, I follow you, may you protect me with welfare."
1.5.13.2	When he says "You are the King", he is indeed saying "Soma".
1.5.13.3	This indeed is Vayu, having become the king in the world of the atmosphere.
1.5.13.4	And because he rules, he is the king.
1.5.13.5	This is the kingly rule.
1.5.13.6	When he says, "The Tristubh metre is yours, I am following you," he follows the wind existing in the atmosphere-world with the Tristubh metre and the Rudras at the midday pressing.
1.5.13.7	When he says, "May I be protected by you," he is protected by the wind, the god, with the Tristubb metre and the Rudra gods at the midday pressing.
1.5.13.8	By the Tristubh metre, by the Rudras, at the midday pressing, he attains prosperity in the world of the atmosphere, with the wind as the deity, he who knows thus.
1.5.14.1	Then he recites the Arbhava Pavamana: "You are the voice, you are the song, the Jagat metre follows you. May I be prosperous and protected."
1.5.14.2	When he says, "You are the Voice," he means Soma.
1.5.14.3	He indeed, having become the sun, shines in the other world.
1.5.14.4	Because he shines, therefore he is called Svarah.
1.5.14.5	That is the nature of Svarah.
1.5.14.6	When he says, "You are Gayah," he means Soma.
1.5.14.7	He indeed, having become Moon, goes to all worlds.
1.5.14.8	Because he goes, therefore he is Gayah.
1.5.14.9	That indeed is the nature of Gayah.
1.5.14.10	When he says, "I am following the Jagat metre," he follows the Sun, present in the world of heaven, with the Jagat metre and the Aditya gods at the third pressing.
1.5.14.11	When he says, "May I be protected by the Svastis," he does so with the Jāgata metre, with the Aditya deities, at the third pressing, in the world beyond, with the Sun-god. "May I be saved by the Svasti" he does so with Jāgata metre and Aditya deities, at third pressing, in world beyond, with Sun-god. He who knows thus is saved by the Svasti.
1.5.15.1	Then, when the Savana is over, he recites: "May there be splendour in me, may there be greatness in me, may fame be in me, may everything be in me."
1.5.15.2	Earth itself is splendour, sky itself is greatness, heaven itself is fame, water itself is everything.
1.5.15.3	Fire itself is splendour, wind itself is greatness, sun itself is fame, moon itself is everything.
1.5.15.4	Vasus are indeed splendour, Rudras are indeed greatness, Adityas are indeed fame, the All-gods are indeed everything.
1.5.15.5	Gâyatrî is indeed splendour, Trishtup is indeed greatness, Jagatî is indeed fame, Anushtup is indeed everything.
1.5.15.6	The eastern direction is indeed splendour, the western direction is indeed greatness, the northern direction is indeed fame, the southern direction is indeed everything.
1.5.15.7	Spring is the radiance, Summer is the greatness, Autumn is the fame, and Winter is the whole.
1.5.15.8	Spring is the radiance, Autumn is the greatness, Winter is the fame, Summer is the whole. The Trivṛt (Sāman) is the radiance, the Pañcadaśa (Sāman), the greatness, the Saptadaśa (Saman), the fame, the Ekavimśa (Sūman), the whole.
1.5.15.9	The Rgveda is the radiance, Yajurveda is the greatness, Sāmaveda is the fame, Atharvaveda is the whole.
1.5.15.10	Hotr is indeed the splendour, Adhvaryu is indeed the greatness, Udgātṛ is indeed the fame, Brahman is indeed everything.
1.5.15.11	Speech is indeed the splendour; breath is indeed the greatness; sight is indeed the fame; mind is indeed everything.
1.5.16.1	When he says, "May Bhṛgu be in me," he means the earth, the worlds, Agni, the gods, the Vasus, the groups of gods, the Gāyatrī metre, the eastern direction, the spring season, the Trivṛt stoma, the Ṛgveda, the Hotr, the Hotr priests, speech, the senses.
1.5.17.1	When he says, 'In me is the great one', he means the sky, the worlds, the wind, the Rudras, the gods, the groups of gods, the Tristubh metre, the western direction, the summer season, the fifteen Stoma, the Yajurveda, the Adhvaryu, the Pratihartri, the breath, the senses.
1.5.18.1	When he says, "May there be fame in me," he means heaven, the world of gods, the sun, the group of gods, the Jātavedas hymn, the northern direction, the autumn season, the seventeenfold Stoma, the Sāmaveda, the Udgātṛ, the eye, the sense of sight.
1.5.19.1	He who says, "All is in me," he says that the waters are of the worlds, the moon of the gods, the All-gods of the groups of gods, the Anushtubh of the metres, the southern direction of the directions, the autumn of the seasons, the twenty-one of the Stomas, the Brahmaveda of the Vedas, the Brahmanhood of the Hotrkas, the mind of the senses.
1.5.20.1	He indeed becomes tenfold and fourfold.
1.5.20.2	And there are ten syllables in the four Viraj.
1.5.20.3	The embryos live on it.
1.5.20.4	Virat is indeed prosperity.
1.5.20.5	Fame is food.
1.5.20.6	He thus establishes prosperity, fame, and food on Viraj.
1.5.20.7	All this stands firm following it.
1.5.20.8	He who knows this stands firm with offspring and cattle.
1.5.21.1	Anirvan, the divine Angiras, approached and said, "We shall partake of the remnants of the sacrifice."
1.5.21.2	Angiras said, "He whose sacrifice is not lost knows the seventeenfold Prajapati in the sacrifice.
1.5.21.3	No one can harm his sacrifice or the lord of the sacrifice."
1.5.21.4	These are the five Vyāhṛtis: Oṃ, śrāvaya, śrauṣad, yaj, ye yajāmahe, vauṣad.
1.5.21.5	Dadhyanṅaṅgiras said, "We do not know if we are Brahmins, if we are not Brahmins, if they are of that sage or of another."
1.5.21.6	The Anarvanas and the Ritavas, the Fathers, have come together in the Svāhā. We shall speak, we shall speak.'
1.5.21.7	He went (to them) and said, 'O Ritavas, the Self-existent ones have gone. We shall not speak.'
1.5.21.8	Therefore, when one is about to go on a journey, one should recite, 'The gods, the Fathers,' three times.
1.5.22.4	They should have the same Adhvaryu.
1.5.22.5	Having placed the fires in the Ukhā-sambharaniyā, they should offer with that.
1.5.22.6	They should have different Adhvaryus until the Diksaniyā.
1.5.22.7	Having placed their fires in the Diksaniyá, they should offer.
1.5.22.8	They should again have the same Advaryu until the Udavasaniyā.
1.5.22.9	Having placed the fires on the Upavasatha day, they should offer sacrifice with that.
1.5.22.10	They should be of different Adhvaryus.
1.5.22.11	If the sacrificer were to fall ill, having placed the fires on either side, he should stay there until he is cured.
1.5.22.12	If he were to die, they should cremate him with his own fires.
1.5.22.13	Others say that the sacrificers should stay with their own fires.
1.5.22.14	That is the Brahmanical fee for him, which is given before the morning Savana.
1.5.22.15	The blessings of the Pitrimedha have been explained.
1.5.23.1	The evening and morning oblations, the Sthalipaka, the new grain, the Bali, the Pitryajna, the Ashtka, and the Psu are the Pakiyajnas.
1.5.23.2	The Agni-adhyaya, the Agnihotra, the Full-moon and New-moon sacrifices, the Nava-sthi, the Catu-r-masya, and the Pasu-bandha are the seven Havi-ryajnas.
1.5.23.3	The Agnishtoma, the Ati-agnishtoma, the Ukthya, the Shodashi, the Vajapeya, the Ati-ratra, and the Apto-ryama are the seven Sutyas.
1.5.23.4	Who are the gods who are the most eloquent, who are the gods who have the most power, who are the most sacrificial gods? What is the most desirable thing that is connected with pleasure?
1.5.23.5	The seasons are the most eloquent gods, the months are the gods who possess the most power, the half-months are the most sacrificial, and that is the most desirable that is connected with the pleasure.
1.5.23.6	How many nights, how many days, how many praises, how many hymns, how many Savanas, how many Stotriya verses, how many syllables are there in the year?
1.5.23.7	Two Atiratras, six hundred Agniṣṭomas, two hundred and twenty Ukthyas, twelve Ṣoḍaśins, sixty Ṣaḍhas, and the Vaisuvata.
1.5.23.8	His days are twenty-one hundred, and one day more. So many are the Savanas of his year. A thousand, eighty-three, are the praises of him who is praised.
1.5.23.9	Sixty-six and two hundred are the praises and hymns. His Stotriyas are ten thousand, ninety thousand, and two lakhs, ninety-six.
1.5.23.10	The number of syllables in this year, as calculated by the sages, is 390,000,00,080. This is the middle measure of the year, according to the gods.
1.5.23.11	One hundred and twenty-one thousand, thirty-two crores, and eight hundred and ninety syllables are the number of syllables in the year, as calculated according to the Prajapatis.
1.5.23.12	The first Vasat-call, ending with the offering, is well-performed in the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice, in the form of a festival. The Sāma-chant is the Sviṣṭakṛt, which is desired by one who wishes for good health. The Agnihotra is offered many times in four hundred ways.
1.5.23.13	The morning pressing is praised with twenty-one verses in the Gāyatrī metre. The midday pressing is performed with seventeen verses, and the third pressing with thirty-three verses.
1.5.24.1	In Sraddhā, the ascetic Vaishvānara, desiring offspring, sprinkled his semen through Tapas. Then was born Lokajit, the son of Soma, the son of Angiras, the son of Rishi.
1.5.24.2	The one who, by means of the four kinds of sacrifice of the sage, conquered this world of the good, to whom the Vedas flow together with drops of Soma, carrying him to the world of the good.
1.5.24.3	The Rk verses carry his four parts, rejoicing in praise and hymns, rejoicing in the Grahas, oblations, and what is done and not done. The Yajus verses carry his four portions.
1.5.24.4	The Sāman is chanted in the Udumbara (Sāman) with praises and Stotras. The Sāmans carry the four parts with the Chanda, with the Gīti and with the Prāstāra.
1.5.24.5	The Atharva-Angirasas, the healers, the purifiers, the calm ones, praise with expiations. Brahma, delighted with his own nature, delights in the four distinct shares that he carries.
1.5.24.6	May he who knows Brahman be auspicious to you. May the wise and steadfast one protect this Dharma. May you not be negligent of the immortal sacrifice and the rites by which the non-Angiras became.
1.5.24.7	May the ten Maruts, the Maruts with Indra, the Maruts, the lords of the Maruts, protect us. May the Maruts, with Indra, the lords of Maruts, protect me. May the Marut hosts, with Indra, protect me.
1.5.24.8	The Hotṛ, the Maitrāvaruṇa, the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, and the Gravastut, each chanting a verse, offer praise to Agni on earth, each day, with the support of Brahman.
1.5.24.9	The Adhvaryu, the Pratiprasthātṛ, the Nestr, the Unnetr, the Brahman, the Udgātṛ, the Pratihartr, the Subrahmaṇya, the Prastôtṛ, the Udgâtri, the Pratihartṛ, the Subrahmanya, the Prastôtr, the Udgâtṛ, the Pratihârtṛ, the Subrahaṇya, the Prâstôtṛ, and the Udgâtṝ, all of them, having placed one foot on the ground, praise the space with the Yajus, and support the wind with the Brahman.
1.5.24.10	The Udgâtri who covers (the space), who is attentive, who is the giver of the Stobha in the Udumbara (tree), who is stammering, the Prastötṛ who is learned, and the Subrahmaṇa who is the Pratihâtr at the sacrifice, all of them.
1.5.24.11	The Brahmanas, praising the Sun, hold one foot of the Sun, which is deposited in the heaven. The Brahmanas hold one foot of Brahma, which is deposited by the Hotri and Agnidhra.
1.5.24.12	Then the Atharva and Angirasa (sages) protect the moon in the waters, the Brahmanas support it with the sixteen verses, the Hotrakas praise it, the Vedas are connected with it, and it is divided into four parts.
1.5.24.13-14	The wise, initiated, believing, officiating priests, the guardians, carry the sacrifice. The one who recites this formula, "The people of the Brahmanical assembly are on the right side," is the seventeenth member. They praise him as the one who knows the past. The eighteenth is the initiated one among the initiated ones. The wife is engaged in the sacrifice. She is believing.
1.5.24.15	The nineteenth was Śamita, the twentieth was Yajña, the householder himself, the twenty-first was indeed the establishment of them, O Angiras.
1.5.24.16	The world praised by the Vedas, unconquered by various forms,
1.5.25.1	The seven Sutyas, the seven Pakayajnas, the seven Haviryajnas, and the twenty-one; all these sacrifices flow into Angiras. The new ones that the Rishis create, and those created earlier by the ancients,
1.5.25.2	In these Vedas, they collect only one for the priests to perform the Apvarga. The Kriti (verse) follows the Tripadi (triad). It is the Ashtin (verse) that is spread out among the creatures.
1.5.25.3	The Dakshina (gifts) being taken away return. The Soma-pressing is extended. The Yajna-tantra (ritual) is spread out. Those who go without blessings return not. Those who perform the Yajna without the desired (results) do not cross the worlds.
1.5.25.4	The twelve years of celibacy is prescribed separately in the Vedas. Thus, all the Vedas are established in their own duties.
1.5.25.5	There are common mantras, rituals, and Brahmanas in them. But all that arrangement is prescribed separately in each Veda.
1.5.25.6	The Rg Veda has the earth as its abode, the Adhvara has the sky as its abode, and the heaven is the abode of the Sama Veda. The waters are remembered as the abode of the Bhrigus and Angirasas.
1.5.25.7	The Rg Veda has Agni as its deity, the Yajur Veda has Vayu as its deity, and the Sama Veda has Aditya as its deity. The Bhrigus and the Angirasas have the moon and lightning as their deities.
1.5.25.8	The Trivṛt stoma of the Ṛgveda was born with the Pañcadaśa and Saptadaśa stomas. The Ekavimśa stoma is the limit of the Brahma.
1.5.25.9	The Ṛgveda is said to be in the inner self, the Yajus in the breath, the Sāmaveda in the eyes, and the mind of the Bhṛgvas and Aṅgiras is said to be the Veda.
1.5.25.10	The Rg verses are said to be born with the Gayatri metre, the Yajus verses with the Tristubh metre, the hymns of the Bhrigus and Angirasas with the Ushnih and Kakubh metres, and the Sama verses with the Jagati metre.
1.5.25.11	The earth is conquered by the Rig-Veda, the sky by the Yajur-Veda, heaven by the Sama-Veda, and the sacrifice is protected by the Atharva-Veda and the Angiras-Veda. The sacrifice with four feet carries heaven.
1.5.25.12	The sacrifice, praised by the Rigveda, purified by the Yajurveda, praised by the Samaveda, conquered by the Atharvaveda, and protected by the Angirasas, ascended to heaven with four feet.
1.5.25.13	The one who knows the Ṛgveda knows the earth, the one who knows the Yajurveda knows the great firmament, the one who is a knower of the Sāmaveda knows the heaven, the one who has knowledge of the Bhṛgvas and Aṅgiras knows all the worlds.
1.5.25.14	All the many kinds of mantras that are recited in villages and forests by people for various purposes, all those sacrifices flow into the Angirasas. That is the new path of Brahma, which is the best.
1.5.25.15	The heaven, the heaven of the gods, the heaven of Indra, the heaven of Yama, the heaven of Varuna, the heaven of Vayu, the heaven of Kubera, the heaven of Parjanya, the heaven of Aryaman, the heaven of Mitra, the heaven of Savitar, the heaven of Sarasvati, the heaven of Pusan, the heaven of Vishnu, the heaven of Ishana, the heaven of Brahma, the heaven of Prajapati, the heaven of Rudra, the heaven of Nirriti, the heaven of Ananta, the heaven of Vasava, the heaven of Viriñci, the heaven of Dhruva, the heaven of Sadhyas, the heaven of Maruts, the heaven of Somas, the heaven of Gandharvas, the heaven of Apsaras, the heaven of Yakshas, the heaven called Trayastrimsat, the heaven called Triviṣṭapa, the heaven called heaven, the heaven called supreme heaven, he goes to that heaven by means of this threefold knowledge. Beyond that are the great Brahma worlds, that is the destination of the Atharvan and Angirasas.
1.5.25.16	That is the destination of Atharvan and the Angirasas. This is the Brahmanical text.
2.1.1.1	And when he removes the grass from the seat of Brahma, he purifies it.
2.1.1.2	Then he sits down, saying, "I sit down in the abode of Arvāgvasu."
2.1.1.3	Arvāgvasu was indeed the Brahman of the gods, Parāgvasu of the Asuras.
2.1.1.4	He thus settles him first.
2.1.1.5	"May he perform the sacrifice without injury,"
2.1.1.6	Then, having sat down, he mutters, "Brihaspati is the Brahman."
2.1.1.7	Brihaspati Angiras was the Brahman of the Gods.
2.1.1.8	In that very (place) he desires to obtain permission. When the offerings are being made or have been made, he restrains his speech until the oblations have been offered and the sprinkling (of the Soma) has taken place.
2.1.1.9	This is indeed the gate of the sacrifice.
2.1.1.10	He makes it not empty.
2.1.1.11	When the Iṣṭi and Svishtakṛt offerings have been made, because of the pouring out of the Anuyājas.
2.1.1.12	This is the second gate of the sacrifice.
2.1.1.13	He thus makes it not empty.
2.1.1.14	When the enclosing sticks are placed around, it is for the protection of the sacrifice.
2.1.1.15	He places the enclosing sticks around, for the sacrifice to have a self.
2.1.1.16	He cleanses the enclosing sticks.
2.1.1.17	He purifies them.
2.1.1.18	Three times the middle one.
2.1.1.19	These are the three breaths.
2.1.1.20	He conquers the breaths.
2.1.1.21	Three times to the right.
2.1.1.22	These are indeed the three worlds.
2.1.1.23	He conquers the worlds.
2.1.1.24	Three times he recites the last half of the verse.
2.1.1.25	There are three divine worlds.
2.1.1.26	He conquers the divine worlds.
2.1.1.27	Three (times) he recites the verse.
2.1.1.28	The three paths to the divine world.
2.1.1.29	He conqueres them.
2.1.1.30	They become twelve.
2.1.1.31	Twelve months are a year.
2.1.1.32	He pleases the year with that.
2.1.1.33	Then he lays down the year itself for him, for the completion of the heavenly world.
2.1.2.1	Prajapati divided the sacrifices among Rudra.
2.1.2.2	He desired:
2.1.2.3	"May my intention be fulfilled, he who divided the sacrifices from me."
2.1.2.4	He approached the sacrifice and pierced it.
2.1.2.5	That which was pierced he cut off.
2.1.2.6	That became the flesh of the victim.
2.1.2.7	He took it up.
2.1.2.8	He took it away from Bhaga.
2.1.2.9	He saw it.
2.1.2.10	His eyes fell down.
2.1.2.11	Therefore they say, "Bhaga is blind."
2.1.2.12	One should not desire him whom one desires.
2.1.2.13	He took (it) away from Savitr.
2.1.2.14	He accepted it.
2.1.2.15	His hands were cut off.
2.1.2.16	They placed two golden ones for him.
2.1.2.17	Therefore he is praised as Hiranyapani.
2.1.2.18	He took it away for Pusan.
2.1.2.19	He ate it.
2.1.2.20	His teeth fell out.
2.1.2.21	Therefore they say, "Pusan is toothless, he eats from a mortar."
2.1.2.22	He took it for Angiras of the kindling wood.
2.1.2.23	He ate that.
2.1.2.24	His head fell off.
2.1.2.25	The sacrifice itself made him.
2.1.2.26	This is the sacrificial grass.
2.1.2.27	The Samidha was formerly the ancient one.
2.1.2.28	It was taken away by Angiras from Barhi.
2.1.2.29	He ate it.
2.1.2.30	Its limbs and joints fell down.
2.1.2.31	The sacrifice itself created it.
2.1.2.32	This is the sacrificial grass (Barhi).
2.1.2.33	The Prasara was formerly the ancient.
2.1.2.34	It was brought by Angiras from Brihaspati.
2.1.2.35	Brihaspati was afraid, thinking, "In this way, he will certainly cause me harm."
2.1.2.36	He saw this mantra:
2.1.2.37	"I am waiting for you with the eye of the sun," he said.
2.1.2.38	For the eye of the Sun does not harm anything.
2.1.2.39	He was afraid, thinking "He will harm me when I accept."
2.1.2.40	"With the impulse of the divine Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, I receive thee with the permission." So he said.
2.1.2.41	He received him with the impulse of Savitr, with deities.
2.1.2.42	Having arranged the grass, he places the staff with the handle towards the east on the mound, saying, "I place thee in the navel of the earth."
2.1.2.43	Earth is the pacifier of all foods. He pacified him with that.
2.1.2.44	He feared, "May he not harm the eater."
2.1.2.45	He said, "I eat with the mouth of Agni."
2.1.2.46	For nothing harms the mouth of Agni.
2.1.2.47	He feared "May he not hurt the eaten."
2.1.2.48	"He said, 'I place you in Indra's belly.'
2.1.2.49	For nothing harms Indra's belly.
2.1.2.50	'In Varuna's belly,' for nothing harms Varuna's stomach.'
2.1.3.1	Some say, 'In the belly of a brahmin.'
2.1.3.2	'In your self, may you not harm me. Svāhā!'
2.1.3.3	Food is the self of all beings. By that alone he pacified him.
2.1.3.4	He recites the following verse while eating: "The Agni who is called the man among men, having entered the Brahmanas, may this offering of mine be well-offered in him. May it not harm me in the supreme heaven."
2.1.3.5	Then he ate it with all the Brahmanas.
2.1.3.6	Then he did not harm him.
2.1.3.7	Therefore, he should appoint as the Brahman one who is the most learned in the Veda.
2.1.3.8	Brihaspati is indeed the entire Brahman.
2.1.3.9	Indeed, with the entire Brahman, the sacrifice is raised up towards the south.
2.1.3.10	Indeed, the vital airs depart from him who eats what has been shaken.
2.1.3.11	Having sprinkled with water, he touches the vital airs, saying, "May my speech be in my mouth."
2.1.3.12	The vital airs are indeed nectar.
2.1.3.13	Water is nectar.
2.1.3.14	He invites the vital airs to their proper places.
2.1.3.15	Some indeed say, "He takes it away for Indra."
2.1.3.16	The gods said, "Indra is indeed the strongest and most powerful among the gods.
2.1.3.17	Therefore, he takes it away for him."
2.1.3.18	They took it away for him.
2.1.3.19	He pacified it with Brahma.
2.1.3.20	Therefore they say, "Indra is Brahman."
2.1.3.21	It is the size of a barley grain.
2.1.3.22	The poison does not harm one who is the size of barley.
2.1.3.23	Because he pours it below, therefore the poison flows below. The poison does not harm the offspring.
2.1.3.24	Because he sprinkles it above, therefore the poison drips above. The poison does no harm to the offspring.
2.1.3.25	If one were to pour over both sides, then the offspring would be killed.
2.1.3.26	If one were to pour in between, then the sacrifice would be pierced.
2.1.4.1	One should remove it from the front.
2.1.4.2	One should take it away by the right.
2.1.4.3	The sacrifice is indeed cut off when one takes away the prasitra.
2.1.4.4-8	What he says, "O Brahman, I am going to depart," Bṛhaspati is the entire Brahman. Indeed, he establishes the sacrifice on the right side with the entire Brahman. Here the sacrifice is indeed established where the Brahman is. He offers it from there itself. If he were to touch it with his hand, he would tremble.
2.1.4.9	The one who would be the head of the sacrifice should be the one with the head.
2.1.4.10	If he were to remain silent, the sacrifice would be incomplete.
2.1.4.11	One should say, "For the establishment."
2.1.4.12	The sacrifice is indeed based on speech.
2.1.4.13	Where the Brahman is, where the sacrifice is based, from there he gives it back.
2.1.4.14	The Agnidhra (priest) places (the fire).
2.1.4.15	He pleases the seasons with Agni as the head.
2.1.4.16	Then for the establishment of the offerings to the northern quarters.
2.1.4.17	Then he offers on the fire-sticks.
2.1.4.18	He cleanses the enclosing sticks.
2.1.4.19	He cleans them indeed.
2.1.4.20	He cleans each one only once.
2.1.4.21	For now the sacrifice is indeed turned away.
2.1.4.22	It becomes fourfold.
2.1.4.23	And the animals have four feet.
2.1.4.24	For the attainment of animals.
2.1.4.25	"O god Savitar, this is told to you." He says this for the sake of prosperity.
2.1.4.26	"He says, 'Brihaspati is Brahman.'
2.1.4.27	For he is the most Brahmanic.
2.1.4.28	'Protect the sacrifice, protect the lord of sacrifice, protect me, protect me in the performance of rites,' he says.
2.1.4.29	For the attainment of sacrifice and the sacrificer and for the attainment of cattle.
2.1.5.1	Offerings are not made at the full moon or new moon.
2.1.5.2	This oblation is cooked and this offering is made for the prosperity of the sacrifice.
2.1.5.3	One performs the Iṣṭi with this (oblation) and one performs the Pūrti with this (obltion) which is cooked.
2.1.5.4	This is indeed the Iṣṭāpūrti, which is cooked.
2.1.6.1	The two kinds of gods come to the house of the sacrificer, some who drink Soma and others who do not drink Soma.
2.1.6.2	Some are givers of oblations and others are not givers of oblation.
2.1.6.3	The gods who are not givers are the Brahmanas.
2.1.6.4	He who is the descendant of Purani belongs to these gods.
2.1.6.5	These indeed are the lords of his progeny and cattle.
2.1.6.6	They, being displeased, take away his food and strength.
2.1.6.7	When he brings the Anvāhārya rice, he pleases them with that.
2.1.6.8	He says to those who are sitting on the right side, "You should take the oblations."
2.1.6.9	One performs the sacrifice facing south.
2.1.6.10	By means of oblations, he pleases the gods who have been offered; by means of gifts, the human gods.
2.1.6.11	They bestow on him food and strength.
2.1.7.1	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
2.1.7.2	The gods worshipped Prajapati alone.
2.1.7.3	The Asuras did not worship each other.
2.1.7.4	The gods saw this rice-pudding.
2.1.7.5	They offered it as a share to Prajapati.
2.1.7.6-10	Seeing that share, Prajapati turned to the gods. Then the gods became victorious over the Asuras. He who, knowing this, cooks this rice, becomes victorious over his enemies, and his hateful enemy becomes defeated. Prajapati allotted the shares to the gods. He thought, "I am among them."
2.1.7.11	He saw this rice-pudding not offered.
2.1.7.12	He offered it as his share.
2.1.7.13	This is the share of Prajapati.
2.1.7.14	It should be unlimited.
2.1.7.15	For Prajapati is unlimited.
2.1.7.16	Prajapati's share is this, full of energy and milk.
2.1.7.17	You are inexhaustible.
2.1.7.18	For the inexhaustible one you.
2.1.7.19	May I not be deprived of you in the other world, in this world.
2.1.7.20	Protect my Prāṇa and Apāna.
2.1.7.21	Protect my Samāna and Vyāna.
2.1.7.22	Protect me in the form of Uḍāna.
2.1.7.23	You are energy.
2.1.7.24	Bestow energy on me.
2.1.7.25	Do not hinder me while I am doing.
2.1.7.26	Do not obstruct me while I am giving.
2.1.7.27	I shall prosper in the presence of Prajapati through you."
2.1.7.28	He who knows this, he who knows this, prospers in the presence of prajapati.
2.1.8.1	Those who have attained here by means of sacrifices, their are these luminaries, the stars.
2.1.8.2	That is the reason why the stars are called nakshatra, because they do not perish.
2.1.8.3	The new and full moon sacrifices are the concluding sacrifices.
2.1.8.4	Those who do not offer the Darsha-Paurnamasa sacrifices and do not worship with Soma, for them these are the luminaries, the stars which seem to fall.
2.1.8.5	Just as here, at the end of the year, one says, "You will not stay here, you will not stay here," and they do not go away, so also they do not go beyond this world.
2.1.8.6	They fall away.
2.1.9.1	If the oblation is offered before the moon rises, then one should divide the rice into three parts.
2.1.9.2	The middle ones should be offered to Agni Datra in eight pot-shaped cakes.
2.1.9.3	The largest ones should be offered as cooked rice to Indra Pradatra.
2.1.9.4	The smallest ones should be offered in cooked rice to Vishnu Sipivista.
2.1.9.5	These are the animals that have been left out.
2.1.9.6	He obtains them.
2.1.9.7	He wins them.
2.1.9.8	Agni is the giver of the middle, Indra is the giver of what is best.
2.1.9.9	What is the smallest among animals, that is Vishnu's shipivista.
2.1.9.10	He obtains it.
2.1.9.11	He wins animals.
2.1.10.1	The earlier full moon is Anumati.
2.1.10.2	The later is Raka.
2.1.10.3	The new moon that comes first is Sinivāli, the one that comes later is Kuhu.
2.1.10.4	The moon itself is the creator and the regulator.
2.1.10.5	When the full moon stays in one place and the new moon in another, that is the union.
2.1.10.6	When the moon sees one and not the other, that is the conjugal union.
2.1.10.7	When a new moon is born on the new moon day, that is the conjunction.
2.1.10.8	Therefore, from that very pair, he generates cattle.
2.1.11.1	One should not perform two sacrifices.
2.1.11.2	If one were to perform the first sacrifice, one would be performing the second.
2.1.11.3	If one performs the second sacrifice, one would perform the first.
2.1.11.4	There is no sacrifice, no offering.
2.1.11.5	One becomes timid, timid, and timid.
2.1.11.6	One should perform only one sacrifice.
2.1.11.7-12	He becomes eloquent. One should perform the two sacrifices without heeding that. One seizes the mouth of the sacrifice with the former, and performs the sacrifice with the latter. One attains the deity with the former, the power with the latter. One seizes the world of the gods with the former, of men with the latter. He approaches the greater sacrificial rites. This indeed is the Soma-sacrifice called Sumanas.
2.1.11.13	The one who rises today and the one who rises tomorrow, may they be for us in this world.
2.1.12.1	One who is about to perform the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices should offer an eleven-pot offering to Agni-Viṣṇu.
2.1.12.2	Agni is all the deities, Viṣṇu is the sacrifice.
2.1.12.3	One undertakes both the deities and the sacrifice for prosperity.
2.1.12.4	One indeed prospers.
2.1.12.5	They say that both are to be performed together.
2.1.12.6	The white (rite) is performed on the eastern peak.
2.1.12.7	The Darśa is the earlier of the two, and the Pūrṇamāsa is the later.
2.1.12.8	And what is performed after the Pūrṇimāsa, that is done as before.
2.1.12.9	If one were to commence the Full-moon sacrifice, one should offer a cake on twelve potshards to Sarasvati and a cake on eight potshards to Saravasvati. The New-moon is Sarasvati and the Full-moon is Saravasvati.
2.1.12.10	One thus commences both of them together for prosperity.
2.1.12.11	One indeed prospers.
2.1.13.1	If one's prescribed sacrifice is transgressed, one should offer an eight-potshered cake to Agni, the path-maker.
2.1.13.2	He who has a known Iṣṭi-sacrifice goes beyond the path.
2.1.13.3	Agni is the path-maker of the gods.
2.1.13.4	He approaches him with his own share.
2.1.13.5	He leads him along the path.
2.1.13.6	The bull is the dakṣiṇā.
2.1.13.7	For he carries along the path.
2.1.14.1	One who has set up the sacred fire should offer an oblation to Agni, the lord of vows, in eight potsherds, if he has to go away.
2.1.14.2	One who has set up a sacred fire and goes away commits many transgressions of the vow, such as approaching a woman or eating meat on the day of the vow.
2.1.14.3	Agni is the lord of vows among the gods.
2.1.14.4	Agni has gone to the vow of this one.
2.1.14.5	Therefore one should perform this vow.
2.1.15.1	One who has established the sacred fire should offer an oblation of eight potfuls to Agni, the upholder of vows, if he sheds tears due to misfortune.
2.1.15.2	One who establishes the sacred fire is brought to the gods.
2.1.15.3	Therefore, one should not shed tears with this.
2.1.15.4	For the gods do not shed tears.
2.1.15.5	Agni indeed is the bearer of the vows of the gods.
2.1.15.6	Agni went to the vow of this (Soma-sacrifice).
2.1.15.7	Therefore one should perform the vow of this sacrifice.
2.1.16.1	One should offer a bull belonging to Indra and Agni to one whose father and grandfather did not drink Soma.
2.1.16.2	One whose father and grandfather do not drink Soma is deprived of the power and strength of Indra.
2.1.16.3-7	Whatever is Indra, that is the power. Thus he makes him prosper by power. He who does not drink Soma, his father and grandfather are deprived of power by the deities. Whatever is Agni, that is all the deities. Thus he makes him prosper with all the deities. He becomes followed.
2.1.16.8	For the drinking of Soma is as if transmitted to him whose father and grandfather did not drink Soma.
2.1.16.9	Therefore he alone is the most prosperous of the animals of that deity.
2.1.17.1	The gods, when the plants were ripe, fought for the prize.
2.1.17.2	Indra knew: Agni alone will first win them.
2.1.17.3	He said, "Whichever of us conquers first, let him conquer for both of us."
2.1.17.4	Agni conquered.
2.1.17.5	Indra conquered after him.
2.1.17.6	He is Indra-Agni, and Agni-Indra.
2.1.17.7	At that time there was only one kind of barley, one kind of rice, one kind of peas, and one kind of sesame.
2.1.17.8	The All-gods said, "We shall extend this; let there be a share for us."
2.1.17.9	That is the Vaiśvadeva (rite) on the earth.
2.1.17.10	And one extends it by this (rite).
2.1.17.11	It should be done in milk for the sake of being Vaiśvadeva.
2.1.17.12	Milk is Vaiśvadeva.
2.1.17.13	Then they said, "You are not giving us our share. You are promoting this among us. It is established in me. He cooks with rain. He will not be able to overcome this."
2.1.17.14	"Let there be no share for us."
2.1.17.15	This share is given to them for the sake of overcoming (the enemy) and for the sake of establishment.
2.1.17.16	He who belongs to heaven and earth.
2.1.17.17	The plants are Soma's.
2.1.17.18	Soma is the king of plants.
2.1.17.19	Those that are in the village and those that are in the forest, this is their selection, namely, the black gram.
2.1.17.20	The black gram belongs to Soma; he makes him the sole recipient.
2.1.17.21	If one were to eat new grain without performing the Agrayaṇas, one would be eating the share of the gods that has been dedicated.
2.1.17.22	The Agrayana is the first-born after a year.
2.1.17.23	Brahma is a year.
2.1.17.24	Therefore Brahma should pour out at the Homa-stand before the Homa.
2.1.17.25	The Dakshina is one-day-old.
2.1.17.26	For it is the image of a year.
2.1.17.27	For this is the semen, not yet born.
2.1.17.28	For procreation.
2.1.18.1	Then indeed this is Indra's invincible arms, the two strong bulls.
2.1.18.2	By this indeed Indra conquered the Asuras.
2.1.18.3	By this the sacrificer conquers his enemy. He becomes invincible.
2.1.18.4	One should offer in battle. One becomes invincible.
2.1.18.5	By this, indeed, Bharadvaja bound Pratardana.
2.1.18.6	He became a king.
2.1.18.7	He whom one desires to be a king, one should bind him with this (mantra).
2.1.18.8	He becomes a king.
2.1.18.9	Indeed, Indra conquered Viraj with this (mantras).
2.1.18.10	One should offer ten (bricks).
2.1.18.11	Viraj has ten syllables. By this the sacrificer conquers his enemy.
2.1.18.12	Some indeed offer eleven (bricks).
2.1.18.13	The Tristubh metre has eleven syllables. The thunderbolt is Tristubh.
2.1.18.14-18	He thus wards off the Rakshas with the thunderbolt. The Rakshas attacked the sacrifice of the gods from the south. They were slain by Aparathas. Therefore the Brahman goes reciting Aparathas. The Brahman goes reciting Aparatha for the conquest of the sacrifice, for the slaying of the Rakshas.
2.1.19.1	Now, then, the performance of the Cāturmāsya rites.
2.1.19.2	One should perform the Cāturmāsyas on the full moon day of Phālguna.
2.1.19.3	The full moon day of Phalguna is the beginning of the year, the Uttara Phālgunī is the tail, and the Pūrvā Phālgunī.
2.1.19.4	Just as the beginning and end of a proceeding are joined together, so also here the beginning and end are joined together.
2.1.19.5	Now, when he performs the Cāturmāsya sacrifices on the full moon day of Phālguna, he employs the year from the very beginning.
2.1.19.6	Now, these are indeed sacrifices for healing, since they are Cāturmāsyas.
2.1.19.7	Therefore, they are employed at the junctions of seasons.
2.1.19.8	For, diseases occur at the junctions of the seasons.
2.1.19.9	These are the eight oblations.
2.1.19.10	There are eight oblations for the four full-moon sacrifices.
2.1.19.11	The Vaiśvadeva (sacrifice) is the combination of the four full-moons.
2.1.19.12	Then when they churn the fire, it is the Vaiśvadeva of Prajapati.
2.1.19.13	It is indeed for procreation.
2.1.19.14	Then he generates this divine embryo.
2.1.19.15	Now, as to why there are seventeen Sāmidhenī verses, Prajapati is indeed seventeenfold.
2.1.19.16	For the attainment of Prajapati.
2.1.19.17	Now, as to why the two Ajyabhāga portions are at the end, they are indeed at the end.
2.1.19.18	Now, why the two Samyājyā verses are Viraj, Viraj is indeed food, for the attainment of food and prosperity.
2.1.19.19	Now, since there are nine Prayājas, nine Anuyājas, eight oblations, and the Vājinī is the ninth, he attains the Viraj of the stars.
2.1.19.20	But they say that it is the Viraj of ten, namely, the Prayājas, Anuyājas and oblations, the two Āghāras and the two Ajyabhagas.
2.1.20.1	Now, when he offers to Agni and Soma as the first deities, Agni and Soma are the mouth of the gods.
2.1.20.2	He thus pleases the gods through their mouth.
2.1.20.3	When he offers to Savitr, Savitr is that one who shines.
2.1.20.4	He thus delights him.
2.1.20.5	When he makes an offering to Sarasvati, Sarasvati is speech.
2.1.20.6	He pleases speech with this.
2.1.20.7	Then why he offers to Pusan, that is Pusan who shines.
2.1.20.8	He pleases him with this.
2.1.20.9	And why he offers to the Maruts, the self-moving ones, the Maruts are terrible, self-moving ones.
2.1.20.10	He pleases them with this.
2.1.20.11	Why he offers to all the gods, all the gods are these.
2.1.20.12	He thus pleases them.
2.1.20.13	Now, when he offers to heaven and earth, heaven and earth are indeed the foundation.
2.1.20.14	It is indeed through foundation.
2.1.20.15	Now, the Vājinis are indeed cattle.
2.1.20.16	He thus pleases them through cattle.
2.1.20.17	And the Vājinīs are indeed the seasons.
2.1.20.18	He thus delights them through the seasons.
2.1.20.19	Now, indeed, the Vājinis are the metres.
2.1.20.20	By that he pleases the metres.
2.1.20.21	Now, indeed, the horses of the gods are the Vājinīs.
2.1.20.22	Here the gods with their horses are pleased and satisfied.
2.1.20.23	And when he performs the Full-moon sacrifice afterwards, then his sacrifice in the bright fortnight becomes performed by the Vaishvadev (sacrifice).
2.1.21.1	By the Vaishvadeva sacrifice indeed Prajapati created the creatures.
2.1.21.2-5	Those created by him, not giving birth, ate the barley of Varuna. Varuna bound them with the noose of Varuna. Those creatures, having gone to their father Prajapati, complained to him, "Know that sacrifice by which having worshipped Varuna, he was pleased." Varuna was pleased.
2.1.21.6	They are released from the noose of Varuna and from all sins.
2.1.21.7	Then Prajapati saw this sacrifice, the Varunapraghasa.
2.1.21.8	He brought it.
2.1.21.9	He performed it.
2.1.21.10	Having performed it, he pleased Varuna.
2.1.21.11	Varuna, being pleased, released the creatures from the noose and from all sins.
2.1.21.12	Indeed, his progeny are released from the noose of Varuna and from all sin, he who knows this.
2.1.21.13	And when they carry the fire, they carry him whom they churn in the Vaisvadeva rite.
2.1.21.14	The significance of the churning has been explained.
2.1.21.15	Now as to why there are seventeen kindling verses, the two portions of butter at the end of the sacrifice, and the two offerings to Viraj, the Brāhmaṇa concerning them has been explained.
2.1.21.16	Now as to why there is nine fore-offerings, nine after-offerings, and nine oblations.
2.1.21.17	But the five oblations which are common to all are the same, ending with those to Pusan.
2.1.21.18	The Brāhmaṇa about them has been explained.
2.1.22.1	Now, why the offering to Indra-Agni is made with twelve potsherds, is because Indra-Agni are strength and brilliance.
2.1.22.2	He thus establishes strength in brilliance.
2.1.22.3	Now, why the offering is made to Varuna with curds, is because Varuna is Indra.
2.1.22.4	He is the one who has the share of milk.
2.1.22.5	Therefore the offering is made with curds to Varuna.
2.1.22.6	Now, the offering to Maruts is made with milk, because the Maruts are in the waters.
2.1.22.7	The waters are milk.
2.1.22.8-14	Then Indra's Maruts resorted to Indra's milk. From that the Marutī Payasyā. Then the one-pot offering to Ka is for Prajapati, for Ka is Prajapati. For attaining Prajapati. Also, the name of happiness is Ka. He places that happiness within himself. Then when he gives a pair of cows, that is the form for progeny.
2.1.22.15	The Utkhyas are the Vājinah.
2.1.22.16	Now when he offers to Varuna in the waters, he thus pleases him in his own abode.
2.1.22.17	And when he offers with the full-moon sacrifice beyond that, then his offering with the Varuna-grahas becomes made in the former half (of the month).
2.1.23.1	The Sakamedha is indeed a Yajna-kratu of Indra.
2.1.23.2	Just as a great king, having arranged his army in battle array, marches along a safe path, so here also he offers to the gods in front.
2.1.23.3	Just as the Soma sacrifice is the great vow, so this Iṣṭi is the great vow.
2.1.23.4	And why he offers to Agni, the leader of the army, first among the gods, Agni is the mouth of the gods.
2.1.23.5	He pleases the gods with his mouth alone.
2.1.23.6	Now, why he offers to the Maruts, the Scorchers, at midday, is that the Maruts, indeed, are the Scorchers.
2.1.23.7	The midday (rite) is connected with Indra.
2.1.23.8	Therefore, he offers them united with Indra.
2.1.23.9	Now, when they perform the rite of the householder at evening, the rite of the house-holder is a rite of prosperity.
2.1.23.10	Evening is the prosperity of cattle.
2.1.23.11	Therefore they perform the Grīṣmīya rite in the evening.
2.1.23.12	Then when they perform the Grīmśīya rite in morning with a pot full of the mixture of milk and water, they continue the rite of the previous day.
2.1.23.13	Then when he performs the rite for the playful Maruts in the morning, Indra is the playful Maruts.
2.1.23.14	Therefore he offers them in union with Indra.
2.1.23.15	Now when they lead Agni forward, they lead forward the same one whom they churn in the Vaisvadevya.
2.1.23.16	What is churned, that has been explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
2.1.23.17	Now when there are seventeen kindling verses, the two concluding oblations of clarified butter, the two Viraj verses, and the Samyājyā, their Brāhmaṇa has been explained.
2.1.23.18	Now, as to why there are nine Prayājas and nine Anuyājas, and eight oblations, but the six oblations are equal, and are offered in succession, ending with the offerings to Indra and Agni.
2.1.23.19	The Brāhmaṇa concerning them has been explained.
2.1.23.20	Now, as to why he offers to Mahendra at the end, the chief takes the end.
2.1.23.21	Therefore he offers to him at the end.
2.1.23.22	Now, the one-pot offering to Visvakarman is so called because he is the creator of all.
2.1.23.23	He thereby pleases him.
2.1.23.24	Now, why he gives a bull as a gift, is because the sacrifice is under Indra.
2.1.24.1	Now, the reason why they perform the Pitryajna in the afternoon is that the Pitrs are sharers of the afternoon.
2.1.24.2	Therefore, they perform the Pitrya in the afternoon.
2.1.24.3	They say, "Why do they offer to the Pitrs in the bright fortnight, when they belong to the dark fortnight?"
2.1.24.4	These are the gods, the Pitrs.
2.1.24.5	Therefore they offer to them in the bright fortnight."
2.1.24.6	And when he recites the Sāmidhenī verse three times, the Pitrs are indeed one.
2.1.24.7	Therefore he recites the Samidheni verse three times.
2.1.24.8	Now, when he says, "O Agni, do thou bring the sacrificer to the Rṣis," he means to say, "Do thou not injure the sacrificer."
2.1.24.9	Now, when he invites the Soma-drinking Fathers, the Fathers of Soma, the Fathers of the sacrificial grass, the Fathers of Agni, he means to say:
2.1.24.10	Some do not invite their own greatness, saying, "This is the greatness of the sacrificer." But it is indeed proper to invite.
2.1.24.11-16	For this is the great glory of Agni. He invites with "Oṃ, svadhā." He responds with "Let it be svadhā." For svadhā is the form of the Pitrs. Then why he takes up the oblations from the Prayāja and Anuyāja offerings, which are accompanied by the sacrificial grass, is to prevent the Pitrs from giving birth to offspring. They become six in number.
2.1.25.5	Now, indeed, he turns away the divine sacrifice by the sacrifice to the Pitrs.
2.1.25.6	Now, indeed, the sacrifice to the pitrs is on the right side.
2.1.25.7	Now, they make it on the left side.
2.1.25.8	Now when he offers to Agni Kavya-vahana at the end, the Pitrs are indeed the Svishtakrit.
2.1.25.9	Therefore he offers to Agni Kavyavahana at the end.
2.1.25.10	Now, when they do not eat after having called Iḍā and having sniffed, it is because Iḍā is cattle.
2.1.25.11	"They think, "We should not injure the cattle."
2.1.25.12	When they recite the benediction for the sacrificer in the Sūktavāka, they think, "We shall not injure the sacrificer."
2.1.25.13	When they do not consecrate the wife, they think, "We shall not injure our wife."
2.1.25.14	Now when they cleanse with the Pavitra-water, it is indeed peace and healing that is water.
2.1.25.15	This peace and healing is indeed done at the end of the sacrifice.
2.1.25.16	And when the Adhvaryu offers to the Pitrs, then indeed the men follow the living Pitrs. The Pitrs follow the offering.
2.1.25.17	And they turn him away from the divine sacrifice with the sacrifice to the Pitrs.
2.1.25.18	Now the Pitryajna is on the right side.
2.1.25.19	They make it on the left side.
2.1.25.20	And when they step forward and stand facing the sun, the sun is the world of the gods,
2.1.25.21	the fathers are the world of the fathers.
2.1.25.22	They thus pass from the world of the Fathers to the world of the Gods.
2.1.25.23	Now when they approach the fires after having gone beyond the southern boundary, it is for the sake of pleasing the gods that they perform the rites in the middle of the boundary.
2.1.25.24	And when they perform the rites with the Triyambaka hymns after having gone beyond to the north, they thus please Rudra in his own direction.
2.1.25.25	And they thus turn the divine sacrifice away from the sacrifice to the fathers.
2.1.25.26	Now the Pitryajna is indeed on the right side.
2.1.25.27	They make it on the left side.
2.1.25.28	Now when he offers the Aditi-sacrifice at the end, Aditi is this (earth).
2.1.25.29	He establishes him on this (earth) at the end.
2.1.25.30	And when he offers the Full-moon sacrifice beyond (the Aditi-sacrifice), then his sacrifice with the Soma-pressers' rites is performed in the bright fortnight.
2.1.26.1	He who performs the Śunāsīrī sacrifice attains the thirteenth month.
2.1.26.2	The year is of this extent, as is this thirteenth month.
2.1.26.3	Now when they lead Agni forward, they lead forward the same Agni whom they churn in the Vaisvadevya rite.
2.1.26.4	What is churned, that has been explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
2.1.26.5	If it is not churned, then the rite of the Full Moon becomes the rite.
2.1.26.6	The Full Moon is indeed the foundation.
2.1.26.7	It is indeed through the foundation.
2.1.26.8	Then, when one offers to Vayu, Vayu is indeed the breath.
2.1.26.9	One pleases the breath through that.
2.1.26.10	Then, if one offers to Shunashīra, Shunashīra is indeed the year.
2.1.26.11	One pleases it through that.
2.1.26.12	Now, when he offers to the Sun, it is this Sun that shines.
2.1.26.13	He thereby pleases him.
2.1.26.14	And when he gives a white cow as a gift, it is the form of this (Sun) that is made.
2.1.26.15	And when they perform the expiatory rite, they perform the rite for welfare.
2.1.26.16	It is for the peace of the sacrifice and for the healing of the sacrificer.
2.1.26.17	The gods, by means of these four-monthly (sacrifices), obtained all their desires, all their wishes, and immortality.
2.1.26.18	This very Prajapati is the twenty-four months, which are the four-monthly (offerings).
2.1.26.19	The Visvedevā (sacrifice) is indeed his mouth.
2.1.26.20	The Varuna-prastha (offerings) are his arms.
2.1.26.21	Prāṇa, Apāna, Vyāna, these are the three Iṣṭis.
2.1.26.22	The Self is the great oblation.
2.1.26.23	Pratiṣṭhā is the Sunaśīra.
2.1.26.24	Indeed, that very Prajapati is the four months.
2.1.26.25	Prajapati is the whole.
2.1.26.26	The four months are the whole.
2.1.26.27	He who knows this, and he who knowing this performs the Catu-rmasyas, he obtains everything by everything.
2.2.1.1	"The fires of the householder who has established the fire, are indeed worshipped."
2.2.1.2	They indeed think of him first, the sacrificer.
2.2.1.3-9	He who offers the animal to Indra-Agni every sixth month, thereby he frees himself from being devoured by Indra-Agni. One who desires long life should offer it. Indra-Agni are the vital breaths of inhalation and exhalation. He places the vital breaths of in- and exhalation within himself. He becomes long-lived. One who wishes for offspring should offer it. The vital breaths of in and exhalation are Indra-Agni.
2.2.1.10	The offspring are born from the Prāṇāpāna.
2.2.1.11	One becomes endowed with offspring.
2.2.1.12	One desiring cattle should offer a goat.
2.2.1.13	Prāṇāpānas are Indra and Agni.
2.2.1.14	Cattle are born from the prāṇāpānās.
2.2.1.15	One becomes possessed of cattle.
2.2.1.16	One who desires to be free from disease in the world of the ancestors should offer a parrot, a peacock, or a green (bird), or a heron.
2.2.1.17	By this (rite) Yama attained success in the other world.
2.2.1.18	One attains success in the world of the fathers itself.
2.2.1.19	One desiring offspring should offer a horse of Tvashtra.
2.2.1.20	Prajapati, desiring to create offspring, did not find a second mate.
2.2.1.21	He saw the horse of Tvashtri.
2.2.1.22	Tvashtri is the creator of forms.
2.2.1.23	With that he created offspring.
2.2.1.24	He found a mate with it.
2.2.1.25	He who knows this and he who, knowing this, offers this animal becomes one who has offspring and a mate.
2.2.1.26	He who offers a desirable animal without having offered the animal to Indra and Agni offers animals that are desirable and have a womb. The offering is for prosperity.
2.2.2.1	The gods, in five ways, went forth: Agni with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras, Indra with the Maruts, Varuna with the Adityas, Brihaspati with the All-gods.
2.2.2.2	The gods said: We shall conquer our enemies, the Asuras, by whom we are separated from one another.
2.2.2.3-7	Those who are dear to these bodies, we have united them together. They united them together. From among them he was excluded, the one who first would do harm to one another. Because they united their bodies, that is why Tānūnaptr is called Tānūnapta. Then the gods became victorious, the Asuras were defeated.
2.2.2.8	Therefore, he who first injures the Tanunaptras, he meets with calamity.
2.2.2.9	When one offers the Tanunaptra oblation, it is for the sake of overpowering the enemies.
2.2.2.10	One becomes superior to one's own self and the enemy becomes hateful.
2.2.3.1	One offers five times.
2.2.3.2	The sacrifice is fivefold.
2.2.3.3	For they offered them in five ways.
2.2.3.4	"I take thee for the approaching one." He says this.
2.2.3.5	The approaching one is the breath.
2.2.3.6	He thus pleases the breath.
2.2.3.7	"I take thee for him who approaches from all sides." He says this
2.2.3.8	Him who approaches from all directions is the mind.
2.2.3.9	He thus delights the mind.
2.2.3.10	"For Tanunaptra." He says this,
2.2.3.11	For the Tanus (bodies) of yours were united with them.
2.2.3.12	"For Shakra." He says this;
2.2.3.13	For the Shaktis (powers) of yours were joined with them.
2.2.3.14	He says, "To the most powerful Shakmans."
2.2.3.15	For that is the most powerful of your own selves.
2.2.3.16	He says, "Unassailable."
2.2.3.17	For this is indeed unassailable.
2.2.3.18	He says "Unassailablc."
2.2.3.19	For this indeed is unassailable
2.2.3.20	He says, "The strength of the gods."
2.2.3.21	For this strength of the gods.
2.2.3.22	He says, "May the lord of the curse be pleased with me."
2.2.3.23	For the lord of the curses is indeed pleased with him.
2.2.3.24	He says, "May he who is not cursed be pleased with me"
2.2.3.25	For he who is not condemned is indeed pleased with it.
2.2.3.26	"May the lord of initiation be pleased with my initiation, may the lord of austerity be pleased with my austerity. May I go to truth by the straight path. May you support me." He says this according to the prescribed ritual.
2.2.4.1	The gods, having made ghee into a thunderbolt, struck Soma.
2.2.4.2	The two ladles are the arms.
2.2.4.3	Therefore the two ladles do not burn the Soma offering.
2.2.4.4	Soma would be killed.
2.2.4.5	Therefore he brought the ladle and the ghee close together.
2.2.4.6	Indeed, when one performs with Tānūnapāt, one performs close to him.
2.2.4.7	"Oṃ, Oṃ, Oṃ! May the Soma be nourished for Indra, the knower of one wealth." So he says.
2.2.4.8	Whatever of it is lost or measured, that they nourish with this.
2.2.4.9	"May Indra be nourished for you, may you be nourished for Indra." So he says,
2.2.4.10	Both Indra and Soma are nourished.
2.2.4.11	"May he nourish us, the friends, with wisdom, with offspring, with wealth." So he says.
2.2.4.12	The priests are his friends.
2.2.4.13	They nourish him with this.
2.2.4.14	"May you be well, O divine Soma, in the pressing and in the attainment of your goal." So he says,
2.2.4.15	He thus invokes a blessing.
2.2.4.16	Those who make Soma grow, they fall from this world.
2.2.4.17	For Soma, when made to grow, is of the nature of the atmosphere.
2.2.4.18	"He prays: "May we be blessed with wealth, may we be blessed with good things. May we be sent to Bhaga."
2.2.4.19	"Salute truth to those who speak truth. Salute heaven, salute earth."
2.2.4.20	Having saluted heaven and earth, he stands firm in this world."
2.2.5.1	The word 'Makh' is a name of sacrifice. It is so because of the power of the prohibition of the hole.
2.2.5.2	The hole is said to be the sky.
2.2.5.3	The prohibition of it is 'me'.
2.2.5.4	It means 'Do not make a hole'.
2.2.5.5	A sacrifice with a hole leaks like a broken ocean.
2.2.5.6	That hole occurs due to the absence of the officiating priests and the sacrificer.
2.2.5.7	Or, in view of these, the rites of the Brahmanas, which are based on mantras, are not performed, or the fees mentioned are not given, or they are given in excess or in deficiency, or there is transgression of the expiations in the case of calamities and omens.
2.2.5.8	All this is dedicated to Brahman.
2.2.5.9	The learned Brahman, who is well-versed in the Vedas, who is studying the Vedas, who has observed the life of a student, who is not deficient in any limb, who is not careless, protects the sacrifice.
2.2.5.10	If, through carelessness or absence, the boat should break apart in the deep water, it becomes the share of fish, turtles, sharks, crocodiles, otters, and other creatures that live on the dead.
2.2.5.11-12	Thus, even though the sacrifice is cut, broken, destroyed, and has many calamities and wonders, it is not properly performed by the Atharvas. It becomes the share of demons, Gandharvas, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Pisachas, and others who live on the destroyed.
2.2.5.13	The sacrifice was cut, broken, destroyed, and widely proclaimed. The sacrificer took the wealth of the desired and undesired, and it fell down.
2.2.5.14	For the destruction of the priests, the king, and the people, that year was cursed, where the sacrifice is cursed.
2.2.5.15	The sacrifice which is directed towards the south is known as Dakshina. The Rakshas have a share in it, which is deficient in limbs and not sanctified by the Veda.
2.2.5.16	The entire sacrifice consisting of four parts is created by the four priests. It is established with mantras of four kinds by the priests who are masters of the Veda.
2.2.5.17	By means of expiations, by means of contemplation, by means of permission and approval, and by means of oblations, Brahma should make good all the defects in the sacrifice.
2.2.5.18	Therefore, the sacrificer should choose as his Brahmaṇācārin one who knows the Brāhmaṇas of Bhṛgu and Aṅgiras.
2.2.5.19	For he saves the sacrifice. Thus says the Brāhmaṇa.
2.2.6.1	Sacrifice went away from the gods, saying, "I will not be your food."
2.2.6.2	"No," said the gods, "you will be our food."
2.2.6.3	The gods made him a sacrifice.
2.2.6.4	He, being made a sacrifice, did not shine forth.
2.2.6.5	Then the gods said:
2.2.6.6	"He, being made thus, will not be able to do it."
2.2.6.7	"Let us collect him."
2.2.6.8	They (the gods) made him whole.
2.2.6.9	Having made him whole, they said, "O Asvins, heal him."
2.2.6.10	The Asvins are the physicians of the gods.
2.2.6.11	The Asvins were the Adhvaryus.
2.2.6.12	Therefore the Adhvaryu collects the Gharma.
2.2.6.13	Having collected it, he says, "O Brahman, we shall proceed with the Hotṛ reciting the Gharma, the Udgātṛ chanting the Sāmans."
2.2.6.14	"Proceed with the Gharma," he permits.
2.2.6.15	They proceed with the Brahman as their leader.
2.2.6.16	Brahman is the lord of all that is produced.
2.2.6.17	For the sake of being led by Savitr.
2.2.6.18	"I am burning the heat, the Brahman, the unborn, this is the ancestral, the royal, the foremost." One should attend the burning heat, reciting half of each verse, excluding the challenge and response, with verses that are rich in form.
2.2.6.19	This is the prosperity of the sacrifice, namely, the prosperity of form.
2.2.6.20	If a rite is performed with the recitation of a Rig or Yajus, one attains the end of that sacrifice, if one knows this.
2.2.6.21	The Gharma is indeed the union of the gods.
2.2.6.22	Therefore they perform it in secret.
2.2.6.23	For the union of the two sexes is performed in secret.
2.2.6.24	This is called the union of the divine couple.
2.2.6.25	The Gwarma is its penis.
2.2.6.26	The two hooves are the two eggs.
2.2.6.27	The navel string is the skull.
2.2.6.28	The milk is the semen.
2.2.6.29	It places the semen in the fire, in the womb of the gods, for the purpose of procreation.
2.2.6.30	That Agni, the deity, is composed of the Rg, Yajus, Sama, Brahma, and Amrita, is endowed with all senses, and the sacrificer goes upward to the heavenly world.
2.2.6.31	They say, "One should not perform the Pravargya at the first sacrifice. The subsequent sacrificial rites may not be performed."
2.2.6.32	But if one is a learned one who is not a student, then he should perform the Pravargya.
2.2.6.33	It is known that the self is indeed the sacrifice.
2.2.6.34	One who performs the sacrifice without the Pravargya performs it with his head down.
2.2.6.35	The Pravargya is indeed the head of the sacrifice.
2.2.6.36	Therefore, one should perform the sacrifice with the Pravargya, not without it.
2.2.6.37	This is also recited by her: "Four corners, four sides, four gates."
2.2.7.1	The gods and the sages were engaged in a battle with the Asuras.
2.2.7.2	The Asuras had conquered these cities: an iron earth, a silver sky, and a tawny heaven.
2.2.7.3	The gods defeated the Asuras in each battle.
2.2.7.4	They knew that they were not in their own abodes.
2.2.7.5	Therefore they were defeated.
2.2.7.6	They performed these rites in front: the Havirdhana in heaven, the Agnidhra in the atmosphere, and the Sada in the earth.
2.2.7.7	The gods said, "Let us go to the Upasads."
2.2.7.8	"We conquer the great city by means of the Upasads."
2.2.7.9	They defeated them from these worlds.
2.2.7.10	One from this world, one from the sky, one from the earth.
2.2.7.11	Therefore they say, "One wins the great city by means of the Upasads."
2.2.7.12	They entered the seasons after being driven out from these worlds.
2.2.7.13	They entered six.
2.2.7.14	They drove them out from the seasons by means of the upasads.
2.2.7.15	From the two worlds, from the two worlds of space, from the two earths.
2.2.7.16	They entered the year, having been expelled from the seasons.
2.2.7.17	They became twelve.
2.2.7.18	They killed the years with the Upasads.
2.2.7.19	The four from the world beyond, the four from the sky, and the four from the earth.
2.2.7.20	They entered the days and nights after having eliminated the years.
2.2.7.21	When they came in the evening, they were led by the night; when in the morning, by the day.
2.2.7.22	Therefore, the cow fills her evening milk in the morning, and her morning milk in the evening.
2.2.7.23	They advanced, pushing them away from these worlds by means of the Upasads.
2.2.7.24	Then the gods became victorious over the Asuras.
2.2.7.25	He advances, pushing away the enemy from all these worlds, he who, knowing this, performs the Upasads;
2.2.8.1	There should be twelve Upasads for the Agniṣṭoma.
2.2.8.2	There should be no three Upasads for one who has not performed the Ahiranya sacrifice.
2.2.8.3	The sacrifice of the higher kind should be performed above, as the heavier load is placed on the neck. It may lead to distress.
2.2.8.4	One should perform the sacrifice for one who is twelve years deficient.
2.2.8.5	To be accepted back and to be prosperous.
2.2.8.6	There should be three Upasads for the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice for peace and non-deviation.
2.2.8.7	The gods could not conquer the Asuras for these worlds.
2.2.8.8	They conquered them with Agni as their leader.
2.2.8.9	Agni is the last of the offerings, and the last of the rites. Just as a lord of a fief conquers his fief, so do they conquer these worlds with Agni as their guide.
2.2.8.10	He who knows the Sadhyas, the gods, prospers for him.
2.2.8.11	These very worlds are the Sadhya gods.
2.2.8.12	He who knows these Sadhya gods prospers for him;
2.2.8.13	He prospers for him, he prospers for the other world, he prospers in this world, he who, knowing this, approaches the Upasads.
2.2.9.1	Then when the Adhvaryu says, "O Agnidh, proclaim the wives of the gods; O Subrahmanya, call out to Subrahmanya," standing facing east beyond the Garhapatya, the Agnidhra proclaims the wives of the Gods without eating.
2.2.9.2	Earth is the wife of Agni.
2.2.9.3	Speech is the wife of Vayu.
2.2.9.4	Sena is the wife of Indra.
2.2.9.5	Dhēna is the wife of Brihaspati.
2.2.9.6	Pathya is the wife of Pūshan.
2.2.9.7	Gāyatrī is the wife of the Vasus.
2.2.9.8	Trishtup is the wife of Rudras.
2.2.9.9	Jagatī is the wife of Ādityas.
2.2.9.10	Anushtup is the consort of Mitra.
2.2.9.11	Virāj is the wife of Varuna.
2.2.9.12	Paṅkti is the wife of Vishnu.
2.2.9.13	Dīkṣā is the wife of King Soma.
2.2.9.14	He who, knowing this, describes the wives of the gods as the Adhvaryu, goes above his rivals; his rivals do not go above him; he goes above his rivals.
2.2.10.1	Just as a chariot, going to each part, goes to the next part, so does the sacrifice, going to each form, go to the next form.
2.2.10.2	The Hotr should be recited before the Pracārin (chanting).
2.2.10.3	Vasishtha Satyaharva said this: "When it is said, 'Soma has been spilled,' do not be afraid. Go ahead and drink. Tomorrow I will establish Soma again."
2.2.10.4	He who knows this drinks Soma without it spilling.
2.2.10.5	He drinks Soma by churning it with flour while sitting on a mat.
2.2.10.6	I alone know the sacrifice in its entirety. He who knows this,
2.2.10.7	"He will not harm me."
2.2.10.8	He who knows this drinks Soma, he is not harmed by the Soma-drinkers.
2.2.10.9	They used to ask him, "Why do you drink Soma after churning it with flour while sitting on a mat?"
2.2.10.10	The Brahman said, "I establish the sacrifice in the deities." He who knows this, and he who knows this, offers expiation in the sacrifice for the sake of the sacrifice.
2.2.10.11	He establishes the sacrifice in the very deities.
2.2.10.12	One should offer for the sake of sacrifice.
2.2.10.13	For the sake of the origin.
2.2.10.14	The Yajna has thirty-three forms.
2.2.10.15	There are thirty-one Stoma-parts.
2.2.10.16	There are three Savanas.
2.2.10.17	The sacrifice is the fourth.
2.2.10.18	Hereby he connects the Stoma-parts with the Stoma- parts, the Savanas with the Savanas, and the sacrifice with the sacrifice.
2.2.10.19	All the limbs of his sacrifice are connected, all are accomplished, all are bound.
2.2.10.20	At the impulse of the divine Savitr, to Brihaspati be praise.
2.2.10.21	Whatever Savitr bestowed on the gods, thereby they prospered.
2.2.10.22	They praise at the impulse of Savitr.
2.2.10.23	They prosper.
2.2.10.24	His Stotras prosper at the sacrifice.
2.2.10.25	The sacrificer prospers, his offspring prospers.
2.2.10.26	His cattle prosper.
2.2.10.27	He who knows this becomes Brahman.
2.2.11.1	The gods and the Asuras were in competition.
2.2.11.2	The gods were performing the sacrifice together.
2.2.11.3	Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did that.
2.2.11.4	They did not succeed.
2.2.11.5	The gods said, "Let us lead this sacrifice beyond the Asuras. Let us perform it."
2.2.11.6	They went beyond, covering it with these (verses), "The Yajuses, the Samidhs, Svāhā!"
2.2.11.7	They performed that sacrifice beyond the Asura.
2.2.11.8	The Asuras did not follow their sacrifice.
2.2.11.9	Then the gods became victorious, the Asuras were defeated.
2.2.11.10	He who, knowing this, performs the sacrifice below the Asuras, becomes his own self and his hated enemy becomes destroyed.
2.2.11.11	One should offer with these (verses) in the sacrifice of the dead, with four each.
2.2.11.12	One should make the offering before the morning recitation.
2.2.11.13	The sacrifice is as big as this (verse). One takes possession of the sacrifice.
2.2.11.14	He who has the sacrifice is (the true sacrificer).
2.2.11.15	The other is not (the true sacrificers).
2.2.11.16	One should offer with these (sacrifices) before the twelve-day (sacrifice).
2.2.11.17	This indeed is the twelve-day sacrifice.
2.2.11.18	Having obtained that, one should offer with these.
2.2.11.19	Before the consecration.
2.2.11.20	This indeed is consecration.
2.2.11.21	Having obtained her, he should touch her with these (verses), "The gods worshipped the sacrifice with sacrifice."
2.2.12.1	Where he knows Brahman, Soma has not fallen, having thus worshipped him, he recites: "The god Savitar has become worthy of worship. Now he is to be praised by men at dawn. He who bestows wealth on humans, may he give us the best wealth here."
2.2.12.2	He offers seven times with the verse, "Those fires within the waters."
2.2.12.3	Whatever of his has been spilled, that he offers in the fire.
2.2.12.4	For Agni is the resting place of the well-offered oblations.
2.2.12.5	Then he offers the oblations of the Vaisvadevas and the Vaiparusha. "The drop has fallen down."
2.2.12.6	Whatever drops of his have fallen down while being poured out, those he offers in the Ahavaniya.
2.2.12.7	The Āhavaniya is the support of oblations.
2.2.12.8	"He says, "The drop that falls from thee."
2.2.12.9	A drop is a small quantity.
2.2.12.10	" "The ray that falls from thy arm, from the place of the Adhishvana, falls down from the arms, and falls on the Adhishvanas."
2.2.12.11	"The one who is on the other side of the Adhvaryu's strainer, I offer him with the mind, with the Vasat-utterance."
2.2.12.12	It becomes like the Vasat-uttered, the Svāhā-uttered, the offered.
2.2.13.1	The sages did not see Indra directly.
2.2.13.2	Only Vasiṣṭha saw him directly.
2.2.13.3	He feared, "Let them not tell the other sages."
2.2.13.4	He said, "I will tell you how your priests will beget offspring."
2.2.13.5	"Do not tell this to the other sages."
2.2.13.6	Therefore he spoke these Stomabhāga hymns.
2.2.13.7	Then the offspring were begotten by Vasiṣṭha as the priest.
2.2.13.8	The Stoma is their share.
2.2.13.9	That is why the Stomabhāgas are called Stomabhāgās.
2.2.13.10	"Thou art the ray, for the destruction (of the enemies).
2.2.13.11	The destruction (of the foes) is the gods.
2.2.13.12	He announces the sacrifice to the gods.
2.2.13.13	Thou art the approach, for the law (of the gods).
2.2.13.14	The law is the men.
2.2.13.15	He announces sacrifice to the men.
2.2.13.16	Thou art approach, thou art union, thou art protection.
2.2.13.17	There are three worlds.
2.2.13.18	He establishes the sacrifice in the worlds.
2.2.13.19	"Thou art the supporter."
2.2.13.20	He indeed wins rain.
2.2.13.21	"Thou art the morning, the rays of the day," he indeed makes a pair.
2.2.13.22	"Thou are the Uśija, the Praketa, the Sudita."
2.2.13.23	The Vasus are eight, the Rudras eleven, the Adityas twelve, the speech is thirty-two, the Svaras are thirty-three, the gods are thirty-three.
2.2.13.24	He offers the sacrifice to the gods.
2.2.13.25	"Ojas (vitality) art thou, to the fathers."
2.2.13.26	He thus transmits strength to the fathers.
2.2.13.27	"Tantr (thread) art thou, for the offspring."
2.2.13.28	He thus transmit offspring and cattle.
2.2.13.29	"Revat (prosperity) art thou, unto the plants."
2.2.13.30	He thus establishes the sacrifice in the plants.
2.2.13.31	You are the army of eight, for the cattle, for you.
2.2.13.32	He thus transmits cattle to the offspring.
2.2.13.33	You are the Abhijit.
2.2.13.34	The sixteen is indeed the thunderbolt.
2.2.13.35	The thunderbolt is averted.
2.2.13.36	Therefore this (verse) is averted from others.
2.2.13.37	You are not the thunderbolt.
2.2.13.38	Prajapati is the seventeen.
2.2.13.39	He indeed wins Prajapati.
2.2.14.1	You are the lord, you are the firm one, you are the serpent, you are the protector of life.
2.2.14.2	These (verses) - Prāṇa, Apāna, eye, ear - they made the man. He approaches the vital airs.
2.2.14.3	(He does so) by means of progeny.
2.2.14.4	You are the three-fold, you are the spreading, you are the self-spreading, you are the following-spreading.
2.2.14.5	He makes a couple.
2.2.14.6	You are the ascent, you are the growth, you are the increase, you are the expansion.
2.2.14.7	Indeed, Prajapati himself.
2.2.14.8	You are the wealth, you are the abundance, you are the splendor of the garment.
2.2.14.9	Indeed, the foundation.
2.2.14.10	You are stepping, you are stepping across, you are stepping up, you are stepping out.
2.2.14.11	Indeed, prosperity.
2.2.14.12	Whatever Savitar bestowed on the gods, thereby they prospered.
2.2.14.13	They praise with the hymns of Savitar.
2.2.14.14	They prosper.
2.2.14.15	"To Brihaspati, the praised one."
2.2.14.16	Brihaspati, the son of Angiras, was the priest of the gods.
2.2.14.17	"In accordance with that, "May there be prosperity" at the morning pressing."
2.2.14.18	The Rg verses are on both sides, the Atharva and Angiras verses are on both, the verses that are guarded are guarded, the verses that have been praised are praised.
2.2.14.19	"The verses that are on both sides are "O Bhuva, generate!" at the midday pressing.
2.2.14.20	The Yajus verses are on both the sides, the Atharvanga verses are on both.
2.2.14.21	The verses that are guarded, the guarded, the verses praised, the praised. The verses that are on the sides are "o Svar, generate!" in the third pressing."
2.2.14.22	Then, with the Sāman verses and the verses of Atharva and Angiras, which are guarded and guarded, he praises.
2.2.14.23	If it is a sacrifice without a Soma-sacrifice, or a sixteen-day sacrifice, or a horse sacrifice, or an Atiratra sacrifice, or a sacrifice for the attainment of heaven, then he permits with all the verses and all the Vyāhṛti verses.
2.2.14.24	"Oṃ, Bhūr, Bhuvaḥ, Svaḥ, Janat, Vardhat, Karat, Ruhat, Mahat, Tasham Oṃ. Indra-possessed, praise, thus the Indra-possessed, sing, thus the Indra possessed, praise."
2.2.14.25	One who knows this and one who, knowing this, offers Stomabhāga sacrifices becomes more powerful, more prosperous, and more dominant.
2.2.15.1	He who knows the long and short Stoma-parts, he should be the Brahman-priest at the Soma-sacrifices of two contending kings.
2.2.15.2	Prajapati, the Vasus, the Rudras, the Adityas, the Sadhyas, the Aptyas, the All-gods, all the gods, we invoke from all sides.
2.2.15.3	May it be ours alone among all people.
2.2.15.4	May he make his valour here.
2.2.15.5	These indeed are the Stomabhāgas, the long and short.
2.2.15.6	Reciting them, one should look at the Brahman of the others above and above.
2.2.15.7	Then the Brahman falls with his head down among them.
2.2.15.8	Then the sacrifice.
2.2.15.9	Then the sacrificer.
2.2.15.10	When the sacrificer falls with his head downwards, that place where they perform the sacrifice in that half (of the year) falls with its head downwards.
2.2.15.11	The gods and the Asuras performed the Soma-sacrifice together.
2.2.15.12	Then Brihaspati, the son of Angiras, became the priest of the gods.
2.2.15.13	He recited the Stoma-parts, both in the ascending and descending order, and looked at the priest of the Asuras from above.
2.2.15.14	Then the priest of them fell with his head downwards.
2.2.15.15	Then the sacrifice.
2.2.15.16	Then the Asuras.
2.2.16.1	The gods conquered the sacrifice.
2.2.16.2	They conquered it again from the Agnidhra.
2.2.16.3	That is the unconquered part of the sacrifice, namely the Agnidhra;
2.2.16.4	for when he moves from the Agnidrá to the Hishnyas, he then makes it again.
2.2.16.5	For the conquest.
2.2.16.6	Those who move to the Bahispavamana indeed go away.
2.2.16.7	At the Bahispavamāna, the Adhvaryu says:
2.2.16.8	"O Agni, spread the fires, spread the sacrificial grass, decorate the sacrificial cakes."
2.2.16.9	They come back, having performed the sacrifice without defeat, and renewing their bodies.
2.2.16.10	At the two Savanas, he spreads (the fires) with embers, at the third Savana with sticks, for the sake of brightness.
2.2.16.11	Thus indeed, it becomes possible.
2.2.16.12	The Rakshas demons tried to harm the sacrifice of the gods from the south.
2.2.16.13	They were killed by the Agnidh priest.
2.2.16.14	Therefore, standing facing south, the Agnidh priest responds.
2.2.16.15	For the victory of the sacrifice, for the destruction of the Rakshas.
2.2.17.1-4	They say, "Why do they offer the oblations at the Soma-sacrifice and not at the Havirayajna?" The Havirayajña is not the complete sacrifice to the gods. But the Soma-sacrifice is the complete sacrifice to gods. Therefore they offer the oblatioṇs at the Soma-sacrifi ce.
2.2.17.5	May I be agreeable to speech, may I be agreeable to the lord of speech. O goddess, whatever is the sweetest of speech, in that do thou place me. Svāhā to speech, svāhā to the lord of Speech, svāhā Sarasvatī, svāhā unto Sarasvatī. Thus he offers with the word svāhā at the beginning.
2.2.17.6	Therefore speech, having been released from that, carries the sacrifice beyond the mind.
2.2.17.7	For the mind is pleased with the mind.
2.2.17.8	Now some offer seven oblations, saying that the seven metres are employed in each mantra.
2.2.17.9	Just as a girdle is worn for the purpose of separating the pure from the impure, so these are placed for the purpose of separation of the pure from the impuṟe, for the separation of the sacrifice.
2.2.17.10	The worlds of the gods are in front of the sacrificial posts, those of men behind.
2.2.17.11	Therefore, those who drink Soma should not approach the posts from the front.
2.2.17.12	Because this is the people.
2.2.17.13	They ascend the world of the gods.
2.2.17.14	Their abode and ascent are the Agnidhra and the Sadas.
2.2.17.15	He who moves without knowledge meets with distress.
2.2.17.16	But he who moves with knowledge does not meet with distress.
2.2.18.1	Prajapati is the sacrifice.
2.2.18.2	In him are all desires, all wishes, all immortality.
2.2.18.3	These are his guardians, the Adhvaryus.
2.2.18.4	One about to enter the assembly hall salutes them.
2.2.18.5	Obeisance, obeisance.
2.2.18.6	For the gods do not go beyond obeisance.
2.2.18.7	They, having been worshipped, release the creator.
2.2.18.8	Then he approaches this Prajapati, the sacrifice, saying, "Obeisance, obeisance."
2.2.18.9	For the gods go beyond obeisance,
2.2.18.10	There the sacrificer attains all desires, attains all desires.
2.2.19.1	He who knows the Gandharvas of the assembly, does not meet with misfortune in the assembly.
2.2.19.2	One about to enter the assembly should say, "Salutations to the observer."
2.2.19.3	For Agni is the observer, and therefore he gives himself up to him.
2.2.19.4	He attains the whole span of life and does not die before his time, he who knows this.
2.2.19.5	Having entered the assembly, one should say, "Salutation to the listener."
2.2.19.6	The wind is the listener.
2.2.19.7	Therefore, he gives himself to him.
2.2.19.8	He attains the full span of life and does not die before old age, he who knows this.
2.2.19.9	One should say while entering the assembly hall, "Salutations to the announcer."
2.2.19.10	The sun is the announcer.
2.2.19.11	Therefore, one gives oneself to him.
2.2.19.12	One attains the full span life and does not dies before old age, one who knows this.
2.2.19.13	The one who has entered the assembly should say, "Salutations to the observer."
2.2.19.14	The observer is either a brahmin.
2.2.19.15	He then gives himself to him.
2.2.19.16	One who knows this attains the full span of life and does not die before old age.
2.2.19.17	Those who are present are the Gandharvas.
2.2.19.18	One who enters the assembly without knowing these Gandharvas present incurs the misfortune of those present.
2.2.19.19	Now he who moves with knowledge does not suffer any harm from the members of the assembly.
2.2.19.20	By this, indeed, the Angirases used to proclaim the entire assembly.
2.2.19.21	They do not suffer any harm at the hands of the members of the Assembly.
2.2.19.22	Now he for whom one may desire that he should not suffer any harm by the members of the Assebly, to him one should proclaim the entire assembly by this.
2.2.19.23	He does not suffer any injury at the hands of members of the Assembly.
2.2.19.24	Now if one should desire of a man, 'May he die', then one should exclude him from these (sacrifices).
2.2.19.25	He dies.
2.2.20.1	They say, 'The sacrifice is dedicated to Indra, then why are only two, the Hotṛ and the Brahmanācchaṃsin, who have set out for the morning pressing, seen to offer to Indra?
2.2.20.2	The Hotṛ offers, 'This is your sweet Soma.'
2.2.20.3-9	We, O Indra, thee, the bull, thus says the Brahmanachchhaṃsin. The others with hymns addressed to different deities. How do they become hymns addressed to Indra? We call Mitra, thus says the Maitrāvaruṇa. Varuṇa, the drinker of Soma, thus says the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin. Whatever is drunk is the form of Indra. He pleases Indra by that.
2.2.20.10	The Maruts are his (Indra's) wealth, thus the Hotri priest offers.
2.2.20.11	He is the best of the protectors of cattle.
2.2.20.12	Indra is the protector of cattle.
2.2.20.13	That is the form of Indra.
2.2.20.14	By that he pleases Indra.
2.2.20.15	O Agni, bring your wives here, thus the Neshtri priest offers. (The Hotri says)
2.2.20.16	Those who drink Soma are Tvashtri.
2.2.20.17	Whatever is drunk is the form of the Indra.
2.2.20.18	By this he pleases Indra. 
2.2.20.19	The Agnidhra priest offers with the formula, "To the one who is the lord of the Uksas, to the one who is lord of the Vasas."
2.2.20.20	"To the one who has Soma as his back, to the one with the power of penetration."
2.2.20.21	Indra is the one with the penetrating power.
2.2.20.22	This is the form of Indra.
2.2.20.23	By this he pleases Indra.
2.2.20.24	"Come to us with the morning hymns, with the gods, with the Janyas, with the Vasus, Indra and Agni, the drinkers of Soma."
2.2.20.25	The Svayam-samrddha is the Acchāvāka's.
2.2.20.26	Thus indeed they become Indra-related.
2.2.20.27	By being of different deities, he pleases the other deities.
2.2.20.28	By being in the Gāyatrī metre, they are related to Agni.
2.2.20.29	Therefore, by these (verses) one attains the three (worlds).
2.2.21.1	All of them indeed perform the midday pressing with the Indra-related verses.
2.2.21.2	Some perform with the verses containing the word 'abhitṛṇṇavati'.
2.2.21.3	"Drink the Soma, O thou fierce one, who hast struck down the foe," thus the Hotri offers.
2.2.21.4	"Protect him, O thou who art strong and victorious," thus the Maitrāvaruṇa.
2.2.21.5	"Protect, as of old, he who is thy friend," thus the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin.
2.2.21.6	"Come hither, they call thee, O thou who lovest Soma," thus the Potā.
2.2.21.7	"This Soma is thine, come hither," thus the Neṣṭṛ.
2.2.21.8	"The Soma-pressers, knowing Indra, have pressed the Soma for Indra." Thus says the Acchāvāka.
2.2.21.9	"The pot is filled with Soma. Svāhā!" Thus says the Agnīdhra.
2.2.21.10	Thus indeed they are placed in between.
2.2.21.11	Indra did not conquer the morning pressing.
2.2.21.12	He conquered the midday pressing with these (verses).
2.2.21.13	Now, because they have covered the midday pressing with these (verses), therefore they are called 'covered'.
2.2.22.1	They say, 'If the third pressing is dedicated to Indra and the Rbhus, then why does he offer to Indra and the Rbhus alone, when all the offerings at the third pressing are dedicated to Indra and Rbhus?'
2.2.22.2	The Hotri alone says, 'Indra, with the Rbhus, the strong, has been pressed.'
2.2.22.3	The others with various deities.
2.2.22.4	How do they become connected with Indra and Arbu?
2.2.22.5	"The Maitrāvaruṇa priest offers, saying, "Indra and Varuna, the two well-purified ones, have drunk this Soma."
2.2.22.6	"Your chariot is the sacrificial session, the divine assembly." There are many vehicles.
2.2.22.7	That is the form of the Rbhus.
2.2.22.8	The Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin priest offers, saying "Indra and Brihaspati drink Soma."
2.2.22.9	May the drops enter us, born of ourselves. Many are the horses.
2.2.22.10	This is the form of the Rishis.
2.2.22.11	May the seven-steeds carry you, the swift-moving. The priest offers.
2.2.22.12	The swift-moving ones have conquered with their arms. Many are the vehicles.
2.2.22.13	This is also the form of the Risis.
2.2.22.14	Come to us, O good-inviter, for the invitation. The Hotri offers.
2.2.22.15	For the invitation. Many are the invitations.
2.2.22.16	That is the form of the Rbhus.
2.2.22.17	"The Acchāvāka priest chants, "Indra-Vishnu, drink the honey of this (Soma)."
2.2.22.18	"The many streams of your wine have reached us." The many streams of your
2.2.22.19	That is the form of Rbhus. "
2.2.22.20	The Agnidhra priest chants, "This praise is worthy of the all-knowing one."
2.2.22.21	"We have united like a chariot with the sage." The many streams
2.2.22.22	That is the form of the Rbhus.
2.2.22.23	Thus indeed, these (verses) become connected with Indra and the Rbhus (gods).
2.2.22.24	By (their) being of different deities, he pleases other deities.
2.2.22.25	The verses are of the Jagat metre. The third pressing is indeed of the Jagat (metre).
2.2.22.26	For the completion of the third pressing.
2.2.23.1	They speak words full of discernment, full of knowledge.
2.2.23.2	They discern the Brahman.
2.2.23.3-8	They speak the truth. They say, "This is the truth among men, namely, the eye." Therefore they say, "He who tells us, he saw." When he says, "I saw," they believe him. If he himself has seen it, then he believes many people.
2.2.23.9	Therefore, they speak words that are wise and truthful.
2.2.23.10	Their speech is indeed truthful.
2.2.24.1	The Darsha-Pūrnamāsa sacrifices are indeed the remembered sacrifices.
2.2.24.2	Which gods come to whose sacrifice?
2.2.24.3	This is a common day for many sacrificers.
2.2.24.4	Therefore one should take up the deities on the previous day.
2.2.24.5	He for whom the deities are taken up on the previous day, his sacrifice comes on the next day.
2.2.24.6	Therefore one should recite four verses of Vihavya.
2.2.24.7	Those who know the sacrifice think that the sacrifice is the Soma, the sacrifice is the truth.
2.3.1.1	"Oṃ! The Vasat-kāra is indeed the divine vessel."
2.3.1.2	When he makes the Vasat-utterance, he thus satisfies the deities with the divine vessel.
2.3.1.3	And when he satisfies the deities that are about to be satisfied, he thus satisfies them in the same way as when he makes the Anuvṣat-utterance.
2.3.1.4	Just as one feeds horses or cows again and again, so also the deities are fed when one pronounces the Anuvṣṭakāra.
2.3.1.5	They say that one worships these fires, the Dhishnyas.
2.3.1.6	Why is it that one offers in the eastern fire and pronounces the Vṣṭakāra in the eastern fire?
2.3.1.7	When he says, "O Agni, do thou take the Soma," he does so with the Vasat-call. He pleases the Dhishnyas.
2.3.1.8	They say that the Soma which has been consumed is finished when one does not say "Vasat" at the end.
2.3.1.9	They say, "What is the share of the Svishtakrit in Soma?"
2.3.1.10	When he says, "O Agni, do thou take the Soma," and pronounces the Anuvṣat-karana, then they say, "He is consuming the Soma that has been settled."
2.3.1.11	This indeed is the Svishtakrit portion of the Soma when one pronounces the Anūṣat-karara.
2.3.2.1	The Vasat-karaṇa is indeed the thunderbolt.
2.3.2.2	One should pronounce the Vasat-karana while mentally thinking of the one whom one hates.
2.3.2.3	He places that thunderbolt in it.
2.3.2.4	He makes the offering with "Six!"
2.3.2.5	There are six seasons.
2.3.2.6	For the attainment of the seasons.
2.3.2.7	He makes an offering with "Vauṣaḍ!"
2.3.2.8	Indeed, the seasons are six.
2.3.2.9	He places that in the seasons.
2.3.2.10	It is established in the seasons.
2.3.2.11	Now indeed did Vaideha say: "He establishes these six in this way."
2.3.2.12	Heaven is established in space.
2.3.2.13	Space is established in the earth.
2.3.2.14	The earth is established in the waters.
2.3.2.15	The waters are established in truth.
2.3.2.16	Truth is established in Brahman.
2.3.2.17	Brahman is established in austerity.
2.3.2.18	These indeed are the established deities. Those who are established, all this follows.
2.3.2.19	He who knows this stands firm with offspring and cattle.
2.3.3.1	There are three kinds of Vasat-utterance:
2.3.3.2	The thunderbolt, the covering of the abode, and the empty one.
2.3.3.3	When he utters the Vasat-utterances loudly, that is the thunderbolt.
2.3.3.4	He strikes him with that, the enemy, the rival, the one who has concealed himself from him, the one who is concealed.
2.3.3.5	Therefore, one should offer the Vasat-call to him who has enemies.
2.3.3.6	Then, he who is equal, continuous, and has the power to destroy, and has the ability to destroy the houses (of his enemies),
2.3.3.7	To him, the subjects and cattle stand in the marshes.
2.3.3.8	Therefore, one who desires subjects and cattle should offer the Vashat-call to him.
2.3.3.9	Then, the one by whom one commits six faults is empty.
2.3.3.10	He impoverishes himself, he impoverishes the sacrificer.
2.3.3.11	The one who utters the Vasat-call is worse, and the one to whom the Vasat-calling is done is worse.
2.3.3.12	Therefore, one should not go to his house.
2.3.3.13	"He who is his Vasat-caller, he says, "Does he take away the evil of the sacrificer?"
2.3.3.14	Herein, one should do as one wishes.
2.3.3.15	If one wishes that he may be as he was when he was born, then one should say the Arci-verse as he was born and then say the Vasat-verse.
2.3.3.16	One makes him the same.
2.3.3.17	If one wishes that he should be worse, then one should recite the Arci-verses higher and the Vasat-verses lower.
2.3.3.18	He thereby makes him worse.
2.3.3.19	If one wishes, "May he be better," one should say the Arci-invocation in a lower tone and the Vasat-invocation in a higher tone.
2.3.3.20	He thereby makes him better.
2.3.3.21	He thereby places him in prosperity.
2.3.4.1	If the oblation has been taken for a deity, one should mentally contemplate that deity and then utter the Vasat-utterance.
2.3.4.2	He pleases the deity directly.
2.3.4.3	He directly embraces the deity.
2.3.4.4	The Vasat-utterance is continuous with the verse.
2.3.4.5	For continuity.
2.3.4.6	He who knows this is united with offspring and cattle.
2.3.5.1	The Vashat-utterance is indeed the thunderbolt.
2.3.5.2	It is indeed this hurled thunderbolt that is not yet pacified, it blazes. Not all know its peace and stability.
2.3.5.3	Therefore, even now, death seems to be more abundant.
2.3.5.4	For him, indeed, this is the peace, this is the support, that is speech.
2.3.5.5	Having uttered the Vasat-call, he recites the formula, "Speech."
2.3.5.6	"May the Vasat-sound not injure me, and may I not injure you. I invoke with the great mind, with the vital breath, the body is established. Go to the support, may it not go away from the support."
2.3.5.7	He should recite the verse, "This is indeed a long-lasting, powerful, and strong Ojas. Ojas is indeed strong."
2.3.5.8	Ojas and Sahas are the two most beloved forms of the Vasatkara.
2.3.5.9	By means of those two beloved forms, one prospers.
2.3.5.10	One prospers with a beloved form, he who knows this.
2.3.6.1	Speech and the Prāṇāpānas are the Vasatkara.
2.3.6.2	They go out at each Vasat-call.
2.3.6.3	He recites over them, "Speech, strength, strength in me, the in-breath and the out-breath."
2.3.6.4	He thus establishes speech and the in-breath, the out-breath in the Hotri.
2.3.6.5	He attains the whole life.
2.3.6.6	He who knows this does not die before his time.
2.3.6.7	May Bhava be auspicious to us. O Soma, thou hast drunk the heart. Like a father to his son, thou art gracious. Like a friend to his friend, thou art bountiful, O Soma, thou art wise, thou art liberal. Thou art the protector of life. Thou art the preserver of life. Thus he touches himself.
2.3.6.8	He is the lord, and if not touched, he is not worthy to take away the sacrificer's life. Let him not eat.
2.3.6.9	When he touches it with this (verse), he thereby restores life to him.
2.3.6.10	With two verses, "Grow thou, may thy streams grow", they fill the cups, with two similar verses.
2.3.6.11	What is similar at a sacrifice, that is prosperous.
2.3.7.1	The Rtuyaajas are the vital airs.
2.3.7.2	When they perform the rites of the seasons, they place the vital airs in the sacrificer.
2.3.7.3	They perform the rites of six seasons.
2.3.7.4	They place the vital air in the sacrificer
2.3.7.5	They perform the rite of four seasons.
2.3.7.6	They put the out-breath in the sacrificer,
2.3.7.7	twice in the rite of two seasons.
2.3.7.8	They thus place the through-breath in the Sacrificer.
2.3.7.9	And that is divided into three parts, Prāṇa, Apāna, and Vyāna.
2.3.7.10	And then it is multiplied elsewhere.
2.3.7.11	Thus the sacrificer, having reached the whole life, attains in this world.
2.3.7.12	He attains immortality, the imperishable heaven.
2.3.7.13	Those very are the breaths, namely the seasonal sacrifices.
2.3.7.14	Therefore they sacrifice without interruption.
2.3.7.15	For the continuity of the vital airs.
2.3.7.16	For the vital airs are continuous, as it were.
2.3.7.17	Or the seasonal offerings are the seasons.
2.3.7.18	The Anuvṣṭakāra is the completion.
2.3.7.19	If one were to perform the Anuvṣṭaka here, he would establish the seasons which are not established.
2.3.7.20	If someone were to say there, "He has established the seasons which are unestablished, it will be difficult to bear," it would always be so.
2.3.9.1	Prajapati, when he created the creatures, created them in the form of the Hina.
2.3.9.2	He created them with the Hina. He created them with the Hiṅkāra.
2.3.9.3	The creatures entered the horse. When the oblations are cooked, when Soma is pressed, when an animal is offered, then indeed this is bound.
2.3.9.4	By the sound of "hiṃ" Prajapati smells the sacrifice that has been destroyed for the sake of the sacrifice not being destroyed, for the attainment of the sacrifice, for the strength of the sacrifice.
2.3.9.5	Therefore, one is killed.
2.3.9.6	Therefore, he who protects his sons becomes the best.
2.3.9.7	For Prajapati smells him.
2.3.9.8	Whatever is the egg that the female bird sits on, and does not hatch, that she also makes a hissing sound.
2.3.9.9	And indeed they say that the great sage saw this song at the beginning of the sacrifice.
2.3.9.10	This is the song at the beginning, namely, the hissing sound.
2.3.9.11	The gods and the sages said, "Let him be called Vasishtha, because he came to our sacrifice and sang first."
2.3.9.12	That is why the hymn is called "Yajnasya Agre Geyam" (Hymn of the Sacrifice).
2.3.9.13	Then he became the foremost of the gods.
2.3.9.14	He who is the foremost, he is Vasishtha.
2.3.9.15	Therefore, the Brāhmaṇa who is Vasīṣṭha should not be excluded from the Dakṣiṇā.
2.3.9.16	For then he is pleased and gives a gift.
2.3.9.17	Then the gods and the sages saw the Ṛg and Sāman verses. They saw them.
2.3.9.18	They milked him of all his milk from where they saw him.
2.3.9.19	Those who are milked and exhausted are the Ṛk and Sāman.
2.3.9.20	They are indeed milked by the sound of "hiṃ".
2.3.9.21	The Ṛk and the Sāman are milked by the "hiṃ" sound, and they yield milk for the sacrificer.
2.3.9.22	Therefore, the Adhvaryus sprinkle the Soma with the sound of "Hiṃ".
2.3.9.23	The Udgātṛs praise with the Sāman with the sound of “Hiṃ”.
2.3.9.24	Having uttered "Hiṃ", they perform the office of the priests.
2.3.9.25	Having uttered "Hiṃ," the Atharvaṇas perform the office of Brahman.
2.3.9.26	Therefore, one utters "Hiṃ".
2.3.9.27	Prajapati himself smells it.
2.3.9.28	And indeed they say, "Only one bears the vow of Prajapati, namely the cow.
2.3.9.29	All the animals, both domestic and wild, live on that.
2.3.12.1	Now, the morning Soma-pressing of the one-day (rite).
2.3.12.2	Prajapati, while performing the sacrifice, was surrounded by Death with the noose of death at the Bahispavamāna (pressing).
2.3.12.3	He resorted to the ghee with the Agniya Gayatri verse.
2.3.12.4	Death, seeing him, surrounded Prajapati.
2.3.12.5	He sat down in the Sama-saman.
2.3.12.6	He went to the Vayu-saman in the form of a Prāga.
2.3.12.7	Death, seeing him, went around Prajapati.
2.3.12.8	He sat down in the Madhyandina Pavamāna.
2.3.12.9	He went back to the Indra-saman in Trishtup metre.
2.3.12.10	Death, having seen him, went around 
2.3.12.11	He then made the Stotra of the Niskevalya with that very wealth.
2.3.12.12	He spread it.
2.3.12.13	Therefore, he who spreads it first, he who knows this, spreads it.
2.3.12.14	Death fled to a place without a gap, the other one proclaimed the Niskevalyam.
2.3.13.3	They, being united and strong, are the Prashas for the Mṛtyu-atya sacrifice.
2.3.13.4	They, indeed, brought this part of the sacrifice to completion.
2.3.13.5	Therefore, the Maitrāvaruṇa recites the Maitrāvaruṇī verses at the morning pressing.
2.3.13.6	They, in fact, brought this part to completion.
2.3.13.7	The Maitrāvaruṇa recites the verses, "We offer to you, O Mitra-Varuna, at sunrise, with salutations. O Mitra-Varuṇa, with oblations, and with the dawn, together with the rays of the sun." This is recited in the verse.
2.3.13.8	"Come to us, O Mitra-Vāruṇa, for the one who gives gifts." These are the Stotriya Anurūpa verses of the Maitrāvaruṇa.
2.3.13.9	"For you, O Mitra, sing" is the Upavasatha.
2.3.13.10	"For Mitra and Varuna" is the Parayas.
2.3.13.11	"Come, O Mitra and Varuna," he offers.
2.3.13.12	He thus pleases the two deities according to their share.
2.3.13.13	He makes the Vasat-call and the Anuvadat-call.
2.3.13.14	They touch each other.
2.3.13.15	They do not nourish.
2.3.13.16	For the Anarashansa-s do not settle down.
2.3.14.1	Indra said, "You bring this part of the sacrifice to completion, the Brahmanasamciya."
2.3.14.2	"With whom?"
2.3.14.3	"With the sun."
2.3.14.4	They said, "So be it."
2.3.14.5	Having become yoked together and having become strong, they overcame death together.
2.3.14.6	For they brought this part of the sacrificial rite to completion, the Brahmaṇasamciya.
2.3.14.7	Therefore, the Brahman-priest recites the Sūryanya-hymns of Indra at the morning pressing.
2.3.14.8	For they have brought this part of the sacrifice to him.
2.3.14.9	And in that he recites the Sūrṇya-hymṇs of Indra, it is said in the verse, "O Indra, drink as much as you wish, the morning pressing is yours, for your early drinking."
2.3.14.10	Come hither, for thy songs are sweet. Come hither to us, O Indra, for the draught. Thus the Brahman-priest sings the Stotriya and Anurūpa.
2.3.14.11	This is thy praise, O Indra, thou of mighty deeds. Thus the Ukthamukha.
2.3.14.12	The fame of Indra, the slayer of Vrtra, is sung. Thus the Parāsa.
2.3.14.13	O Indra, who knowest the intention, thus the Yajati.
2.3.14.14	Thus he pleases the deities according to their shares.
2.3.14.15	He makes the Vasat-call and the Anuvṣat-call.
2.3.14.16	They touch it directly.
2.3.14.17	They do not nourish it.
2.3.14.18	For the non-despised ones do not decay.
2.3.15.1	Indra and Agni said, "You two have brought this part of the sacrifice to us, the chanting of the Acchāvāka."
2.3.15.2	They said, "Yes."
2.3.15.3	They became yoked together, with strength, and overcame death together.
2.3.15.4	For they brought together the parts of this sacrifice.
2.3.15.5	Therefore the Acchāvāka recites the Indra-Agni hymns at the morning pressing.
2.3.15.6	For they brought together the part of this sacrifice.
2.3.15.7-9	The verses of Indra-Agni are recited in the morning. The verses of Indra and Agni are recited in the evening. The verses of the morning and evening are recited. The verses of Agni and Indra are recited. The verse of Indra and Agni is recited. The verse is recited. The verses are recited. The hymn is recited. The hymn of Indra and Agni. The hymn of Agni and Indra. The hymn of the morning and the evening. The hymn of praise. The hymn of praises. The hymn of praising. The hymn of praised. The hymn of Praises. The hymn of Praise. The hymn of praiser. The hymn of prasers. The hymn of Prasers. The hymn is praised. The hymn is praise. The hymn is praising. The hymn is Praises. The hymns are praised. The hymns are praise. The hymns are praising. The hymns are Praises.
2.3.15.10	Here, one calls out, "O Indra-Agni, come!" This is the circumambulation.
2.3.15.11	One offers with the verse, "O Indra and Agni, come!"
2.3.15.12	In this way, he pleases the two deities according to their share.
2.3.15.13	One performs the Vasat call and the Anuvṣat call.
2.3.15.14	They touch each other.
2.3.15.15	They do not nourish.
2.3.15.16	Because those who are not in the Nārāśaṃsa sacrifice do not prosper.
2.3.16.1	Then they call out four times each: "Let us praise the Stotriya, the Anurūpa, the Uktha, and the Paridhaniya."
2.3.16.2	There are four directions.
2.3.16.3	They establish themselves in the directions.
2.3.16.4	And there are four-footed animals.
2.3.16.5	For the attainment of animals.
2.3.16.6	And the Hotrkas have four limbs at the morning pressing.
2.3.16.7	Therefore, all (the priests) recite the Gāyatrī verses.
2.3.16.8	For the morning pressing is indeed Gāyatrī.
2.3.16.9	All (the priests) offer with verses having the same number of feet.
2.3.16.10	When they offer with verses having same number of feet, it is the end of the offering. The end is the increase.
2.3.16.11	They offer with the end.
2.3.16.12	All (priests) offer with verses containing the word 'madhu'.
2.3.16.13	All of them offer to the goddesses who are endowed with wine, who are endowed with sons, who are endowed (with wine), who are beautiful.
2.3.16.14	What is beautiful in the sacrifice, that is prosperous.
2.3.16.15	All perform the Anuvṣṭakāra.
2.3.16.16	The Anuvṣṭkāra is performed after the Svishtakṛt.
2.3.16.17	(The Adhvaryu) does not interrupt the Svishtakrt.
2.3.16.18	This world is the morning Soma-pressing.
2.3.16.19	His five directions are the five hymns of the morning pressing.
2.3.16.20	He attains these five directions with these five hymns. He attains these five directions.
2.3.17.1	They indeed kill Soma when they press it.
2.3.17.2	When the Dakshina is taken away, it indeed kills the sacrifice.
2.3.17.3	They indeed make the sacrifice prosper.
2.3.17.4	That is the reason for the giving of Dakṣiṇās.
2.3.17.5	The midday pressing is the world of heaven.
2.3.17.6	When Dakṣiṇā is given at the midday pressing, it is for the attainment of the world of heaven
2.3.17.7	One should give much.
2.3.17.8	The sacrificer builds a bridge
2.3.17.9	for the attainment of the heavenly world and the attainment of progeny.
2.3.17.10	He offers on the Garhapatya with two (verses).
2.3.17.11	The Adhvaryu crosses it with the step of the Agni-graha.
2.3.17.12	At the Agni-grahas of the Agni-sthana.
2.3.17.13	The atmosphere by that.
2.3.17.14	When the Dakshina is taken at the Madhyamdina Savana, one goes to the Svarga-loka by that.
2.3.17.15	Gold is in the hand.
2.3.17.16	Then he leads it.
2.3.17.17	Gold is truth.
2.3.17.18	He leads it by truth.
2.3.17.19	In front of the Garhapatya, behind the Sadas, between the Agnidhra and the Sadas.
2.3.17.20	They let loose the cattle towards the north, between the Agnidhriya and the Sadas, and towards the Chaitvala.
2.3.17.21	By this indeed did the Angiras go to the heavenly world.
2.3.17.22	They carry them along the path.
2.3.18.1	He gives it first to the Agnidhra.
2.3.18.2	The Agnidhra is the mouth of the sacrifice.
2.3.18.3	He thus makes that (gift) which is the mouth of sacrifice, by the mouth of sacrifice.
2.3.18.4	He gives to Brahma.
2.3.18.5	Brahma is Prajapati.
2.3.18.6	He thus pleases him with that.
2.3.18.7	He gives (gifts) to the priests.
2.3.18.8	He thus delights them with that.
2.3.18.9	(He gives) to the members of the assembly.
2.3.18.10	He thus redeems the Soma-drink with that.
2.3.18.11	He does not deserve to drink Soma with her. He should redeem her with her.
2.3.18.12	He obtains the world of the gods with her when he gives her to one who has heard the Vedas and is a Vedic scholar.
2.3.18.13	He obtains human world with her when he gifts her to one who is not a Vedic scholar and has not heard the Vedas.
2.3.18.14	He obtains plants with her when he bestows her on one who is not attached.
2.3.18.15	The one he gives to the supplicant is the one by which he conquers his enemy.
2.3.18.16	The one by which he overcomes the Brahmins is the one by fear.
2.3.18.17	The one they reject is the one by the tiger.
2.3.18.18	The one he would take back is the one by a tiger, becoming a tiger, he would devour him.
2.3.18.19	He should take it with another.
2.3.18.20	Then he does not devour him.
2.3.19.1-6	The cow is given to all the gods. By that he attains the dear abode of all the gods. The goat is given to Agni. By that one attains the dear abode (of Agni). The sheep is given to the sheep. By that (sheep) one conquers. When one gives cooked food, one redeems it with meat.
2.3.19.7	Whatever he gives, whether a horse or a chariot, he gives his body.
2.3.19.8	Whatever clothes he gives, he gives Brihaspati.
2.3.19.9	Whatever gold he gives, he makes his life longer.
2.3.19.10	Whatever horse he gives, the horse is solar.
2.3.19.11	By that he attains the dear abode of the sun.
2.3.19.12	At the end, it should be given to the receiver.
2.3.19.13	The receiver is indeed Raudra.
2.3.19.14	He thereby conquers Rudra.
2.3.19.15	If he were to give it to the Pratihartri in the middle, he would be conquered by Rudra in the middle.
2.3.19.16	The Asura Svarbhanu enveloped the sun with darkness.
2.3.19.17	It was Atri who removed it.
2.3.19.18	Atri saw it.
2.3.19.19	When he gives gold to the Atreya, he thereby removes the darkness.
2.3.19.20	Then he places the light above, for the completion of the heavenly world.
2.3.20.1	Now indeed of the one-day (rite) the midday (rite).
2.3.20.2	The Rk and the Sama were indeed in the beginning.
2.3.20.3	That was the name of the Rk.
2.3.20.4	The name of the Sama was Amo.
2.3.20.5	They said, "The Rk and Sama are united, they are born for procreation."
2.3.20.6	The Sama said, "No."
2.3.20.7	"Because of its greater greatness than mine."
2.3.20.8-14	They became two and spoke together. They did not speak in unison. They became three and spoke together.  What they spoke together as three, that became with the three. What became with the three, therefore they praise with the three.  They sing with the three. For the Sama is complete with the three. 
2.3.20.15	Therefore, one man may have many wives.
2.3.20.16	But one woman cannot have many husbands at the same time.
2.3.20.17	When that man and woman agreed together, that became the Sama.
2.3.20.18	That is the nature of the Sama.
2.3.20.19	One becomes Sama.
2.3.20.20	One attains supremacy.
2.3.20.21	He who becomes Sama, that becomes Sama.
2.3.20.22	They censure one who is not Sama.
2.3.20.23	They, having become five and having become five, performed the sacrifice. The invocation, the invocation, the invocation and the invocation, the first, the middle, the last, the last and the last, and the Vasat-utterance. When they, having become five, and having become five performed the sacrifice, therefore they say, "The sacrifice is fivefold."
2.3.20.24	The Paṅktis are the animals.
2.3.20.25	When they unite with the Viraj and the Dasini, therefore they say, "The sacrifice is established in the Viraj and Dasini."
2.3.20.26	When one enters the Brihat, it is because this one who shines is of the Brihat.
2.3.20.27	He thus prospers him with his own form.
2.3.20.28	He makes two or three, taking it back again.
2.3.20.29	For the form of progeny.
2.3.20.30	Two (priests) seem to be in front.
2.3.20.31	Then they are born again.
2.3.23.1	They say, "What deity is the sacrifice?"
2.3.23.2	One should say, "Indra."
2.3.23.3	When the sacrifice is dedicated to Indra, other deities come to their share. They come to the morning pressing, the Marutvatiya pressing, and the third pressing.
2.3.23.4	Then indeed this is only Indra's, what is above the Marutvatiyas.
2.3.23.5	Therefore all praise the pure ones.
2.3.23.6	What are the pure ones, that is the form of the world of heaven.
2.3.23.7	What are pure ones, that alone was the first Soma-pressing, namely the morning pressing.
2.3.23.8	Then indeed this Prajapati fashioned this pressing for Indra, his eldest son, which is the midday pressing.
2.3.23.9	Therefore, at the Madhyamdina Savana, all the Niskekvalya verses are chanted.
2.3.23.10	The Niskekvalya are indeed the form of the world of heaven.
2.3.23.11	The verses that are Niskekvalya, those deities that the Hotri chants at the Pratah Savana, having chanted them, the Hotrashansins chant in succession. The Hotri chants the Maitravaruna verse in the Pranga.
2.3.23.12-18	Both of them are for Mitra and Varuna. The Maitrāvaruṇa priest recites the verses for Mitra and Varunā. The Hotr priest recites the three verses for Indra in the front. Both of them are for Indra. The Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin priest recites the verse for Indra. The Hota priest recites the two verses for Indra and Agni in the front. Both of them are to Indra and Agni. The Acchāvāka priest recites theverse for Indra and Agni.
2.3.23.19	Now, indeed, this is only Indra's, what is above the Marutvatīya.
2.3.23.20	Therefore all the Niskevalyas are sung.
2.3.23.21	What is Niskevalya is the form of the heavenly world.
2.3.23.22	What is the Niskevalya, what is the Niskevala, what is the Niṣkevala, what are the Niskevalas, what is the Nirkevala, what was the Nirkevala? This is said in the verse: "Then Soma became sole, he did not endure the deceit of the goddesses."
2.3.23.23	The Asuras, who were hostile to the gods, were performing the sacrifice.
2.3.23.24	They said, "O Vamadeva, you protect this sacrifice from the right side; Vasishtha from the middle; Bharadvaja from the left side; and Vishvamitra from all sides."
2.3.23.25	Therefore the Maitrāvaruṇa priest does not deviate from the Vāmadevya priest, the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin priest from the Vasiṣṭhya priest, the Āchāvāka priest from the Bharadvājyā priest, and all from the Viśvāmitra priest.
2.3.23.26	These very sages protect the sacrifice for him every day without negligence, he who knows this, he who knows thus.
2.4.1.1	"Oṃ, by what wonderful thing did you come to us? By what do you come to us?" These are the Anurūpa verses of the Maitrāvaruṇya Stotra.
2.4.1.2	"Who is that Indra, the possessor of strength?" is a Barhaspatya Prastara.
2.4.1.3	After that, the Brahman.
2.4.1.4	"The bull, born today, is the leader," is the Ukthamukha.
2.4.1.5	"O Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, I have come to you," is the Parayasa.
2.4.1.6	"O Ushan, be gracious to us, O Suma, O Upaka," is the Yajati.
2.4.1.7	He thus pleases the deity according to its share.
2.4.2.3	The Prastara is indeed cattle.
2.4.2.4	The Svaras are cattle.
2.4.2.5	For the attainment of cattle.
2.4.2.6	The Brihatī is indeed the middle of all the metres.
2.4.2.7	The Madhyandina Sāman is the middle of the Savanas.
2.4.2.8	He makes the middle with the middle.
2.4.2.9	Indra with his rays surpassed the Dāsa, with his rays, thus is the Utkhaman.
2.4.2.10	The Brahmanas have sung forth, the praise of Indra, the hearer. This is the circumambulation.
2.4.2.11	He places it around, saying, "Indra, the bull, the wielder of the thunderbolt."
2.4.2.12	The Vasishthas praise with the Arkas.
2.4.2.13	The Arka is food.
2.4.2.14	He places food around for him.
2.4.2.15	He who is praised, the giver of heroes, the giver of cattle,
2.4.2.16	The Arka is indeed food.
2.4.2.17	And he bestows on him offspring and cattle.
2.4.2.18	"May you protect us always with your blessings."
2.4.2.19	This is the prosperity of the sacrifice, that it is prosperous in form. If a rite is being performed and a verse or a hymn is recited,
2.4.2.20	He who knows this and he who knowing this offers this hymn to the Brahman-priest, attains the end of that sacrifice.
2.4.2.21	He offers with the verse, "The one with the golden locks, the one with the thunderbolt, the bull, the Turāṣaḍ."
2.4.2.22	He thus pleases the deity according to its share.
2.4.2.23	He makes the Vasat-call and the Anuvṣat-call.
2.4.2.24	They touch each other.
2.4.2.25	They do not nourish.
2.4.2.26	For those who do not have the Anarashansa (hymn) do not prosper.
2.4.3.1	"The Taruni (hymn) is seeking the one who has wealth, with the trees." This is the Anustubh of the Acchāvāka.
2.4.3.2	"He is indeed rising up." This is the Barhaspatya Prastara.
2.4.3.3	Its Brāhmaṇa has been explained.
2.4.3.4	"He has indeed increased more and more for the sake of valour." This is the Ukthamukha.
2.4.3.5	This is the first of the offerings for prosperity. Thus is the circumambulation.
2.4.3.6	He takes out the tenth portion.
2.4.3.7	This is the Vedic rite of the fierce Angiras. He does not want to burn the sacrifice while it is being performed.
2.4.3.8	He offers with the verse, "Drink, grow, your own Soma juice."
2.4.3.9	He thus pleases the deity according to its share.
2.4.3.10	He makes the Anuvshada offering after the Vashat offering.
2.4.3.11	They touch it directly.
2.4.3.12	They do not nourish it.
2.4.3.13	For the non-desirous do not decay.
2.4.4.1	Then the Adhvaryu calls out five times, "Let us chant the Stotriya, the Anurupya, the Pragatha, the Ukthamukha, and the Paridhananiya."
2.4.4.2	The Pankti has five feet.
2.4.4.3	The sacrifice is fivefold.
2.4.4.4	All the Tristubh verses are chanted in the Indra-verse.
2.4.4.5	The midday pressing is of the Tristubh metre.
2.4.4.6	All (the priests) offer with verses of the same metre.
2.4.4.7	In that they offer with verses of same metre, the offering is the end, the end is the ascent.
2.4.4.8	They offer the end with the end.
2.4.4.9	All (priests) offer with verses containing the word 'madhu'.
2.4.4.10	All of them offer to the goddesses who are endowed with wine, who are endowed with sons, who are endowed (with beauty), who are endowed with drink.
2.4.4.11	What is beautiful at the sacrifice, that is prosperous.
2.4.4.12	All (the priests) utter the Vasat-call in unison.
2.4.4.13	The Vasat-call is uttered after the Svishtakrt.
2.4.4.14	(The Adhvaryu) thinks, "May the Svishtakṛt not be interrupted."
2.4.4.15	The atmosphere is the midday pressing.
2.4.4.16	His are the five directions.
2.4.4.17	There are five hymns in the Madhyandina Sāman.
2.4.4.18	He obtains these five directions with these five hymns. He obtains these five directions.
2.4.5.1	And when they perform the Upavasana rite after the third pressing, he thereby pleases the Pitrs.
2.4.5.2	The Agnidhra priest offers the Upāṁshu-Pātnīvata rite.
2.4.5.3	The Patnīvata is indeed the semen.
2.4.5.4	The semen is indeed sprinkled as if in a low voice.
2.4.5.5	He does not utter the Anuvṣaṭkāra, lest he should stabilize the sprinkled semen.
2.4.5.6	The sprinkled semen is indeed unstable and prospering.
2.4.5.7	The Anuvṣaṣkāra is indeed a stabilization.
2.4.5.8	Therefore he does not utter the Anuṣṭakāra.
2.4.5.9	The Hotṛ, seated at the end of the Dhishnyas, eats at the place of the sacrificer.
2.4.5.10	The Hotṛ is the share of the wives.
2.4.5.11	The Agnīdhra places the semen in the wives.
2.4.5.12	Progeny is born from the moistened semen. For the begetting of progeny.
2.4.5.13	One becomes endowed with progeny, the begetter of progeny, for propagation.
2.4.5.14	One who knows this is born with progeny, with cattle.
2.4.6.1	Then they offer the Śākalas.
2.4.6.2	Just as a snake sheds its old skin, or a reed its outer sheath, so do they become free from all evil by offering the Śākalās.
2.4.6.3	The grains are in a pot of a Drona measure.
2.4.6.4	They put them in with their hands.
2.4.6.5	The grains stand for cattle.
2.4.6.6	They pour them at the end of the ashes of the Ahavaniya.
2.4.6.7	The Ahavaniya is the womb of animals.
2.4.6.8	They thus place them in their own pen, without being taken away.
2.4.6.9	Then, turning to the left, they sprinkle the Soma plants with water.
2.4.6.10	They place them within the altar.
2.4.6.11	That is the abode of Soma.
2.4.6.12	The Adhvaryu, having filled the cups with water, places them facing north and spreads green grass.
2.4.6.13	When water and plants come together, then the Soma becomes complete.
2.4.6.14	They carry them with the Vaisnavya verse:
2.4.6.15	Yajna is Vishnu.
2.4.6.16	He establishes him in the sacrifice at the end.
2.4.6.17	Now when they perform the substitute of the oblation, they thereby make the divine oblation enter into the human oblation.
2.4.7.1	This (oblation) indeed carries the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer to the other world.
2.4.7.2	If they were to offer it in the Avabhṛtha rite without offering it with curds, it would be as if a corpse were being carried by the wind.
2.4.7.3	Now when they offer him with curds and then bring him to the Avabhṛtha, they make him all of one kind.
2.4.7.4	They collect the prosperity.
2.4.7.5	He offers with the verse, "The god Savitr has become, he is to be worshipped."
2.4.7.6	He collects him all of one form.
2.4.7.7	With three (verses).
2.4.7.8	The sacrifice is threefold.
2.4.7.9	He offers again with verses containing the word 'drops'.
2.4.7.10-19	He thus collects him in all his limbs. He offers with the Sūmya verses. He thus collects him in his own self. He offers five times. The sacrifice is fivefold. He thus wins the sacrifice. Man is fivefold. He thus wins man. Cattle are fivefold. Thus he stands firm in cattle.
2.4.7.20	He who knows this stands firm with offspring and cattle.
2.4.8.1	Indeed, Agni is Yama and this is Yamī.
2.4.8.2	When one strews the altar with plants, one takes possession of Yama's indolence.
2.4.8.3	If one were to go without fasting, they would lead him to the other world.
2.4.8.4	He fasts on the altar, saying, "Yama's indolence, unmeasured, unknown."
2.4.8.5	Having here alone paid off his debts, having become debt-free, he goes to the heavenly world.
2.4.8.6	The Hotṛ says, "I offer to the all-consuming Agni, the all-devouring one."
2.4.8.7	For the non-absence of the sacrificer.
2.4.8.8	If they are seen to be mixed, one should offer parched grains with the Anjali-cup.
2.4.8.9	This indeed is the Vaiśvānara Agni, the one who is offered in the fire.
2.4.8.10	He thus places him in his own womb.
2.4.9.1	Having cooked a cake on four potsherds on the Ekastaka day of the month of Aghara, one should fast with it in the morning.
2.4.9.2	If it burns, it becomes equal to merit.
2.4.9.3	If it does not burn, it becomes equal in sin.
2.4.9.4	It is indeed by this knowledge that the Angirasas formerly performed the long sacrifice.
2.4.9.5	He who, knowing this, offers sacrifice to the Upadrashtri, Upashrotri and Anukhyatri, goes to the other world by means of Iṣṭa and Pūrta.
2.4.9.6	Agni is the Upadrashtra.
2.4.9.7	Vayu is the Upashrotri.
2.4.9.8	The sun is the Anukhyatri.
2.4.9.9	He who, knowing this and offers sacrifice to them, goes to the world beyond by means of Ista and Pūrta.
2.4.9.10-16	This is our lord of the sky, he says. Agni is indeed the lord of the sky. He indeed says to Agni, "Protect this for us." You are indeed our lord of the space, he says. The wind is indeed the lord. He indeed tells the wind, "Protect this." He says, "O god, protect."
2.4.9.17	The god Aditya is indeed the one who protects.
2.4.9.18	He says to Aditya, "Protect us."
2.4.9.19	"This is your birthplace," one should place the fire on the kindling sticks.
2.4.9.20	They say, "If the fire placed on the kindling stick is destroyed, the fire would be lost.
2.4.9.21	It should be re-established."
2.4.9.22	The body of thine, O Agni, that is fit for sacrifice, by that do thou mount me, by that do enter into me.
2.4.9.23	This is thy birthplace. Thus one should place the fires on oneself.
2.4.9.24	This indeed is the birthplace of Agni.
2.4.9.25	He places him in his own birthplace.
2.4.10.1	He who knows the Agniṣṭoma as a day, attains the union and the world of the Agniṣṭomah as a day. He who knows this.
2.4.10.2	He who shines thus, is the Agniṣṭom, he is the Sahna.
2.4.10.3	They should establish him with the day itself.
2.4.10.4	This is indeed called Sahna.
2.4.10.5	One should perform it without haste.
2.4.10.6	Now, because they move without haste at the two earlier Savanas, therefore, nowadays, the villages are mostly turned towards the east.
2.4.10.7	Now, because they move with haste at the third Savana, therefore, nowadays the forests are mostly turned towards west.
2.4.10.8	As it is at the morning Savana, so it is at the midday Savana, and as it is at the noon Savana, so at the third Savan.
2.4.10.9	Thus indeed the sacrificer becomes one who does not die prematurely.
2.4.10.10	They should move without haste.
2.4.10.11	When he rises in the morning, then he shines with the least heat.
2.4.10.12	Therefore one should chant at the morning pressing with the least heat of speech.
2.4.10.13	When he comes, then he shines more intensely.
2.4.10.14	Therefore one chants at the midday pressing with the more intense speech.
2.4.10.15	Then when he has come to the middle, then he shines forth as the strongest.
2.4.10.16	Therefore one should chant at the third pressing with the strongest speech.
2.4.10.17	One should chant thus if one wishes to be the lord of speech.
2.4.10.18	Speech is the weapon.
2.4.10.19	With that speech with which one is able to surpass the others and reach the end, one should proceed.
2.4.10.20	This becomes more excellent.
2.4.10.21	He indeed never sets nor rises.
2.4.10.22	When they think that he has set in the west, he goes to the end of the day and then turns himself around.
2.4.10.23	He makes the day below and the night above.
2.4.10.24	He indeed never sets nor arises.
2.4.10.25	Now, when they think that it rises in front, it goes to the end of the night and then turns itself around.
2.4.10.26	It makes the night below and the day above.
2.4.10.27	He indeed never sets or rises.
2.4.10.28	For he never sets.
2.4.10.29	He who knows this attains union with him and his world.
2.4.11.1-6	Now, then, the third pressing of the one-day (rite). The gods and the Asuras were contending for these worlds. The gods conquered the Asuras. The conquered ones went to the junction of day and night. Indra said to them, "These Asuras have gone to the junction of the day and night. Who will raise me up against these Asuras?"
2.4.11.7	Agni said, "I am."
2.4.11.8	Varuna said, "I."
2.4.11.9	Brihaspati said, "I"
2.4.11.10	Vishnu said, "I".
2.4.11.11	They rose up and killed them at the junction of day and night.
2.4.11.12	Because they rose up and killed at the junction of the day and night, therefore it is called Udaya.
2.4.11.13	He who knows this, indeed, conquers his enemy by rising up.
2.4.11.14	Agni, having become a horse, won the race first.
2.4.11.15	Because Agni, having become a steed, won the race, therefore they offer praises with Agni-related verses.
2.4.11.16	Agni, having become a horse, won the race first. Therefore, the horse is called "Sa-kam-asvam" (together with the horse).
2.4.11.17	When the five deities arose together, therefore, the five deities are praised in the Uktha.
2.4.11.18	Speech is Agni.
2.4.11.19	The breath is Varuna.
2.4.11.20	The mind is Indra.
2.4.11.21	The eye is Brihaspati.
2.4.11.22	The ear is Vishnu.
2.4.11.23	For they, the five breaths, having united, rose up.
2.4.11.24	Therefore, these five deities are praised in the Udgitha.
2.4.12.1	For Prajapati created other gods from these five breaths.
2.4.12.2	Having created all that is fivefold, he set it ablaze.
2.4.12.3	They said, "This father of ours, the sky, has become pale.
2.4.12.4	Let us again raise him up."
2.4.12.5	He stands up after having announced his presence.
2.4.12.6	If one performs a sacrifice for a family that has been purified, one stands up after having declared one's presence.
2.4.12.7	He who is Prajapati, he is the sacrifice.
2.4.12.8	He is raised up by these five breaths.
2.4.12.9	Those who raise him up with these five breaths, they are the five deities praised in the Uktha.
2.4.13.1	They say, "When two deities are praised, Indra and Agni, then why are more deities praised in the uktha?"
2.4.13.2	The Agni-Maruts are within the Ukthas, the Asvins are within the Uktha.
2.4.13.3	One should stand when praising the lesser deities.
2.4.13.4	Why are the most numerous deities praised in the Uktha?
2.4.13.5	There are two Uktha-faces, and that is why there are two.
2.4.14.1	Now, the Uktha of the Maitrāvaruṇa is Indra-Varuna, that of the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin is Indra-Brhaspati, that of the Acchāvāka is Indra-Viṣṇu. Two Ukthas are combined, one Indra and one Varuna, and one Indra-Varuna.
2.4.14.2	Two (verses) are sown, one Indra and one Brhaspati; one becomes Indra-Brhaspati.
2.4.14.3	Two (verses) are sewn, one Indra and the other Vishnu; one becomes Indra Vishnu.
2.4.14.4	Two verses are the opening of the praise.
2.4.14.5	That they are two, two,
2.4.15.1	Now, the Uktha of Indra-Varuna is the one for the Maitravaruna. The verse is: "O Indra-Varuna, drinkers of Soma, drink this Soma, the strong one, O you who are firm in your vows."
2.4.15.2	The third pressing is indeed mine.
2.4.15.3	"Come, I shall tell you, we have gone to Agni, O descendant of Bharata." These are the Stotriya and Anurupya verses for the Maitra-Varuna.
2.4.15.4	The one who holds the thunderbolt, the one who is worthy of praise, the one who has the praise at the beginning.
2.4.15.5	After that, the Brahmana.
2.4.15.6	The Asura who knows everything supported the sky. This is the Varuna Samashanika.
2.4.15.7	Varuna said, "I am."
2.4.15.8	For the praise of the two deities, to avoid excessive praise.
2.4.15.9	Indra-Varuna, you two, for the sacrifice, thus is the Indra-Varuna hymn.
2.4.15.10	This is its eternal praise.
2.4.15.11	He establishes it in its own place, in its own foundation.
2.4.15.12	The gods, having become a pair, conquered.
2.4.15.13	For victory.
2.4.15.14	And also for the begetting of the offspring of the pair.
2.4.15.15	It becomes the Ekapadinī.
2.4.15.16	The Hotṛ performs the Pari-dhana with the Ekapadinî.
2.4.15.17	Where the Hotṛ and the Hotrakas yoke, that is the Samṛddhi.
2.4.15.18	Indeed, the two kings Indra and Varuna were angry at the Adhvara.
2.4.15.19	One should perform only the Parīṣaṃs and only the Sūkta.
2.4.15.20	Only the Sūkta is performed in the two subsequent ones.
2.4.15.21	He offers with "Indra and Varuna, the most sweet."
2.4.15.22	These very deities are pleased according to their share.
2.4.15.23	He makes the Anuvṣat-offering after the Vasat-offering.
2.4.15.24	They touch each other.
2.4.15.25	They do not nourish, for those who do not offer the Anāraśaṃsa-offerings do not prosper.
2.4.16.1-3	Now, the Upavasatha-rite is the first, the Soma-rite is the second, and the third is the third pressing. The Upavasatha rite is the first, the Soma rite is the second, and the third is the pressing. The Brahmanaschin says: "We have praised you, O Agni, the most ancient, who are here and there." The Stotriya and Anurupya are the same.
2.4.16.4-11	For the most powerful, for the great, for the great one, is the praise-opening. The Indra-Jāgata (Sāman). Animals are Jāgata. For the attainment of animals. The third pressing is Jāgata. The form of the third pressing. The Barhaspatya Sāṃśamasa (Sāman) is sung with the words, "The waters, the protectors of the young." Brihaspati said, "I am."
2.4.16.12	For the praise of the gods and for the non-praise of others.
2.4.16.13	"The thoughts of us are good, O Indra, knowing the heaven." This is the Indra-Brhaspati hymn.
2.4.16.14	This is his permanent hymn to Indra-Brhaspatis.
2.4.16.15	He establishes it in its own place, in its own foundation.
2.4.16.16	The gods, having become a pair, conquered.
2.4.16.17	For victory.
2.4.16.18	Then for the sake of the union of the pair and the propagation of offspring.
2.4.16.19	"May Brihaspati protect us from the rear," thus he places the Indra-Brihaspati (bricks).
2.4.16.20	He establishes the sacrifice in Indra and Brihaspati.
2.4.16.21	"May Indra from the north, from the south, from the west, from the east, from above, from below, from the front, from the middle, may Indra, our friend, grant us a boon among our friends."
2.4.16.22	He prays for blessings from all directions, not from the west.
2.4.16.23	The desire that he desires is fulfilled for him, he who knows this and he who knowing this offers this to the Brahman-priest.
2.4.16.24	He offers with the verse, "O Brihaspati, you and Indra, O Vasus."
2.4.16.25	He thus pleases these deities according to their share.
2.4.16.26	He recites the Vasat call and the Anuvṣat call.
2.4.16.27	They touch each other.
2.4.16.28	They do not nourish.
2.4.16.29	For the non-sacrificial ones do not prosper.
2.4.17.1	And when the Uktha of Indra-Viṣṇu is sung by the Acchāvāka, it is recited with the verse, "Indra-Viṣṇus, lords of intoxication, have come to Soma, the bestower of wealth."
2.4.17.2	The third pressing is indeed intoxicating.
2.4.17.3	This is the praise of Indra, the giver of wealth. This is the praise...
2.4.17.4	The season is the mother, and her waters are the praise-opening.
2.4.17.5	Its explanation is given in the Brāhmaṇa.
2.4.17.6	"A mortal may desire to be like you," this is the Vaishnavam Saṃshaṃsika.
2.4.17.7	"I am," said Vishnu.
2.4.17.8	For the praise of the two deities, to avoid excessive praise.
2.4.17.9	"I unite you with your work, I unite you with your power." The Indra-Vishnu hymn is a circumambulation.
2.4.17.10	This is the permanent hymn of Indra-Vishnu.
2.4.17.11	He establishes it in its own place, in its own foundation.
2.4.17.12	The gods, having become a pair, conquered.
2.4.17.13	It is for victory.
2.4.17.14	And also for the begetting of the offspring of the pair.
2.4.17.15	"You both conquer, you do not conquer each other," with this verse addressed to Indra-Vishnu he places (the cake).
2.4.17.16	He establishes the sacrifice of Indra-Vishnu.
2.4.17.17	He offers with the verse, "Indra-Vishnu, drink the honey of this."
2.4.17.18	He thus pleases these two deities according to their share.
2.4.17.19	He makes the Vasat-call and the Anuvadat-call.
2.4.17.20	They touch each other.
2.4.17.21	They do not nourish.
2.4.17.22	For those who do not have the Anarashansa (hymn) do not prosper.
2.4.18.1	Then the Adhvaryu chants, "Oṃ, let us praise." They chant the Stotriya, Anurupya, Ukthamukha and Paridhananiya hymns, each four times.
2.4.18.2	There are four directions.
2.4.18.3	They establish themselves in the directions.
2.4.18.4	And there are four-footed animals.
2.4.18.5	For the attainment of animals.
2.4.18.6	Then the Hotr priests at the third pressing have four parts.
2.4.18.7	Therefore there are four.
2.4.18.8	All recite the Jagatī verses.
2.4.18.9	For the third pressing is Jagatī.
2.4.18.10	Now these are the Tristubh verses.
2.4.18.11	For at the morning pressing and at the third pressing the Hotr priests' verses are as if not recited.
2.4.18.12	The third pressing is indeed the essence of the Soma-pressing.
2.4.18.13	And this is indeed the essence, the Shukriya metre, which is the Tristubh, the unfaltering one.
2.4.18.14	It is for the essence of the pressing.
2.4.18.15	All (the priests) put on the Paridhis with the Samāvatī verses.
2.4.18.16	When they put on the Paridhīs with the Samāvati verses, the Paridhi is the end, the Udaka is the end, and the Saja is the end. He indeed knows this.
2.4.18.17	They offer with the end of the oblation.
2.4.18.18	All offer with the Madhuvati verses.
2.4.18.19	In that they offer with the Madhūvati verses, all offer with the Sutāvati, Pītāvati, and Abhiratī verses.
2.4.18.20	What is beautiful in the sacrifice, that is prosperous.
2.4.18.21	All perform the Anuvṣṭakāra.
2.4.18.22	The Anuvṣṭkāra is performed after the Svishtakṛt.
2.4.18.23	"May the Svishtakrit not be interrupted."
2.4.18.24	The third pressing is this world.
2.4.18.25	It has five directions.
2.4.18.26	The third pressing has five hymns.
2.4.18.27	He attains these five directions with these five hymns.
2.4.18.28	Now, whatever is the form and measure of these worlds, with that form and measure he prospers these worlds. He prospers these worlds."
2.4.19.1	They say, "What is the sixteenfold nature of the sixteenfold (Stoma)?"
2.4.19.2	There are sixteen Stotras, sixteen Sastras, and it is taken up with sixteen syllables.
2.4.19.3	Two syllables are left over from the sixteen-syllable Anushtubh.
2.4.19.4	These are the two breasts of speech.
2.4.19.5	They are truth and falsehood.
2.4.19.6	He who knows this, truth does not harm him, falsehood does not harm him. He who knows this,
2.5.1.1	The gods indeed resorted to the day, the Asuras to the night.
2.5.1.2	They were of equal strength.
2.5.1.3	They did not turn away.
2.5.1.4	Indra said, "Who am I and who are these Asuras? We shall both seek her in the night."
2.5.1.5	He did not find her among the gods.
2.5.1.6	They were afraid of the darkness and death of the night.
2.5.1.7	For the night is like darkness.
2.5.1.8	Death is darkness.
2.5.1.9	Therefore even now one is afraid of the night as if it were greater, having gone only as far as one's own shadow.
2.5.1.10	He indeed followed the metres.
2.5.1.11	Because he followed the metres, therefore Indra and the metres carry the night.
2.5.1.12	He does not go to sleep, he does not go to the front, he does not to the prayer, he does not (go) to any other deity.
2.5.1.13	For Indra and the metres indeed carry the night. 
2.5.1.14	They indeed followed them in turn.
2.5.1.15	The Parāyas are so called because they are recited in turn.
2.5.1.16	This is the meaning of the Parāyas.
2.5.1.17	They recited them first with the first Parāyas, then with the middle Parāyas, and finally with the last Parāyas. They recited them in the first watch of the night, in the middle watch of the night and in the last watch of the night.
2.5.1.18	They said, "In the morning, in the morning."
2.5.1.19	Now, when they said, "You are the one who is in the night," that is why they are called "the ones who are in the night."
2.5.1.20	They are indeed his (Indra's) metres. So it has been said.
2.5.1.21	They indeed protected Indra from the darkness of the night, from death.
2.5.1.22	That is why they are also called "the ones in the night."
2.5.2.1	In the first series of verses, he takes up the first verses again.
2.5.2.2	Whatever was their desire, that he gives them by that.
2.5.2.3	In the middle series of verses, they praise the middle verses again.
2.5.2.4	What were their horses and cows, that he gives to them by that.
2.5.2.5	When they praise the best of the verses, they take up the best of the words again.
2.5.2.6	Whatever clothes, gold, and jewels they had, they take them back with that.
2.5.2.7	He who knows this, he pushes him away from all these worlds, even from the giver of wealth to the haters.
2.5.6.1	Indra killed Visvarupa, the son of Tvashtra.
2.5.6.2	But Tvashtri, whose son had been killed, brought Soma, the enemy of Indra, to be used in a sacrifice.
2.5.6.3	Indra, having made it fit for the sacrifice, drank Soma with force.
2.5.6.4	He became afflicted with all diseases.
2.5.6.5	Therefore Soma should not be drunk without being invoked.
2.5.6.6	The drinking of Soma becomes a cause of his affliction.
2.5.6.7	From his mouth, from his breath, prosperity and fame went up.
2.5.6.8	They entered the cattle.
2.5.6.9	Therefore cattle have fame.
2.5.6.10	He who knows this becomes famous.
2.5.6.11	Then these two, the Asvins and Sarasvati, brought him the Sautrāmaṇi sacrifice for healing.
2.5.6.12	With that they anointed Indra.
2.5.6.13	Then he became the best of the gods.
2.5.6.14	He who knows this and he who, knowing this, is consecrated with the Sautrāmaṇī sacrifice, becomes the best of his own and others.
2.5.9.1	Now, then, about the Aptoiryāma.
2.5.9.2	When Prajapati created beings, he created them as such.
2.5.9.3	Those created ones went away and remained away.
2.5.9.4	They did not return.
2.5.9.5	They were taken up with one Stoma.
2.5.9.6	They exceeded.
2.5.9.7	They were taken up with two.
2.5.9.8	They were (taken up) with all (Stomas).
2.5.9.9	Therefore it is Sarvas toma.
2.5.9.10	They were grasped with one Prstha.
2.5.9.11	They exceeded (the prescribed number).
2.5.9.12	They were taken with two.
2.5.9.13	With all (Prsthas).
2.5.9.14	Therefore it was Sarvaprstha.
2.5.9.15	In the Atirikta Uktha they were restrained with the Varavantiya.
2.5.9.16	Therefore, this is the Atiratha Sukta.
2.5.9.17	Therefore, the Varavantiya.
2.5.9.18	When he obtained it, he obtained it from Aptu. Therefore, the Apto-ryama.
2.5.9.19	They say that Aptu is the offspring.
2.5.9.20	They say, "The offspring is the Aptu." It is said that the offspring should eat the sacrificial grass.
2.5.9.21	Then he performs this sacrifice.
2.5.9.22	This is the eight-backed (Sāman).
2.5.9.23	It is as though in another sacrifice the Visvajit is followed by the Prstha. How is it so here?
2.5.9.24	This is the father of sacrifices.
2.5.9.25	As though those who hate would be under the control of a chief, so do they submit to the chief for the sake of following the food.
2.5.10.1-6	Just as the first of the Udgītha hymns is addressed to Agni, so here also the first is addressed to Agni. The second is addressed to Indra. These two are addressed to Indra. The Udgītha hymn of the Acchāvāka is addressed to Indra and Viṣṇu. The additional Udgītha-hymns are sung on the fourth day. The Udgītha is the cattle.
2.5.10.7	The animals are fourfold.
2.5.10.8	And the animals have four feet.
2.5.10.9	For the attainment of animals.
2.5.10.10	These are the Stotriya Anurupas, the verses with half-verses.
2.5.10.11	The half-verse is indeed a firm foundation.
2.5.10.12	By means of the firm foundation.
2.5.10.13	And of these very Aśvin hymns, two each are recited on each day.
2.5.10.14	The Asvins are the physicians of the gods.
2.5.10.15	Therefore he recites the Asvin hymns.
2.5.10.16	They gave it to the Asvins, saying, "Let it be healed."
2.5.10.17	The Kshetrapatya verses are the concluding verses.
2.5.10.18	Where he was killed, his subjects stood bound, starving and thirsty.
2.5.10.19	He gave them to the distressed ones, as per the field, and offered them.
2.5.10.20	This earth is indeed the field.
2.5.10.21	"We shall be established in this distressed one, at least."
2.5.10.22	The verses of invocation are in the Tristubh metre.
2.5.10.23	Where he was killed, the people, who were hungry and thirsty, were confined and stood.
2.5.10.24	Those very (deities) by these (verses) arranged them in accordance with their own (respective) position.
2.5.10.25	Therefore these are the Yajya verses. Therefore these are the Yājyā verses.
2.5.13.1	Now then, the Paridhānīyā verses.
2.5.13.2	"May we be with the god Varuna" - of the Maitrāvaruṇa.
2.5.13.3	"May (we) have food and wealth" - this world is food, that world is wealth.
2.5.13.4-10	He thereby wins both worlds. "The Brahmanaschanin (chanting the Brahmanas) says, "He has crossed the sky." The third verse is repeated." He thereby wins the heavenly world. "When Indra, in the intoxication of Soma, struck down the Vala, the gods were pleased." Those who are consecrated are indeed desirous of victory. Therefore this (verse) is victorious.
2.5.13.11	He who has risen up, the Angiras, revealing the hidden ones, has driven away the lower one.
2.5.13.12	He wins them by this (verse).
2.5.13.13	The firm and strong supports of the heaven, Indra has not shaken.
2.5.13.14	By this (verse) he wins the heavenly world every day.
2.5.14.2	Then the Maitrāvaruṇa priest performs the rites for one day.
2.5.14.3	By this he does not fall from this world.
2.5.14.4	The Acchāvāka priest performs the rites of the Ahirbudhniya.
2.5.14.5	For the attainment of the heavenly world.
2.5.14.6	The Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin priest performs the rites common to both.
2.5.14.7	Thus he proceeds towards both worlds, this and the other.
2.5.14.8	Then the Ahīna and the Ekāha, then the Agniṣṭoma and the Saṃvatsara, then the Maitrāvaruṇa and the Aśvāvak.
2.5.14.9	Thus he proceeds, both of them, in succession.
2.5.14.10	Then the Hotr priests at the third pressing (of Soma) put on the Ekāha (sacrifices).
2.5.14.11	By that he does not fall away from this world.
2.5.14.12	The Acchāvāka recites with the Āhinīka verses.
2.5.14.13	For the attainment of the heavenly world.
2.5.14.14	If the Hotrakas recite on the previous day, the Hotṛ should recite as he wishes.
2.5.14.15	What the Hotṛ is, the Hotrakas are.
2.5.14.16	The Hotṛ is the vital breath, the Hotrakās are the limbs.
2.5.14.17	This vital breath moves in common with the limbs.
2.5.14.18	Therefore, if the Hotrakas were to chant on the previous day, the Hotri should chant.
2.5.14.19	What the Hotri is, the Hotrakas are.
2.5.14.20	The Hotri is the Self, the Hotrakās are the limbs.
2.5.14.21	The ends of the limbs are the same.
2.5.14.22	Therefore, if the Hotraka were to chant on a previous day, the Hotr should chant.
2.5.14.23	Whatever the Hotr is, the Hotraka is.
2.5.14.24	The Hotṛ places the Sūktas at the end.
2.5.14.25	Then the Paridhānīyas of the Hotrakas are indeed common.
2.6.6.1	They say, how is it that the Hotṛ is of two Sūktas and the Hotrā is of one Sūkta?
2.6.6.2	He who shines yonder is indeed the Hotṛ.
2.6.6.3	He is indeed one only.
2.6.6.4	Therefore he is of one Sûkta.
2.6.6.5	When he is seen, he becomes as if two.
2.6.6.6-14	The light itself is the circle, the rays are the other white and the other black. Therefore, it is two-versed. The rays indeed are the Hotr priests. They are one each. Therefore, they are one-versed. Because there are two colors for each ray, therefore, they are two-versed. The year indeed is the Hotr. It is one alone. Therefore, one-versed.
2.6.6.15	Because the days of him are some cold, some hot, some other, therefore he is Dvyuktha.
2.6.6.16	The seasons indeed are the Hotr priests.
2.6.6.17	They are one by one.
2.6.6.18	Therefore they are Ekathas.
2.6.6.19	Because in each season there are two months, therefore they are Dvisutas.
2.6.6.20	The Hotr indeed is a man.
2.6.6.21	He is one only.
2.6.6.22	Therefore, it is one-verse.
2.6.6.23	When he becomes a man, he becomes otherwise, and then again otherwise. Therefore, it is two-verse.
2.6.6.24	The limbs are indeed the Hotrás.
2.6.6.25	They are one by one.
2.6.6.26	Therefore, they are one-verse. 
2.6.6.27	When each limb shines, it is two verses.
2.6.6.28	They say, "If the Hotr recites two verses, the Hotra recites one verse, and the Hotrā recites two verses. How is that equal?"
2.6.6.29	If they offer to the two-deity deities, and if one says, "The Hotrā recitess two verses,"
2.6.6.30	They say, "When there is a sacrifice, two Hotr-prayers are added to the Agniṣṭoma. How then are the Hotr-prayer not excluded?"
2.6.6.31	"When they offer to the two gods, and if one says that the Hotr-prayer consists of two verses,"
2.6.6.32	They say, "When there is a sacrifice, all the deities and all the metres are nourished by the Agniṣṭoma. With which metre and which deity are the praises offered?"
2.6.6.33	One should say, "With the Gāyatrī metre and with Agni as the deity."
2.6.6.34	The Asuras, while the gods were performing the sacrifice, attacked them at the Yajnaparvan. "We shall slay their sacrifice at the third pressing."
2.6.6.35	At the third pressing the sacrifice was most powerful.
2.6.6.36	"We shall slay their weak sacrifice."
2.6.6.37	They yoked Varuna on the right, Brihaspati in the middle, and Vishnu on the left.
2.6.6.38	They said, "We are each one."
2.6.6.39	"We are not able to do this."
2.6.6.40	"We shall do this together with the one who praises."
2.6.6.41	Indra said to them, "All of you are my second."
2.6.6.42	All of them were Indra's second.
2.6.6.43	Therefore, the Indra-Varuna, Indra-Brihaspati, and Indra-Vishnu are praised.
2.6.7.8	By means of energy and by means of the Kshatra, he thus encloses the animals on both sides. By means of stability, he does not let them go.
2.6.7.9	The Udgātṛs recite the Upaśaṃsya hymn of Indra and Brhaspati.
2.6.7.10	Indra is energy.
2.6.7.11	By means of energy, they thus offer it to him.
2.6.7.12	The Upaśaṅsya hymn of the Udgātṛ is recited in the form of Indra and Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin.
2.6.7.13	Indra means energy.
2.6.7.14	Brhaspati means Brahman.
2.6.7.15	The Ukthas are the animals.
2.6.7.16	He thus encloses the animals on both sides with strength and with Brahman, for stability and non-transgression.
2.6.7.17	The Uktha of the Acchāvāka is sung in the Indra-svaras.
2.6.7.18	Indra is strength.
2.6.7.19	They thus bestow strength on him.
2.6.7.20	The Anusasyas are sung in the Indra and Vishnu-svaras
2.6.7.21	Indra is indeed strength.
2.6.7.22	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
2.6.7.23	The Ukthas are the animals.
2.6.7.24	By means of strength and sacrifice, he thus encloses the animals on both sides and establishes them in the Kshatra at the end.
2.6.7.25	Therefore the Kshatriya rules over the most animals.
2.6.7.26	The one who is the lord, the giver, to whom the Vedas have been given, are enclosed.
2.6.7.27	They sing these Indra-related Jagati verses.
2.6.7.28	Now, indeed, these (verses) are the third pressing with Indra, and these are the pressing of the Gayatri.
2.6.7.29	These are his (Indra's) supporting verses, namely, the Nabhas, the Ne-dist, the Valakhilya, the Vrisakapi, and the E-yama Maru.
2.6.7.30	Therefore one should recite them together.
2.6.7.31	"This seed has been sown together, it has prospered, let us generate it in one way."
2.6.7.32	Those who do not perform these rites together, as if one were to destroy the semen that has been deposited, or to divide the limbs of a child that has been born.
2.6.7.33	Therefore, they should perform them together.
2.6.7.34	"Together, this semen has been deposited, it has prospered, let us generate it in one way."
2.6.7.35	He praises the arts, the divine arts.
2.6.7.36	The art of these is learnt here.
2.6.7.37	An elephant, a pot, a garment, gold, a horse, a chariot, and an art.
2.6.7.38	One who knows this learns the art.
2.6.7.39	Whatever art one praises, that is the form of heaven.
2.6.7.40	Whatever art is self-purification.
2.6.7.41	They make it their own.
2.6.15.1	Then he recites the Ahanasya verse, "What is the cause of this, the cause of that?"
2.6.15.2	From Ahanasya indeed, everything here is born.
2.6.15.3	From Ahanasyaiva, everything is born.
2.6.15.4	For the attainment of everything, for the birth of everything.
2.6.15.5	One should recite six verses.
2.6.15.6	There are six seasons.
2.6.15.7	The seasons are the fathers.
2.6.15.8	Fathers are Prajapati.
2.6.15.9	Prajapati is the father of Ahansya.
2.6.15.10	One should praise them ten times, says Sambhavya.
2.6.15.11	The Viraj has ten syllables.
2.6.15.12	The sacrifice is Viraj.
2.6.15.13	The embryos live on it.
2.6.15.14	Sri is Viraj. The Viraj is the sacrifice.
2.6.15.15	Glory is food.
2.6.15.16	He thus establishes glory, Viraj, in fame and food.
2.6.15.17	All this stands firm following her.
2.6.15.18	He who knows this stands firm with offspring and cattle.
2.6.15.19	One should recite three verses, says Vatsa.
2.6.15.20	The semen is deposited in three ways: the egg, the shell, and the placenta.
2.6.15.21	The mother and father are the three supports. What is born is the third.
2.6.15.22	It is indeed a false statement that one should recite the fourth verse.
2.6.15.23	Some say that one should recite all the sixteen verses.
2.6.15.24	One who is passionate indeed sprinkles semen.
2.6.15.25	From the sprinkled semen, offspring are born. For the begetting of offspring.
2.6.15.26	One becomes endowed with offspring, one who begets offspring, for propagation. One is born with offspring and cattle, he who knows this.
2.6.16.1	Then he recites the Dādhīkriya verse, "I have performed for Dādhīkṛti."
2.6.16.2	Then he recites the Pavamāna verses beginning with "The Soma juices are the sweetest."
2.6.16.3	The Dādhīkiriya verse is food.
2.6.16.4	The Pavamāna verses are the purifying.
2.6.16.5	Some indeed recite the Pavamāna verse first and then the Dādhrīkriya verse, saying, "This is the food-giving speech of him who purifies."
2.6.16.6	He should not do it like that.
2.6.16.7	Speech is indeed destroyed by eating.
2.6.16.8	He recites the Pavamāna hymns after reciting the Dādhīkriya hymn first.
2.6.16.9	When he recites the Dādhrīya hymn, he speaks speech in the form of speech.
2.6.16.10	He purifies speech with the divine purifier.
2.6.16.11	It becomes Anushtubh.
2.6.16.12	Speech is Anushtubh.
2.6.16.13	He purifies his speech with the same metre.
2.6.16.14	He recites them in half-verses for stability.
2.6.16.15	Then he recites the Pavamana hymns.
2.6.16.16	The Pavamana hymns are indeed purifying.
2.6.16.17	This speech spoke to the speech of the past.
2.6.16.18	He purifies his voice with the Pavamana verses.
2.6.16.19	They all become Anushtubh.
2.6.16.20	Speech is Anushtubh.
2.6.16.21	He purifies his speech with the same metre.
2.6.16.22	He recites them in half-verses for stability.
2.6.16.23	He recitess this verse of Indra and Brhaspati: "A drop has stood on the shining one."
2.6.16.24	This is indeed the abandoned one.
2.6.16.25	Now, some say that the last verse of the Indra-Brhaspati hymn is to be recited as the Indra-Agni hymn.
2.6.16.26	One should not do so.
2.6.16.27	The Indra-Brhaspatis are the abode of the Tristubh metre. The Hotrkas are the abode of this speech.
2.6.16.28-31	Now, when he recites the last verse of the Indra-Brhaspati hymn and the last verse of Indra-Agni hymn, then he pleases him in his own abode, in his own deities. One may always recite it as one pleases. One may recite the last verse of a verse as one pleases. This is said: One should recite on the sixth day, one should not recite.
2.6.16.32-39	How does one praise the other days? How does one not praise them here? They say, one should not praise at all. The sixth day is indeed the heavenly world. The heavenly world is indeed not a place of rest. Some say, one pacifies the heavenly world. Therefore, one does not praise. Whatever one does not praise, that is the form of the heavenly world.
2.6.16.40	The hymns which are recited here are those of the Valakhilyas, the Vrsakapi, and the Evyayamarut.
2.6.16.41	Therefore one should not recite them.
2.6.16.42	Vrsakapi is connected with Indra.
2.6.16.43	All the metres are included in the Aitashprapa.
2.6.16.44-46	The third pressing is connected with Indra and Brhaspati. The third pressing is the third pressing. The third pressing. The verse is connected with Indra-Brhaspati. The verse is the verse. The verse. The verse is recited in the third pressing. Translation: The third pressing is related to Indra and Brhaspatī. The third pressing, the third pressing. That which is the verse related to Indra and Bṛhaspati is recited in the last pressing. The verses related to Indra and Bhṛgu are recited in the last pressings. The verses related Indra and Bhṛgū are recited in the third pressings. The third pressing belongs to Indra and Bhārhaspatya. The third pressing.
2.6.16.47	The people are peaceful and well-settled. Where one praises thus, where one praises thus, that is the Brahman.

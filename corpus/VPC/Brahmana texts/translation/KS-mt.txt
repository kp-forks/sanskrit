6.1.1	Prajapati was this (universe).
6.1.2	From him Agni was generated.
6.1.3	It flowed upwards from his head.
6.1.4	What was the blood of that (Agni), that was scraped off.
6.1.5	That was placed on the earth.
6.1.6	From that the Udumbara was born.
6.1.7	Therefore it is cooked with blood.
6.1.8	It ran eastwards.
6.1.9-15	His own speech said to him, "Offer!" He touched it from here. He offered it with "Svāhā." Therefore this is the offering. His own speech said to it, "Offer!" Therefore there is no hair on the forehead or on the hands. Therefore the ladle is the size of an arm-span.
6.1.16-22	He offered that to the eye itself. To the sun itself. "In the fire, light, light in the fire." He offered light to light. Brahma offered, truth offered. He offered that to the sun itself. For this is indeed the Agnihotra.
6.1.23	He who offers the Agnihotra thus, becomes better and better every day.
6.1.24	Before the day and night came into existence,
6.1.25	they were created together by this offering.
6.1.26	When one offers in the evening,
6.1.27	one sends one's rival away.
6.1.28	When one makes the offering in the morning,
6.1.29	one sends oneself back.
6.1.30	The Agnihotra is offered for the protection of Agni.
6.1.31	By what he offers in the evening, he delights him with the night.
6.1.32	By what he offers in morning, with the day.
6.1.33	This is the first offering to Agni, namely, the Agnihotra.
6.1.34	Therefore all offerings are offered in Agni.
6.1.35	Now this is called Agnihotra.
6.1.36	Agnihotra indeed is the name.
6.1.37	There is no one else among the equals who is more powerful than he for whom the Agnihotra is offered in this way.
6.2.1	He did not like it.
6.2.2	He ran away.
6.2.3	He offered it in that (fire).
6.2.4	From that offering a man was born.
6.2.5	He did like it.
6.2.6	It ran away.
6.2.7	It offered it in that.
6.2.8	From that offering, a horse was born.
6.2.9	Therefore, the man and the horse, when going in the opposite direction at night, are not easily recognized.
6.2.10	He did not like it.
6.2.11	He ran away.
6.2.12	He offered a sacrifice to him.
6.2.13	From that oblation, a cow was born, a goat was born, a sheep was born, barley was born, and rice was born.
6.2.14	From these seven oblations, these seven domestic animals were created.
6.2.15	He did not like it.
6.2.16	He ran away.
6.2.17	He offered oblations to him.
6.2.18	From that oblation, Spring was born, Summer was born, the Rains were born, Autumn was born, Winter was born,
6.2.19	When the thirteenth oblation was about to be offered, he was afraid.
6.2.20	He approached the west.
6.2.21	He entered through the hand.
6.2.22	Therefore there is no hair on the hands.
6.2.23	This is the place of Agni.
6.2.24	Therefore Agni is generated by churning with the hands.
6.2.25	Therefore when being churned, it takes the hands.
6.2.26	He indeed desires Agni's protection.
6.2.27	Cattle indeed stand near Agni.
6.2.28	Agni is cattle.
6.2.29	Cattle enter him.
6.2.30	He who knows this enters cattle.
6.2.31	He poured that oblation into water.
6.2.32	From that the cold was born.
6.2.33	That is the most cruel.
6.2.34	For it was not born from the burnt or the unburnt.
6.2.35	The oblation approached the waters to burn them.
6.2.36	Then the waters became the thunderbolt to Agni.
6.2.37	Therefore one should not sprinkle Agni.
6.2.38	If one sprinkles, one would worship with the dead.
6.2.39	He placed that oblation in the plants.
6.2.40	Therefore plants grow without being sprinkled.
6.2.41	Animals are superior to plants.
6.2.42	Human beings are superior to animals.
6.2.43	This is the cold ghee that shines for Agni.
6.2.44	Therefore, one should put it in a cold corner.
6.2.45	He gave Agni his own dear abode.
6.2.46	He bestows food upon us.
6.2.47	One who knows this becomes a giver of food.
6.3.1	When the Sun and Agni were in the same womb,
6.3.2	then the Sun rushed upwards.
6.3.3	His semen fell down.
6.3.4	Agni took it from the womb.
6.3.5	He churned it with iron.
6.3.6	When it was being churned, he put it into a cow.
6.3.7	That is this milk.
6.3.8	Therefore, he heats the iron vessel in the fire.
6.3.9	When one offers Agnihotra with milk,
6.3.10	one offers it to that very Aditya.
6.3.11	For this is indeed Agnihotra.
6.3.12	Milk is indeed a bull, and rice-grains are a cow.
6.3.13	Aditya is a bull.
6.3.14	When one makes an offering of Agnihotra with barley-gruel,
6.3.15	He offers that very Aditya.
6.3.16	For this is indeed the Agnihotra.
6.3.17	One is circular, the other is not circular.
6.3.18	What is circular is Asura.
6.3.19	What is not circular is the divine vessel.
6.3.20	Therefore one should make the Agnihotra vessel not circular.
6.3.21	One should not sprinkle with milk.
6.3.22	One should also not sprinkle with water.
6.3.23	If one were to sprinkle it with milk, it would not be sprinkled.
6.3.24	If one were to pacify it with water,
6.3.25	If one were left with a dripping pot, one should sprinkle it with water mixed with that.
6.3.26	That is not sprinkled with milk.
6.3.27	Nor with water.
6.3.28	If one sprinkles it, it is sprinkled.
6.3.29	If it spills over, one should sprinkle with the pot in which the Agnihotra is offered.
6.3.30	This is the same.
6.3.31	It does not go beyond here.
6.3.32	It settles down with this alone.
6.3.33	This becomes its settled state.
6.3.34	One sprinkles with water.
6.3.35	Water indeed stands for sprinkling.
6.3.36	That is the peaceful pair, water and milk.
6.3.37	If while being milked it breaks, one should milk it with another vessel.
6.3.38	That itself is the atonement there.
6.3.39	If it spills while being poured, or if it spills after being poured, one should pour it into another vessel, and then offer it.
6.3.40	That is the atonement there.
6.3.41	If it spills while being carried, or if it is spilled after being carried, or when it is near the fire and not yet offered, one should again carry it, pour it into another container, and then offer.
6.3.42	That is atonement there.
6.3.43	Where it would fall, one should pour water there.
6.3.44	Water is the atonement for a sacrifice.
6.3.45	He atones with water.
6.3.46	One is rejected, another is not rejected.
6.3.47	The rejected one is for one who desires cattle, the not rejected one is for the one who desires brahmic glory.
6.3.48	This is the heat that is rejected, namely the Agnihotra.
6.3.49	When one offers with the not rejected (Agnihotra),
6.3.50	He becomes endowed with brahmic glory.
6.3.51	If one does not obtain milk, one should offer with ghee.
6.3.52	Because that is not to be rejected, it is for the sake of cattle.
6.3.53	The lord, restless, burns the cattle with grief.
6.3.54	The rejected (milk) is for one who desires cattle.
6.3.55	That is peaceful, the union of water and milk.
6.3.56	If one cannot obtain milk, one may offer with barley-gruel.
6.3.57	That is to be sprinkled, peaceful, the couple, for cattle, water and rice.
6.4.1	At the Agnihotra, the husband and wife commit adultery.
6.4.2	If he sprinkles it towards the east, the husband dies first.
6.4.3	If he were to sprinkle it towards the west, the wife would die first.
6.4.4	One should sprinkle it towards the north.
6.4.5	One should carry the full vessel towards the north when both are aging.
6.4.6	Then the equal, then the equal, then most equal, then the best.
6.4.7	His sons prosper in the order of their seniority.
6.4.8	One should raise the equal to the foremost.
6.4.9	Then more, then more, then full, then most, then more.
6.4.10	One's food and drink increase more and more.
6.4.11	The youngest of his sons becomes the steward.
6.4.12-18	He who desires should lead them all to the same age. "He who desires, 'May all my sons attain the same age,' The father of all sons desires prosperity. All of them attain the same age. They do not surpass each other. He leads them to the same age four times. He leads the animals to him who has four feet.
6.4.19-26	He gives him animals with two feet. "He should say, "Give me animals." He should place it behind. Animals are the Gārhapatya, animals are milk. This is the limit of animals. He should not place it behind. The Agnihotra is indeed the oblation. The sacrificer is the oblation.
6.4.27	The oblation indeed removes the sacrificer.
6.4.28	One should place it from the north.
6.4.29	The Agnihotra is indeed impure.
6.4.30	Agni is the purifier.
6.4.31	When one carries the Samidha Agni,
6.4.32	he purifies it by that.
6.4.33	When one offers the oblation in front after placing it behind, one indeed meditates on it.
6.4.34	When one takes the Samidha Agnı,
6.4.35	He thus pleases him and makes him not to be heedless.
6.4.36	From this Garhapatya fire, that earlier fire was produced.
6.4.37	This indeed is Prajapati.
6.4.38	That earlier fire.
6.4.39	He took it from here and having gone forward, offered it.
6.4.40	Therefore, having placed the Agnihotra behind, they offer in front.
6.5.7	He, Prajapati, said:
6.5.8	"I choose the oblation."
6.5.9	"I will make these (oblations) taste good."
6.5.10	He chose this kindling wood.
6.5.11	Therefore, it is one.
6.5.12	For Prajapati is one.
6.5.13	He released them to Agni.
6.5.14	Agni made them taste good.
6.5.15	When this (kindling wood) is placed, the plants taste good for the Agnihotra-offerer.
6.5.16	His food is well-digested, who knows this.
6.5.17	One makes many (offerings).
6.5.18	One should offer both oblations to the kindled (fire).
6.5.19	Only one should be offered.
6.5.20	For the Agnihotra is kindled only once for all the sacrifices.
6.5.21	"Give me life."
6.5.22	"Give me radiance."
6.5.23	"Give progeny to me."
6.5.24	One should place it near the door.
6.5.25	The Agnihotra is indeed creation.
6.5.26	If he does not offer, his offspring would go away.
6.5.27	If he offers,
6.5.28	then his offspring are settled.
6.5.29	Therefore they stand up.
6.5.30	The fire is the light.
6.5.31	The light is in the fire.
6.5.32	One should offer the Agnihotra in the evening.
6.5.33	He impregnates the embryo with the speech of the pregnant one.
6.5.34	He impregnate the embryo with the dual speech.
6.5.35	The sun is the light.
6.5.36	Jyoti is the Sun.
6.5.37	In the morning.
6.5.38	He generates it with the speech of the pregnant one, with the union.
6.5.39	What is known and what is unknown, that is the union.
6.5.40	Whatever is with the Yajus and with the mind, that is the couple.
6.5.41	That is the Ajami.
6.5.42	The evening offering to Agni is the offering to Agni.
6.5.43	The morning offering is to Surya.
6.5.44	Agni is the one who causes to flow.
6.5.45	Surya is the one who generates.
6.5.46	One should offer the evening Agnihotra when the sun has set.
6.5.47	One should offer the morning Agnihotra when the rising sun is visible.
6.5.48	Agni himself causes the sun to rise and places the embryo of the night.
6.5.49	He generates it in the morning with the pregnant and dualistic speech.
6.5.50	This one, being born, is followed by offspring.
6.5.36	Jyoti is the Sun.
6.5.37	In the morning.
6.5.38	He generates it with the speech of the pregnant one, with the union.
6.5.39	What is known and what is unknown, that is the union.
6.5.40	Whatever is with the Yajus and with the mind, that is the couple.
6.5.41	That is the Ajami.
6.5.42	The evening offering to Agni is the offering to Agni.
6.5.43	The morning offering is to Surya.
6.5.44	Agni is the one who causes to flow.
6.5.45	Surya is the one who generates.
6.5.51	He who offers the Agnihotra thus, prospers with offspring and cattle.
6.5.52	This is the post of the Agnihotra.
6.5.53	One should offer the Agnihotra after having skipped the morning oblation.
6.5.54	One thus encircles him.
6.5.55	One should go forward and offer in the evening.
6.5.56	One thus deposits the embryo.
6.5.57	One should return and offer in the morning.
6.5.58	One thus generates.
6.5.59	They say:
6.5.60	One should offer the oblation while advancing.
6.5.61	For by advancing one accomplishes the sacrifice.
6.5.62	What one offers is for the gods.
6.5.63	What one directs is for appeasing Rudra.
6.5.64	What one smears is for the ancestors.
6.5.65	What one eats is for humans.
6.5.66	Therefore the Agnihotra is called "for all the gods".
6.5.51	He who offers the Agnihotra thus, prospers with offspring and cattle.
6.5.52	This is the post of the Agnihotra.
6.5.53	One should offer the Agnihotra after having skipped the morning oblation.
6.5.54	One thus encircles him.
6.5.55	One should go forward and offer in the evening.
6.5.56	One thus deposits the embryo.
6.5.57	One should return and offer in the morning.
6.5.58	One thus generates.
6.5.59	They say:
6.5.60	One should offer the oblation while advancing.
6.5.61	For by advancing one accomplishes the sacrifice.
6.5.62	What one offers is for the gods.
6.5.63	What one directs is for appeasing Rudra.
6.5.64	What one smears is for the ancestors.
6.5.65	What one eats is for humans.
6.5.66	Therefore the Agnihotra is called "for all the gods".
6.6.1	The Brahmanas named Praiyamedhas.
6.6.2	They knew everything.
6.6.3	They knew it together.
6.6.4	They did not perform the Agnihotra together.
6.6.5	One of them offered the Agnihotra once, another twice, and another thrice.
6.6.6	Those who offered once asked those who offered twice and thrice:
6.6.7	"To whom do you offer?"
6.6.1	The Brahmanas named Praiyamedhas.
6.6.2	They knew everything.
6.6.3	They knew it together.
6.6.4	They did not perform the Agnihotra together.
6.6.5	One of them offered the Agnihotra once, another twice, and another thrice.
6.6.6	Those who offered once asked those who offered twice and thrice:
6.6.7	"To whom do you offer?"
6.6.8	It is one only.
6.6.9	He said:
6.6.10	"I offer to Prajapati, to Prajapatis."
6.6.11	Those who offered twice asked him:
6.6.12	"To whom do you offer?"
6.6.13	"To Agni in the evening and to Prajapati."
6.6.14	He said: "
6.6.15	To Surya in the morning and to Prajapti."
6.6.8	It is one only.
6.6.9	He said:
6.6.10	"I offer to Prajapati, to Prajapatis."
6.6.11	Those who offered twice asked him:
6.6.12	"To whom do you offer?"
6.6.13	"To Agni in the evening and to Prajapati."
6.6.14	He said: "
6.6.15	To Surya in the morning and to Prajapti."
6.6.16	Of those who offered three times, the others asked him,
6.6.17	"To whom do you offer?"
6.6.18	He said, "To Agni, Surya, and Prajapati."
6.6.19	They said,
6.6.20	"I offer to them in the evening,
6.6.21	and to them in the morning."
6.6.22	Of those who offered twice, he succeeded,
6.6.23	and became the most prosperous.
6.6.16	Of those who offered three times, the others asked him,
6.6.17	"To whom do you offer?"
6.6.18	He said, "To Agni, Surya, and Prajapati."
6.6.19	They said,
6.6.20	"I offer to them in the evening,
6.6.21	and to them in the morning."
6.6.22	Of those who offered twice, he succeeded,
6.6.23	and became the most prosperous.
6.6.24	He excelled the other two in progeny and glory.
6.6.25	His progeny became equal to that of the other two.
6.6.26	Therefore, there should be two Hotr priests, one reciting the Yajus verses and the other reciting the Mantras.
6.6.27	One attains the same prosperity as the one who attained it.
6.6.24	He excelled the other two in progeny and glory.
6.6.25	His progeny became equal to that of the other two.
6.6.26	Therefore, there should be two Hotr priests, one reciting the Yajus verses and the other reciting the Mantras.
6.6.27	One attains the same prosperity as the one who attained it.
6.6.28	If the fire of the Agnihotra goes out before the evening Agnihotra is offered, one should take the Agnihotra that has been placed on the ground, and run with the eastern fire, and follow it with the Agnihotra.
6.6.29	One should offer it with the Agnihotramantra.
6.6.30	If a learned brahmin is available, he should recite the Uddhara mantra.
6.6.31	One should recite the Udhara mantra with all the verses.
6.6.28	If the fire of the Agnihotra goes out before the evening Agnihotra is offered, one should take the Agnihotra that has been placed on the ground, and run with the eastern fire, and follow it with the Agnihotra.
6.6.29	One should offer it with the Agnihotramantra.
6.6.30	If a learned brahmin is available, he should recite the Uddhara mantra.
6.6.31	One should recite the Udhara mantra with all the verses.
6.6.32	If one has taken away wealth earlier, one should give it back.
6.6.33	One is released from the fault by the unmoving one.
6.6.34	If another fire follows the Agnihotra fire not offered in the morning, one should offer it after taking the previous fire and churning out another one.
6.6.35	That itself is the atonement there.
6.6.32	If one has taken away wealth earlier, one should give it back.
6.6.33	One is released from the fault by the unmoving one.
6.6.34	If another fire follows the Agnihotra fire not offered in the morning, one should offer it after taking the previous fire and churning out another one.
6.6.35	That itself is the atonement there.
6.6.36	If he should hurry, then having first approached the fire, and then having taken it up facing east, he should offer.
6.6.37	That itself is the atonement there.
6.6.38	"The one who does this, "he makes the former fire the later one."
6.6.39	Having churned out the fire elsewhere, and having taken it up, he should offer it.
6.6.40	That itself there is the atonement.
6.6.41	Then, on the next day, one should perform the Isti to Agni Tapashvin, Janadvin, and Pāvakavata.
6.6.42	When Agni is heated, then plants are born, the purifying ones.
6.6.43	He makes the plants, the purifying ones, his share.
6.6.44	He does not know the Garhapatya.
6.6.45	When they do not make it for him, then he follows.
6.6.46	The two paths on either side of it are the New and Full Moon sacrifices.
6.6.47	The path in the middle is the Agnihotra.
6.6.48	Thus, indeed, the Agnihotra-sacrificer and the New and Full-Moon sacrificer shine forth in heaven.
6.6.49	Prajapati, indeed, grasped this altar with his mind.
6.6.50	Whatever he gives there to the Agnihotra-sacrifi-cer, that is for the sacrificial grass.
6.6.51	Just as the Nārāśaṃsa hymns are recited when the Soma is pressed, so does he give when he gives whatever he gives.
6.6.52	In the middle of the sacrifice, heaven and earth are the Sadas and Havirdhāna sheds, the days and nights are the kindling woods, the directions are the enclosing sticks, the sprinkling water is the Prusha, the herbs are the sacrificial grass, the sacrificer is the sacrificial post.
6.6.53	One who is not born should not speak.
6.6.54	Becoming an animal, one is born.
6.6.55	Every day the animals are born, and then the worthy ones.
6.6.56	There is no Agnihotra for a king.
6.6.57	For he kills without the vow.
6.6.58	One should not break the vow.
6.6.59	He should offer on the full-moon and new-moon nights.
6.6.60	For they protect the vow.
6.6.61	The Brahmanas should bring food to his house on the days when he does not offer oblations.
6.6.62	Brahmana is Agni.
6.6.63	He offers it to Agni.
6.6.64	It becomes tasty and desirable for him.
6.7.1	With speech, indeed, men were born. The gods and the Asuras were born with speech.
6.7.2	Whatever the men spoke, that became true.
6.7.3	Those gods and demons said to Prajapati:
6.7.4	"This is the truth."
6.7.5	He established the truth of speech.
6.7.6	"Bhuva, Bhuva, Sva."
6.7.7	What was the fourth, that he placed among men.
6.7.8	This is the untruth of speech, what men say.
6.7.9	"Bhur."
6.7.10	This Agni was created, the Rathantara, the Trivrit, the Gayatri.
6.7.11	"Bhuvar iti" (Thus is Bhuvar).
6.7.12	The atmosphere, the wind, the Vamadevya, the Tristubh, the fifteen.
6.7.13	"Svar iti" (Thus Svar).
6.7.14	Heaven, the sun, the Brihat, the Ekavimsa, the Jagati.
6.7.15	"Bhur Bhuvah Svar Agni Jyoti Jyoti Agni" (Agni is the light, the light is Agni).
6.7.16	One should offer Agnihotra.
6.7.17	This is indeed the truth of speech.
6.7.18	This is the pair.
6.7.19	This is Brahman.
6.7.20	With that alone one offers.
6.7.21	One places these bricks.
6.7.22	Having placed these bricks, one ascends the highest heaven.
6.7.23	One becomes the highest among equals for whom the Agnihotra is offered thus.
6.7.24	One should restrain speech when the Agnihotra is being carried.
6.7.25	Prajapati created beings by means of austerities.
6.7.26	What he did not utter, that itself tormented him.
6.7.27	The Agnihotra is indeed creation.
6.7.28	This is the vow of creation.
6.7.29	He created them with the words, "May they arise."
6.7.30	When they are like drops, then he should look at them.
6.7.31	"May they arise."
6.7.32	May I be uplifted with offspring and cattle.'
6.7.33	The Agnihotra is indeed the uplifting and the prosperity.
6.7.34	He who offers the Agnihotra thus becomes uplifted with offspring and with cattle.
6.7.35	One looks at the Agnihotra with Agni.
6.7.36	The Agnihotra indeed is the begetting.
6.7.37	Agni is the begetter.
6.7.38	One indeed begets.
6.7.39	The Agnihotra is indeed semen.
6.7.40	One should not perform the rite of sprinkling.
6.7.41	One should sprinkle semen.
6.7.42	Not the unsprinkled one.
6.7.43	It should be between.
6.7.44	O Rudra, be pleased.
6.7.45	O Anarbha, be pleased. 
6.7.46	O thief, salutations to you."
6.7.47	Having offered, one should face north.
6.7.48	These are indeed the fierce names of Rudra.
6.7.49	They (the gods) destroy him who, desiring a share in the Agnihotra, injures his subjects.
6.7.50	He (the sacrificer) repels them.
6.7.51	He appeases them.
6.7.52	When this god (Agni) is about to injure his subjects, he should offer the oblation with the verse, "O Jatavedas, do thou come with thy companion, for the oblation on the earth by day, svāhā."
6.7.53	One should offer Agnihotra for twelve nights.
6.7.54	Or the body of Agni Jātavedas, by that he destroys the offspring, desiring to have a share in the Agnihotra.
6.7.55	He pleases her with that.
6.7.56	He offers to her.
6.7.57	That is not a sin.
6.7.58	Of the two offerings, this is the Agni offering, the other is the Agni offering.
6.7.59	They kindle Agni Vaiśvānara for a year.
6.7.60	There is no one who has not offered oblations to this (fire) even in a year, nor to Vaisvānara.
6.7.61	The logs are the months.
6.7.62	The big embers are the seasons.
6.7.63	The smaller ones are the half-months. The crackling is the day and night.
6.7.64	The gold is the light, that is the fire of Brhaspati.
6.7.65	What is neither gold nor red, that is the Mitra fire.
6.7.66	What is red, that is Varuna.
6.7.67	What is smoky, that is Visvedeva.
6.7.68	Where the fire moves like a flame among the embers, that is its mouth, called Avī.
6.7.69	That is Brahman.
6.7.70	One should offer in that.
6.7.71	One eats with the mouth.
6.7.72	The limbs become Avī in the offspring.
6.7.73	He becomes more prosperous every day, for whom the Agnihotra is offered thus.
6.8.1	The Garhapatya is the cooker of rice, the Ahavaniya is the invitation, the Madhyama is the offering to the gods, the Anumantranam is the invitation.
6.8.2	This indeed is the Viraj with five feet.
6.8.3	One attains her.
6.8.4	One obtains her.
6.8.5	He who has obtained this, he becomes the best among men.
6.8.6	If the time for the evening Agnihotra offering has passed,
6.8.7	one should say, "May the faults of the house be destroyed, svāhā!"
6.8.8-16	He should offer. That itself is the oblation there. By that his (oblation) is not passed over. If the time for the morning Agnihotra offering has passed, One should offer with the verse, "To the day, svāhā!" He should offer. This itself is the oblution there. By this his (oblation is) not passed over. One should not say svāhā.
6.8.17	The word "svāhā" is the offering of the Agnihotra.
6.8.18	When speech speaks, then one should offer.
6.8.19	That is the Vaṣaṭkāra of the Agnihotra
6.8.20	"Agni is united with the day and earth."
6.8.21	He pleases those very ones, heaven and earth.
6.8.22	He obtains them.
6.8.23	"United with the god Savitr."
6.8.24	For there is no offering to Savitar that is not true.
6.8.25	"With Pusan, in the sky, together."
6.8.26	Pusan is cattle, the sky is cattle.
6.8.27	He indeed wins cattle.
6.8.28	"With the night, with Indra, together, svāhā."
6.8.29	He indeed offers to the night.
6.8.30	For there is no offering that is not true to Indra.
6.8.31	The gods formerly offered Agnihotra.
6.8.32	Therefore, before that, Brihat and Mahān were born.
6.8.33	"With the Svāhā of Indra, the day, together with the sun."
6.8.34	The day is indeed Bṛhat, the sun is Bṛhat.
6.8.35	This day and sun are indeed conquered and offered to him.
6.8.36	The night is indeed Anushtubh, the day is Trishtubh.
6.8.37	And he offers this oblation both at night and during the day.
6.8.38	"He offers with the formula, "O Agni, Adabhya, do thou accept, svāhā."
6.8.39	He offers the northern oblation.
6.8.40	Just as one offers to Agni, so does he do this.
6.8.41	"O Agni, do thou accept thy own body."
6.8.42	"The heaven and earth are not broken."
6.8.43	"Do thou bestow strength upon us."
6.8.44	Having taken up grass, he strikes (the fire).
6.8.45	This is indeed the settled form of his own.
6.8.46	This is indeed Agnihotra's unpacified form which destroys offspring.
6.8.47	When one strikes (the fire) after taking up grass,
6.8.48	he pacifies it with that.
6.8.49	"O Agni, lord of the house, accept (this oblation) with svāhā."
6.8.50	He offers on the Garhapatya with the ladle.
6.8.51	Just as one performs the Patnīsaṃyājya rites, so does he do this.
6.8.52	He indeed meditates on this.
6.8.53	When he offers into the fire after placing it behind,
6.8.54	when he offers into the Garhapatya with the ladle,
6.8.55	he thereby pleases him.
6.8.56	He makes him not meditate.
6.8.57	The Agnihotra-offering is made in the mouth; the offspring is born in the mouth; he who offers the Agnihotra thus, becomes more and more prosperous.
7.4.1	The Stoma should be employed in the Agnihotra.
7.4.2	He who employs the Stoma in the Agnihotra becomes more and more prosper- ous.
7.4.3	"They approach the sacrifice."
7.4.4	These are the creatures.
7.4.5	They are the Sat-Sat Stoma.
7.4.6	He employs them.
7.4.7-17	"He shines after the ancient (gods). The gods are the ancient ones. They are the Sat-Sat Stoma. He invokes them for heaven. "O Maghavan, do thou come near. "Do thou come near again." This (earth) is the coming near. He indeed stands firm in this (earth) for heaven. Those beings who are to be born, they are the coming near. He invokes them. He indeed invokes them.
7.4.18	"Thy chariot, O Dūdbha, is around thee."
7.4.19	He thus takes hold of the Stoma yoked with it.
7.4.20	"Agni is the head of heaven, the crest."
7.4.21	This is the one with the seed, the one with the animals, the one with two (kinds of) seed.
7.4.22	This is the Gāyatrī that has taken up the burden, the first one.
7.4.23	"Both of you, O Indra and Agni, are invoked."
7.4.24	The sun is Indra.
7.4.25	He enters the fire at night.
7.4.26	Both of them are together in the same place.
7.4.27	That which is the first verse of the Triṣṭubh, that is the first verse in the Triṣṭūb.
7.4.28	“This one here first came with the creators.”
7.4.29	For Agni was first established in this world.
7.4.30	That which was the first verse of Jagatī, that is the Jagatī.
7.4.31	This is your natural place of birth.
7.4.32	This is indeed the natural place of birth of Agni, Agni is the sun.
7.4.33	That which is the Dhura metre, the Anushtubh, that is the Anushtubha metre.
7.4.34	I have done for the one who gives ghee.
7.4.35	This is Agni's animal form, which is the one who gives the ghee.
7.4.36	He takes it up.
7.4.37	The animals are his attendants.
7.4.38	The animal is Agni.
7.4.39	Just as a cow, a horse, or a man ages, so does this (Agni) when deposited.
7.4.40	One should attend to the Agni-installation with verses.
7.4.41	These are his limbs.
7.4.42	He makes him new again with them.
7.4.43	When one attends to (Agni) with verses,
7.4.44	He makes it full again with the same (water).
7.4.45	It becomes as it was before.
7.4.46	He approaches.
7.4.47	This is his union.
7.4.48	This is indeed his self-control.
7.4.49	This is really his begging.
7.4.50	As one approaches one who is better, and salutes him, so does he do this.
7.5.1	One should approach the new moon with the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice.
7.5.2-8	The full-moon sacrifice is the share of Agni and Soma. He gives him over to them. They protect him from going away. The dark half of the moon is for Indra and Agni. The new-moon sacrifice is Indra and Agni's share. He gives it over to them. They protect him from going astray.
7.5.9	Agni and Soma have given him to the former half of the month.
7.5.10	Indra and Agni to the latter half of the month
7.5.11	The gods, knowing this, protect him who, knowing this, worships Agni, without departing from him.
7.5.12	To whom is Agni worshipped?
7.5.13	They say:
7.5.14	This is the true worship of Agni.
7.5.15	He who worships Agni
7.5.16-22	This is the Agnihotra-fire. He worships in the evening, not in the morning. Therefore, in the evening he worships the guest with a gift, not so in the morning. The blessing of the sacrifice is there. When he worships the Agnihotra- fire. He seeks the blessing of the Agnihotra. Prajapati created the creatures.
7.5.23	He created Agni first.
7.5.24	Therefore he assigned to him this share, namely, the Agni-worship.
7.5.25	When one worships Agni.
7.5.26	He prospers him with his own share.
7.5.27	Agni desired to be yoked, as a horse desires a chariot.
7.5.28	When one performs the Agni-worship,
7.5.29	he yokes him.
7.5.30	He who knows this, he who knows this, indeed, obtains his desire.
7.5.31	He who obtains his desire among men, he becomes the more powerful.
7.5.32	He who, knowing this, worships Agni, he obtains, he becomes the powerful.
7.5.33	He approaches.
7.5.34	He indeed prospers by this.
7.5.35	"Agni is the head."
7.5.36	He indeed sprinkles the semen by this.
7.5.37	"Both of you, O Indra and Agni,"
7.5.38	The Prāṇāpāna are Indra and Agni.
7.5.39	He places the Prāṇāpaṇas in it.
7.5.40	"This is the first to be born here."
7.5.41	He places the embryo in it.
7.5.42	Following the ancient light of this.
7.5.43	He makes it the womb.
7.5.44	This is your natural place.
7.5.45	It generates and nourishes.
7.5.46	Those whose offspring are born thus knowing Agni, they are born as if created.
7.6.1	The day was of the gods, the night of the Asuras.
7.6.2	The gods were afraid of the night, of the darkness, of the death, of the Asuras, who were approaching them.
7.6.3	They approached Agni with the metres.
7.6.4	The Vasus are in the Gayatri metre, the Rudras in the Tristubh, the Adityas in the Jagati, the animals are in the water, the men are in the fuel.
7.6.5	Those gods have gone beyond the darkness, the blindness, the death, the night.
7.6.6	When he approaches Agni with the metres,
7.6.7	he goes beyond the darkness, blindness, death, the night,
7.6.8	"Thou art Agni, O Surya, with lustre."
7.6.9	He prays for this blessing on the fires.
7.6.10	"He prays, "May I be united with life and radiance."
7.6.11	He prays for this blessing for himself.
7.6.12	"He says, "May I unite with the light of the sun, O Agni."
7.6.13	He prays this blessing on the fire.
7.6.14	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, "May you be united with the praise of the sages."
7.6.15	The praise of the sages is the metres.
7.6.16	He makes him prosper with the metres.
7.6.17	"He says, "With the dear abode."
7.6.18	Cattle are the dear abode of Agni.
7.6.19	He makes him prosper with cattle.
7.6.20	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, "I go with life, with lustre, with offspring, with prosperity of wealth."
7.6.21	He prays for this blessing for himself.
7.6.22	"He makes him prosper, saying, "The kindlers have kindled thee for a hundred winters."
7.6.23	This indeed, Dasarma Aruṇi said to the Udgātṛ, "What should one do to Agni who is present in the fire-place?"
7.6.24	He said this to him.
7.6.25	He said:
7.6.26	"One should worship him with these two. Your brotherly enemy will be a hundred times worse."
7.6.27	Whoever worships with these two, his enemy becomes a hundred times worse.
7.6.28	The enemy, the sinner, goes to the end of life.
7.6.29	One eats food until one is alive.
7.6.30	O Agni, you are the life-giver.
7.6.31	Grant me life."
7.6.32	He seeks this blessing for himself.
7.6.33	O Agni you are the giver of youth.
7.6.34	Grant me youth."
7.6.35	He seeks for himself this blessing.
7.6.36	O Agni! You are the giver of body.
7.6.37	"Protect my body."
7.6.38	He prays for a blessing for himself.
7.6.39	"He says, "O Agni, fill up what is deficient in my body."
7.6.40	He fills up whatever is deficient in his body."
7.6.41	"You are the kindling of Agni."
7.6.42	"Protect me from being cursed, from Soma, from Yama."
7.6.43	They all protect him.
7.6.44	O Agni, by that heat of yours, do thou heat him who hates us and whom we hate.
7.6.45	He heats him back, he grieves him back, he burns him back, he worships him back, he drives him back.
7.6.46	This was said by Aruṇi:
7.6.47	By this I have overcome all my enemies and all my rivals.
7.6.48	He becomes better and better than he who hates him, and worse and worse than he who hates us, he who knows this and worships Agni.
7.6.49	O Agni, lord of light!
7.6.50	Salutations to your light!
7.6.51	Bestow light on me!
7.6.52	Having pacified all lights, he bestows light on himself.
7.6.53	O Dweller in the Bright Abode, may you attain the other shore safely.
7.6.54	"May the one who is beyond the Vasus grant you welfare."
7.6.55	Night is Citravasu, and day is Arvavasu.
7.6.56	This is indeed the union of day and night.
7.6.57	One who knows this does not suffer from night or day.
7.6.58	The Agni and the sun are indeed the two breaks in the sacrifice.
7.6.59	These are the same as the ones in the section on breaking. The Lord knows the past and the future. He who knows this, he knows.
7.7.1	"The waters are firm."
7.7.2	Because these are waters.
7.7.3	"The greatness is firm."
7.7.4	Because this is greatness.
7.7.5	"The energy is firm."
7.7.6	These are energy.
7.7.7	"The prosperity is firm."
7.7.8	This is prosperity.
7.7.9-17	"May you enjoy yourselves in Revati." Revati is cattle. Cattle are what is between the fires. We are enjoying them in our own cattle-pen. In this womb." This is indeed their womb. In this cattle-pen." This is their cattle-pen. "This is your kinsman. Do not go away from here."
7.7.18	The cattle approach him as if they were near.
7.7.19	They do not stray away, he who knowing thus approaches Agni.
7.7.20	He indeed approaches this world from this world, he who approaches Agni.
7.7.21	"He says, "You are water."
7.7.22	Cattle are water, cattle are the atmosphere.
7.7.23	He indeed stands firm in cattle.
7.7.24	Cattle are afraid of the gods,
7.7.25	This is the only one of the gods who approaches Agni.
7.7.26	They are the lords of him, the trembling one.
7.7.27	"You are the one who is united, of universal form."
7.7.28	These are the names of the cow.
7.7.29	The cow is united, of the universal form.
7.7.30	He takes them.
7.7.31	For non-trembling.
7.7.32	"You who are united, of universal for."
7.7.33	For by form after form she is united.
7.7.34	"May we enter the prosperity of the clan, with cattle, with nourishment of wealth."
7.7.35	For it is by these that she enters and enters into the clan.
7.7.36	"May your wealth be established in me; may I nourish you with a thousandfold nourishment."
7.7.37	He thus bestows a thousandfold prosperity.
7.7.38	They strike the calf away.
7.7.39	Cattle are with their calves.
7.7.40	For the protection of the animals.
7.7.41	Animals become more numerous for him.
7.7.42	Seven bricks are laid in the fire-altar, belonging to the relatives.
7.7.43	They are the seven village-belonging ones for that world.
7.7.44	They are to be laid here: a cow, a horse, a sheep, a goat, an ass, a mule, and a man.
7.7.45	When they strike a cow,
7.7.46	He puts them down in the same place.
7.7.47	He makes it of cow-dung.
7.8.1	"He sees all creatures, saying, "I see all creatures."
7.8.2	He obtains all creatures.
7.8.3	"The creatures of Ida and Manu," he says."
7.8.4	For the creatures of Ida and of Manu are the creatures of Ida.
7.8.5	All domestic and wild animals meet together at night.
7.8.6-11	Therefore, those few animals that are seen at night appear to be many. They are the lords of this world. The Yajus that is recited here establishes them in this world. Agni is born first in this world. He who has kindled the fire destroys his animals that are born.
7.8.12	"O Agni, come to us from heaven to heaven."
7.8.13	He pacifies him who is being born.
7.8.14	"We come to you, O Agni, with our minds, bearing homage, with the two Doshas."
7.8.15	"We come with homage."
7.8.16	"The shining one, the guardian of sacrifices, the shining one of truth,
7.8.17	Growing in his own abode."
7.8.18	"Growing."
7.8.19	"Be to us, O Agni, like a father to his son, a good protector,
7.8.20	"May you protect us with your blessings."
7.8.21	(With) the Svästimatī (hymn).
7.8.22	"O Agni, you are our last resort."
7.8.23	This indeed was said by Divodasa, the son of Bhimasena, to Aruṇi.
7.8.24	"To which Agni, the householder, should the Udgātṛ offer the Garhapatya?"
7.8.25	He said this to him.
7.8.26	He said:
7.8.27	With these (verses) you should worship Agni. You are our last refuge, our protector, the most auspicious, the most friendly.
7.8.28	This is Agni's dear body, which is friendly.
7.8.29	He has approached him with his own dear body.
7.8.30	With two-footed verses.
7.8.31	Man has two feet.
7.8.32	The Garhapatya is the house.
7.8.33	He indeed stands firm in the house.
7.8.34	The three former ones and these four.
7.8.35	These are the seven.
7.8.36	There are seven domestic animals.
7.8.37	He wins them.
7.8.38	"I see you with energy."
7.8.39	"May you see me with energy."
7.8.40	He places energy in his house, in his animals, and in himself.
7.8.41	And he also arranges those bricks which he places.
7.8.42	"They are the Ida, the honey-makers."
7.8.43	These are the Ida-s, the honey-makers.
7.8.44	"May the Svonas enter me, the Madhu."
7.8.45	For the Svonas indeed enter together with the Madhu.
7.8.46	"May your wealth be established in me, may I nourish you for a thousandfold."
7.8.47	He thus bestows a thousandfold prosperity.
7.8.48	They strike the calf away.
7.8.49	Cattle are with their calves.
7.9.6	Having approached Prajapati, having obtained everything, having encompassed everything,
7.9.7	"Make Soma the sound, O Brahmanaspati."
7.9.8	Brahmanaspati.
7.9.9	He places Brahmanaspati in himself.
7.9.10	These are the Vaiśvadevī verses.
7.9.11	These are Vaiśvadevīs, the offspring.
7.9.12	The offspring are born from the womb of Brahman.
7.9.13	This is the Brahman-spati.
7.9.14	He generates them from the womb of Brahman.
7.9.15	Aditi looked after her sons with these (verses).
7.9.16	When they brought Soma, they returned safely from this world with Soma.
7.9.17	He obtains whatever desire he may desire.
7.9.18	One should recite this for him who desires:
7.9.19	"May he return safely."
7.9.20	He should recite this over him.
7.9.21	He returns safely.
7.9.22	"When you are never a stranger, your chariot is a Dūdbha."
7.9.23	This is the union with the Stoma.
7.9.24	"When are you never a stranger?"
7.9.25	This was said by Āruṇi.
7.9.26	"I did not know that the night was a stranger until I heard this verse."
7.9.27	He who knows thus, does not sleep at night.
7.9.28	Agni is the Gāyatrī.
7.9.29	He makes him deficient in the Gāyatry metre.
7.9.30	If one worships with metres other than the Gāyatrīs.
7.9.31	If this Gāyatrī is the last.
7.9.32	He makes up for him with his own metre.
7.9.33	He who worships Agni, having attained everything and having covered everything, goes to the heavenly world.
7.9.34	His progeny is cut off.
7.9.35	When he calls his son,
7.9.36	he continues his progeny.
7.9.37	It is as if he returns to the human world.
7.9.38	When he cries out to his son,
7.9.39	"May the divine thread not be cut off, may the human thread not be cut."
7.9.40	He continues both the world of the gods and the world of humans.
7.9.41	He conquers both worlds.
7.9.42	"You are the one who is low."
7.9.43	He seizes him who is his enemy behind.
7.9.44	"He says, "Thou art the conqueror."
7.9.45	He conquers him who is his equal.
7.9.46	"Thou art the lord."
7.9.47	"I may surpass him."
7.9.48	He crosses over him who is his former enemy who has crossed over.
7.9.49	Pūṣan protect me on the path.
7.9.50	May Pūṣan, the lord of cattle, protect me.
7.9.51	May Pūṣan the lord of lords protect me.
7.9.52	This is Pūṣan on the path.
7.9.53	The sky is the lord of cattle.
7.9.54	Heaven is the lord.
7.9.55	These very worlds protect him.
7.9.56	He kindles Agni.
7.9.57	For continuity.
7.9.58	The eastern direction is Agni, the deity.
7.9.59	Those very deities, indeed, are the ones who, having performed the rites, are victorious. He who attacks him from these directions, is defeated.
7.9.60	"He says, "May the threads be auspicious." He prays for a blessing."
7.9.61	He prays for a blessing.
7.9.62	If he has a son whom he loves, he should take his name.
7.9.63	He places those blessings in him.
7.10.1	The day is the abode, not the night.
7.10.2	She who could not bear the death of her brother.
7.10.3	When they asked her, "When did your brother die?"
7.10.4	She replied, "Today."
7.10.5	The gods said,
7.10.6	"We will conceal it."
7.10.7	"Let us make this night."
7.10.8	They made night.
7.10.9	When night came, they could not see the cattle.
7.10.10	He said,
7.10.11-19	"She does not see." She did not go away. She was not separated from the cattle. The gods, desiring them, went away. They saw them with the metres. Therefore Agni should be attended to at night with the metres. For the protection of cattle. Cattle do not go away from him who knows this. He should know.
7.10.20	He (Agni) is called 'Anu' (i.e. following).
7.10.21	She was destroyed.
7.10.22	The gods said:
7.10.23	"Our wealth has been destroyed."
7.10.24	The Samavāsya (rite).
7.10.25	One's wealth is indeed destroyed.
7.10.26	One who, knowing this, worships Agni, obtains wealth. Another does not obtain his wealth.
7.10.27	The gods destroyed the demons of the day.
7.10.28	They entered the night.
7.10.29-38	The gods could not overcome it. They said to Indra, "You are the strongest of us. You conquer it." "Sing praises to me," he said. "I cannot perform heroic deeds without being praised." They said, "This is your Agni, the nearest. He will sing praises to you."
7.10.39-45	Agni praised him. He, being praised, overcame all the enemies, all the demons, and all the Rakshas. Indra, the Sacrificer, when he approaches Agni, he overcomes all the enemies, demons, and Rakshas. He who knows this Tvaṣṭṛ, having become Prajāpati, created the beings.
7.10.46	Tvashtri is the sacrificer.
7.10.47	Whatever he spoke with speech, that became (true).
7.10.48	Whatever one speaks with speech, that becomes (true).
7.10.49	Whatsoever one speaks with speech that becomes (true), that he creates.
7.11.1	"Protect my wealth, please tell me."
7.11.2	"Protect it for me."
7.11.3	One who is about to depart should stand near the Ahavaniya fire.
7.11.4	This is indeed the protector of wealth.
7.11.5	He gives it back to him.
7.11.6	My name is first, O Jātavedas.
7.11.7	He thus transfers his body to Agni.
7.11.8	Just as the Agnihotra is offered at the end of the day, so also it is offered by one who is absent.
7.11.9	Protect my progeny, O man.
7.11.10	Protect it for me.
7.11.11	He is the protector of progeny.
7.11.12	He gives it back to him.
7.11.13	May Mitra and Varuna protect these houses of mine, O young ones.
7.11.14	For Mitra and Varuna are the protectors of these creatures, the kind and the cruel.
7.11.15	Mitra is the friend, Varuna is the cruel one, this is Pusan.
7.11.16	He gives the houses to these very deities.
7.11.17	Protect my food, O Pusan.
7.11.18	May it be protected for me.
7.11.19	This is indeed the protector of food.
7.11.20	He gives it back to him.
7.11.21	"Tell me where my wealth is hidden."
7.11.22	"Give it back to me."
7.11.23	He again takes the wealth that was hidden.
7.11.24	"O Agni, with a thousand eyes, with a hundred heads, with a hundred rays."
7.11.25	They are deprived of these things, the two Brahmanas, of their breath, of their out-breath, of their lustre, of their strength.
7.11.26	When he worships with these (verses),
7.11.27	They are indeed prospered by them.
7.11.28	"And your name is Jātavedas."
7.11.29	He makes his body as it should be by means of Agni.
7.11.30	"Do not harm my offspring."
7.11.31	"Give it back to me."
7.11.32	He puts back the protected offspring into himself.
7.11.33	"O Agni, lord of the house."
7.11.34	Agni and the sacrificer do not suffer any harm.
7.11.35	He is not deprived of his share.
7.11.36	"My food has been stolen, my excrement has been stolen."
7.11.37	"Give it back to me."
7.11.38	He again puts the food that was stolen back into himself.
7.15.1	Aditi cooked rice for the sake of offspring.
7.15.2	She ate the leftovers.
7.15.3	She conceived.
7.15.4	The Adityas were born from her.
7.15.5	This is the rice that is being cooked. This is the beginning.
7.15.6	The act of stepping on is itself.
7.15.7	The kindling-sticks are of the size of a span.
7.15.8	For this is the size of the Self, equal to Prajapati.
7.15.9	The kind of Agni's body that is fit for sacrifice is in the ashvattha tree, with that he unites.
7.15.10	This is his body of ghee, namely ghee.
7.15.11	When he anoints the kindling-sticks with ghee,
7.15.12	he unites him with those two bodies.
7.15.13	He places it on the path of the fire.
7.15.14	The fire is generated by the Apanguṛti rite.
7.15.15	When he places it on the fire's path,
7.15.16	it is by the Apangurti rite.
7.15.17	The year is generation.
7.15.18	Fire is the generator.
7.15.19	That is generation.
7.15.20	When one places the kindling wood in the fire before the year,
7.15.21	the generator generates him from generation.
7.15.22	Man is not a complete season.
7.15.23	He does not know the season and the constellation in which he is born.
7.15.24	When he lays down the kindling woods.
7.15.25	He obtains the season and the star that belong to him.
7.15.26	When this rice is cooked,
7.15.27	It is indeed a womb that is made.
7.15.28	When the kindling woods are laid down,
7.15.29	That semen is deposited.
7.15.30	In the year, semen deposited becomes born.
7.15.31	When a year has passed, one should install the fire.
7.15.32	One installs it in the progeny.
7.15.33	In twelve nights, the offerings are made before.
7.15.34	They are the image of the year.
7.15.35	Then in three, then in two, then on the previous day.
7.15.36	One should install the fire on the previous day itself.
7.15.37	The Adityas came to this world from above.
7.15.38	They are the guardians of the path.
7.15.39	They ward off the one who is approaching.
7.15.40	The Adityas are the share of the leftovers.
7.15.41	When one anoints the kindling woods with leftovers,
7.15.42	he speaks to them.
7.15.43	Having spoken to them, he ascends to heaven.
8.1.1	The directions were not determined, they were not known.
8.1.2	Then they illuminated the eastern direction for Agni, the Krittikas.
8.1.3	When he lays down Agni in the Krittikas,
8.1.4	he lays him down in the eastern direction.
8.1.5	He alone is the one who is facing east, who has laid down the fire,
8.1.6	the others are facing west.
8.1.7	This is the Agni-related constellation, the Krittikās.
8.1.8	When he lays down Agni among the Krittikā,
8.1.9	he lays it down in its own constellation.
8.1.10	The Krittikas are the head of Prajapati.
8.1.11	When one installs the fire in the Krittikas,
8.1.12	one becomes the chief with a head.
8.1.13	There are seven Krittikas.
8.1.14	There are also seven vital airs in the head. The vital airs are the senses.
8.1.15	One obtains the vital airs and the senses.
8.1.16	The Krittikas is the most nourishing and the most abundant of the constellations.
8.1.17-24	He goes to the prosperity of offspring and cattle. It should be placed on Rohini. The gods placed it on Rohini. With it they ascended the height. That is why Rohini is called Rohini. Prajapati placed it on Rohinī. With it he ascended the height. That is why Rohini is called Rohini.
8.1.25	This indeed is the heaven of man, that he becomes the most powerful in this world.
8.1.26	One should be deposited on Rohini with prosperity.
8.1.27	There were demons named Kalakanjas.
8.1.28	They built bricks.
8.1.29	Indra added a brick to them.
8.1.30	The pairs of them ascended heaven.
8.1.31	Then he removed it.
8.1.32	They were scattered.
8.1.33	Those are the two divine dogs.
8.1.34	He who was separated, he now binds himself with his own intestines.
8.1.35	He places the strength and vigour of them.
8.1.36	He places strength and vigour of his enemy, when he places the fire in the Citra constellation.
8.1.37	This is the Indra constellation, which is dominant.
8.1.38-46	One who desires to be prosperous should deposit (the seed) in the asterism of the preceding Phalguni. One who desires to be wealthy should deposit (the seeds) in the asterisms of the preceding Phālguni. This is the asterism of Bhaga. One becomes wealthy. One who wishes that his progeny should be generous should deposit (the grains) in the asterisk of the following Phalguni. This is the asterism belonging to Aryaman. He who gives is Aryaman. The progeny lives by giving.
8.1.47	Those who are desirous of giving (gifts) become his.
8.1.48	One should place it on a king.
8.1.49	For he lives by giving.
8.1.50	In spring, one should place it on the Brahman.
8.1.51	Spring is the season for the Brahman.
8.1.52	He places it in its own season.
8.1.53	He acquires brilliance and brahminical lustre.
8.1.54	In summer, one should place (the pot) on the king.
8.1.55	Summer is the season for a king.
8.1.56	He places him in his own season.
8.1.57	He places strength and vigour.
8.1.58	In autumn, the Vaishya should place (the fire).
8.1.59	Autumn is the season of the Vaishya.
8.1.60	He places him in his proper season.
8.1.61	He puts down strength and cattle.
8.1.62	He places the fire saying, "I shall sacrifice with Soma."
8.1.63	One should place the fire in whatever season one is going to sacrifice with Soma.
8.1.64	For this indeed made him grow.
8.1.65	One performs the Soma sacrifice.
8.1.66	The full moon of Phalguni is to be set up.
8.1.67	This indeed is the face of the seasons.
8.1.68	He sets it up as the face of the season.
8.1.69	The winter is to be set.
8.1.70	Winter indeed is the birth of Agni.
8.1.71	He sets him up as born.
8.1.72	One sets up Agni saying, "May he prosper in all directions."
8.1.73	In all directions, Agni is in the cold.
8.1.74	He who installs Agni in the cold season prospers in all directions.
8.1.75	One should install it on the full moon or new moon day.
8.1.76	This is indeed the auspicious day.
8.1.77	One installs it on an auspicious day.
8.1.78	Therefore one should perform a sacrifice on the full moon day or new moon day with a horse-sacrifice, a Soma-sacrifice, or a Pāśupuroḍāśa-sacrifice.
8.1.79	This is indeed the sacrifice.
8.1.80	He thus takes up the sacrifice in the sacrifice.
8.2.1	When these two (worlds) were separated, what was sacrificial in the other (world) flowed to this (world), and became Oṣa.
8.2.2	When they become Oṣas,
8.2.3	he places him in the sacrificial (world) of these two.
8.2.4	Oṣas are Prajapati's.
8.2.5	They become more and more.
8.2.6	These are for the purpose of reproduction.
8.2.7	The Uṣas are indeed the dear abode of cattle.
8.2.8	In that there are Uṣas.
8.2.9	He attains the dear abode of the cattle.
8.2.10	This earth was trembling.
8.2.11	It was afraid.
8.2.12	"Fire will burn me."
8.2.13	Fire was afraid.
8.2.14	The wind will destroy me.
8.2.15	This was indeed wet.
8.2.16	The gods made it firm with sand.
8.2.17	They placed brilliance in the fire.
8.2.18	That is why there is sand.
8.2.19	It makes this firm.
8.2.20	It places brilliance in the fire
8.2.21	This was indeed touched by Vritra.
8.2.22	Those who know where her sacrificial life is,
8.2.23	If it is a mound of earth.
8.2.24	He places him on this very life, on the sacrificial (earth).
8.2.25	Water was here.
8.2.26	That Prajapati, having become a boar, dived into it.
8.2.27	As much as his mouth was, so much earth he brought up.
8.2.28	This became (earth).
8.2.29	If it is earth dug up by a boar,
8.2.30	He places him in this very (earth) in a visible manner.
8.2.31	The boar sees food in this (earth).
8.2.32	Therefore this (earth) is called 'Vijihita'.
8.2.33	If it is struck by a boar,
8.2.34	he obtains that very food.
8.2.35	What he took up, that is Aditi.
8.2.36	What spread out, that is Prithvi.
8.2.37	What became, that is Bhumi.
8.2.38	If it is hit by a boar,
8.2.39	May it spread with offspring and cattle.
8.2.40	The food of animals is different, the food of a cow is different, the different food of a horse, the different food for a goat, the different food is for a man, water is the food.
8.2.41	What he sprinkles with water.
8.2.42	He obtains as much food as there is.
8.2.43	These are the five requisites.
8.2.44	There are five manly powers in a man.
8.2.45	He performs with this (verse). He performs with this. He performs with this one.
8.2.46	He obtains as much as is the energy, he attains it.
8.2.47	These are the five requisites.
8.2.48	The sacrifice is fivefold.
8.2.49	He indeed wins the sacrifice.
8.2.50	Neither truth nor energy nor food diminishes.
8.2.51	Energy is the Udumbara.
8.2.52	When they are Udumbara,
8.2.53	He places the oblations on the fire.
8.2.54	They are made of the wood of the śamī tree.
8.2.55	For the sake of union.
8.2.56	Prajapati created Agni and kindled him at the tip of the śamīm tree.
8.2.57	That is why they are made of the śamim wood.
8.2.58	He himself kindles him with his own kindling.
8.2.59	Agni, having become a horse, fled from the gods.
8.2.60	Where he stood, that became the ashvattha tree.
8.2.61	That is the nature of the Ashvattha.
8.2.62	What is produced from the Ashvattha trees.
8.2.63	Whatever is deposited there, that he collects with them.
8.2.64	Agni indeed fled from men to the gods.
8.2.65	The gods thought of him,
8.2.66	"This one will indeed be this."
8.2.67	The Maruts cut off his heart with thunder.
8.2.68	It becomes a divine thunderbolt.
8.2.69	What happens to a tree struck by lightning?
8.2.70	Whatever is deposited there, he collects with that.
8.2.71	There are five kinds of leaves.
8.2.72	For the sake of being in a group of five.
8.3.1	In eight stages, the Brahman should be deposited.
8.3.2	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
8.3.3	The Brahman is in the Gayatri metre.
8.3.4	He places him in his own metre, in the Prātyenya.
8.3.5	Just as a father nurtures his son, so does his own metre nurture him.
8.3.6	In eleven steps, the king should be placed.
8.3.7	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
8.3.8	The Tristup metre is royal.
8.3.9	He places him in his (own) metre, in the Pratyenya.
8.3.10	Just as a father nurtures his son, so does his own metre nurture him.
8.3.11	The Vaishya should be initiated in the twelve procedures.
8.3.12	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
8.3.13	The Vaisheshika is the metre of the universe.
8.3.14	He places him in his own metre, in his own self.
8.3.15	Just as a father nurtues his son, so his own metre nurtures him.
8.3.16	"The boundless, the unfettered."
8.3.17	He places Agni.
8.3.18	The placing is unlimited.
8.3.19	For the securing of the unlimited.
8.3.20	One should place it as much as one thinks with the eye.
8.3.21	The eye is truth.
8.3.22	He places it in truth.
8.3.23	It should be placed in the forenoon.
8.3.24	This is the auspicious time.
8.3.25	He places him in the auspicious time. 
8.3.26	It should be put down before the sun rises and when it is bright.
8.3.27	In this world Prajapati created the creatures.
8.3.28	They were born.
8.3.29	It is to be placed for the purpose of reproduction.
8.3.30	The night is connected with Agni, the day with Indra.
8.3.31	If one were to place it after sunrise, one would go from the colour of Agni.
8.3.32	If before sunrise, from that of Indra.
8.3.33	The one to be placed is the later one when the sun has not risen, the earlier one when it has risen.
8.3.34	He obtains both the colours of Indra and Agni.
8.3.35	The Asura-like night is of one colour, the Shukriya day is of another.
8.3.36	He who places it when the sun has risen, places it in the Shukriya.
8.3.37	The night is according to the unrisen, the day is according to the risen.
8.3.38	He who puts it when the sun rises, puts it in the day.
8.3.39	Men do not know the stars well.
8.3.40	As if they were deliberating, they recite the Puṇyāha (hymn) when the sun has risen.
8.3.41	He who recites the Puṇyāhas when the sun has arisen,
8.3.42	"Seven are thy Agni, O Agni, seven thy tongues, seven thy sages, seven thy dear abodes,
8.3.43	Knowing well the seven Hotrás, thou fillest the seven wombs with ghee."
8.3.44	As many as are the forms of Agni,
8.3.45	Or he who, having placed it, makes him thirsty, he indeed becomes thirsty.
8.3.46	These are the seven-fold forms of Agni.
8.3.47	He indeed pleases them.
8.3.48	He does not become thirsty.
8.3.49	With a full ladle, he offers to Prajapati with his mind.
8.3.50	Prajapati is full.
8.3.51	He indeed attains Prajapati.
8.4.1	"I place you in the vow of the Angirasas, the gods."
8.4.2	The Brahman should be placed.
8.4.3	Those who are the Angiras of the gods, they are the Pratienas of the Brahman. Agni, Vayu, Speech, and Brihaspati.
8.4.4	From that he is related to the sacrifice, from that he goes.
8.4.5	From that indeed he is related to this sacrifice, from that indeed he goes.
8.4.6	Then he accepts it.
8.4.7	"He places it with the words, 'I place you in the vow of Indra, the lord of Maruts.'
8.4.8	It is to be placed by a Kṣatriya.
8.4.9	Those who are the kings of the gods, they are the enemies of the Kṣatriya, Indra, Varuna, Dhātar, Tvashtar.
8.4.10	From that his sacrifice is related, from that he goes.
8.4.11	From that indeed his sacrifice is related and from that he goes,
8.4.12	from that he accepts him.
8.4.13	"I place you in the vow of the mind, in the vow of Gramanī."
8.4.14	It is to be placed with a Vaiśya.
8.4.15	The Maruts are the castes of the gods, they are the kinsmen of the Vaishya.
8.4.16	His sacrifice is from that (Maruts), his (sacrifice) is from that (place).
8.4.17	From that (Maruts) indeed his sacrifice is, from that (place) his (sacrifice) comes.
8.4.18	From that (place) he accepts him.
8.4.19	Ida was the mind.
8.4.20	She went to the Asuras who were kindling the fire.
8.4.21	They first kindled the Ahavanīya.
8.4.22	Then the Garhapatya.
8.4.23	Then the cooking of rice.
8.4.24	He said to them:
8.4.25	Having obtained prosperity, they ascended.
8.4.26	They will be meritorious.
8.4.27	The other one will be.
8.4.28	She went to the gods who were setting up the fire.
8.4.29	They set up the rice-cooking fire first.
8.4.30	Then the Garhapatya.
8.4.31	Then the Ahavaniya.
8.4.32	He said:
8.4.33	They obtained prosperity.
8.4.34	He cut off this world.
8.4.35	They will have merit.
8.4.36	Their offspring will not exist."
8.4.37	Manu himself established it.
8.4.38	She said,
8.4.39	"I will establish the fire for you so that humans may be born among the gods."
8.4.40	She established the Garhapatya first.
8.4.41	Then the Udanapacana.
8.4.42	Then the Ahavaniya.
8.4.43	For the purpose of grasping these two worlds.
8.4.44	Then men were born from the gods.
8.4.45	For the purpose of procreation, this is to be placed.
8.4.46	For the sake of grasping these two very worlds.
8.4.47	Indeed, when Prajapati first spoke, he spoke the truth.
8.4.48	He indeed spoke this three times:
8.4.49	"Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Svaḥ."
8.4.50	This indeed is the truth of speech.
8.4.51	Whatever is true of speech, that he places (in the sacrifice).
8.4.52	The truth is the Bhuva.
8.4.53	He who, knowing this, places it, becomes (true).
8.4.54	This is the other Bhuva, that is the former Bhuva.
8.4.55	Bhuva, Bhuva.
8.4.56	The other one is to be placed.
8.4.57	For the non-following of truth.
8.4.58	Bhuvah, Bhuvah, Svarah.
8.4.59	The former.
8.4.60	All that is obtained before.
8.4.61	Speech indeed, uttered the deity.
8.4.62	Speech is indeed the deity that has been uttered.
8.4.63	Now, whatever is not true, what one swears by speech, what one says in a hurry,
8.4.64	That indeed is the deity which speech uttered. These indeed are those utterances.
8.4.65	This indeed is the divine of speech.
8.4.66	Whatever is the divine of the speech, that he places.
8.4.67-74	This is the lower earth, that is the higher earth. "Bhuvaḥ, Bhuvaḥ." The lower one is to be placed. He places both together. This is his womb. From this he is generated. This is the fire which is within, that is the fire which was before, that is the sun.
8.4.75	This is the one that is released from that.
8.4.76	The second light is indeed that.
8.4.77	"Bhuḥ, Bhuvaḥ, Svaḥ."
8.4.78	The first one is to be placed.
8.4.79	He places both of them together.
8.4.80	This is indeed his womb.
8.4.81	For this is released from that.
8.4.82-88	He who is carried from here to yonder world, that third light is attained by him. This very sun is carried to the west. From that all beings are carried to the west, The gods eat food with Agni. Food is eaten to the west. When one is carried to the western direction, It is for the sake of eating food.
8.4.89	Prajapati created the gods in the east, the Asuras in the west.
8.4.90	He drove the Asuras away with Brahma.
8.4.91	Agni is Brahma.
8.4.92	When one places it facing the west,
8.4.93	it is for the sake of driving away one's enemies.
8.4.94	They approach this half with Agni, they approach this half.
8.5.3	What was previously carried forward, that is the previous carrying forward, the previous carrying forward.
8.5.4	Agni is indeed Prajapati, his horse is the eye.
8.5.5	When they lead the horse in front,
8.5.6	he goes back, seeing his own eye.
8.5.7	The gods, led by the Stoma, drove away the Asuras from these worlds.
8.5.8	The horse was generated from the Stoma.
8.5.9	The horse which they lead in front.
8.5.10	He drives away his foe from these worlds by means of the Stoma.
8.5.11	The Raksases attacked Agni when he was born.
8.5.12	They caught him.
8.5.13	He drove them away with the horse.
8.5.14	The horse which they lead before.
8.5.15	For the driving away of the Raksases.
8.5.16	The sacrifice, having become a horse, passed beyond men.
8.5.17	They think that he who passes beyond is this (sacrifice).
8.5.18	When they turn back the horse,
8.5.19	they turn back the sacrifice and the sacrificer.
8.5.20	Agni entered the horse.
8.5.21	Having become black, he came here, where he is like a deer-skin.
8.5.22	Therefore it is to be stepped over.
8.5.23	When he steps on the horse,
8.5.24	he obtains it.
8.5.25	This is the place,
8.5.26	and also what is hidden.
8.5.27	Therefore one should not step on it.
8.5.28	Indra gave the ascetics to the Salavarika sages.
8.5.29	While they were going, the sage Syumarasmi entered the horse.
8.5.30	Therefore the horse smells its own dung.
8.5.31	"Did you not neglect the sage and the fire?"
8.5.32	They were unable to divide Agni Vibhaj.
8.5.33	They divided him with a horse.
8.5.34	When they lead the horse in front,
8.5.35	it is for the sake of dividing Agni.
8.5.36	The sage and Agni, those two deities, divide him.
8.5.37	A horse should be given.
8.5.38	The horse is Prajapati's.
8.5.39	The horse that is given.
8.5.40	All the deities are pleased with it.
8.5.41	The horse is the supreme gift.
8.5.42	The horse that is given
8.5.43	for sufficiency.
8.5.44	A horse should be given.
8.5.45	Animals enjoy the horse.
8.5.46	The horse belongs to Agni.
8.5.47	Agni, when installed, enjoys it.
8.5.48	Gold should be given.
8.5.49	For the sake of having lustre.
8.5.50	One hundred measures.
8.5.51	He who lays down the fire generates a hero.
8.5.52	The giver of a hundred is a hero.
8.5.53	Thirty measures should be given for the two earlier oblations, and forty for the last.
8.5.54	For the purpose of advancing.
8.5.55	For by advancing one conquers the sacrifice.
8.5.56	The oblation is the self, gold is the filter.
8.5.57	He purifies him in all the oblations.
8.5.58	Agni desired the waters of Varuna.
8.5.59	His lustre fell down.
8.5.60	That became gold.
8.5.61	When one offers gold,
8.5.62	he prospers him with his own lustre.
8.5.63	One should not offer again.
8.5.64	He puts it back after having swallowed it.
8.5.65	One becomes greedy.
8.5.66	The Agni-waters desired Varuna.
8.5.67	They became the waters of Varuna.
8.5.68	What semen Agni shed, that became gold.
8.5.69	What of the waters, that became silver.
8.5.70	Therefore, gold is made of both gold and silver.
8.5.71	What impurity of the embryo, that became bad colour.
8.5.72	Therefore, a Brahmin should not wear bad colour.
8.5.73	That is indeed a blemish.
8.5.74	He cooks the gold.
8.5.75	He nourishes it with its own seed.
8.6.1	Indeed, this Agni has these two forms: this one is the Odanapacana, the one in the middle is the Garhapatya, and the one in the sky is the Ahavaniya.
8.6.2	He who places these two unmanifested forms of his does not turn away from sin. His Rudra becomes a killer of cattle.
8.6.3	Whatever they attend to,
8.6.4	he establishes them in their own place, having determined them. He turns away from sin. His Rudra is not harmful to his cattle.
8.6.5	"The sky is great."
8.6.6	One becomes great by installing Agni.
8.6.7	"The earth is the earth."
8.6.8	One becomes greater and greater.
8.6.9	"On her, O goddess Aditi, he places the eater of food for the eater of food, for the eater of the food of the eater of food."
8.6.10	He places the eater of the eater of the fire for the eater of fire.
8.6.11	He places the fire for the one who eats.
8.6.12	He who, knowing this, places the fire, eats food.
8.6.13	Now these are the verses of the Serpent Queen.
8.6.14	This is the Serpent Queen.
8.6.15	Food is the king of serpents.
8.6.16	He places the fire for food.
8.6.17	He eats food, he who, knowing this, places the fire.
8.6.18	Spring nourishes the creatures for summer.
8.6.19	Summer for the rains.
8.6.20	The rains for autumn.
8.6.21	Autumn for winter.
8.6.22	Winter for the cold.
8.6.23	The cold for Agni.
8.6.24	Agni for the sacrificer.
8.6.25	He lays down Agni for the sake of food.
8.6.26	He who, knowing this, lays down Agni, eats food.
8.7.1	The offered oblation becomes placed, near, and unsprinkled.
8.7.2	Then, having sprinkled the middle oblation, he places the dice and offers.
8.7.3	Varuna, of firm vow, sat down in the pastures for sovereignty, with good resolve.
8.7.4	Viraj stepped three times, the Garhapatya, the Ahavaniya, and the Madhyama, the place of the gods.
8.7.5	He follows Viraj, who has stepped,
8.7.6	he stands firm,
8.7.7	he goes to the firm place.
8.7.8	He offers to Dharma-dhrti.
8.7.9	He makes him firm in Dharma.
8.7.10	Savitar, the supporter, is killed by the cow.
8.7.11	They are separated from it.
8.7.12	They offer it to the assembly.
8.7.13	By that he becomes pleased with him.
8.7.14	"He offers with the verse, "Brahmā indeed is the lord of speech."
8.7.15	He offers with a verse addressed to the All-gods.
8.7.16	He takes the verse for him.
8.7.17	Having approached him, they consult.
8.7.18	The gods and men were together in cooking rice.
8.7.19	Those men then surpassed the gods.
8.7.20	The gods, having offered food to them, went forth to the Garhapatya.
8.7.21	They followed them there.
8.7.22	Those men then surpassed the very gods.
8.7.23	The Gods, having offered cattle to them, went out to the Ahavaniya.
8.7.24	They went after them there.
8.7.25	Those men indeed surpassed the gods.
8.7.26	The gods, having performed the sacrifice for them, went out to the assembly.
8.7.27	They followed them there.
8.7.28	Those men indeed surpassed the Gods.
8.7.29	The gods having performed the Viraj for them, went forth to the invocation.
8.7.30	They did not follow them from there.
8.7.31	These are indeed the stages of the gods.
8.7.32	He who knows this goes to a better and better world.
8.7.33	This is the truth of the gods, which is not conquered, namely, the invitation.
8.7.34	Therefore one should go to the invitation in the morning.
8.7.35	One goes to the truth.
8.7.36	Therefore one does not go to the invitation without being invited.
8.7.37	Therefore one speaks no untruth at the invitation.
8.7.38	Agni is the name of the one who cooks rice.
8.7.39	One who knows this, Agni is born in his mouth.
8.7.40	The house is the Garhapatya.
8.7.41	One who know this becomes the owner of a house.
8.7.42	The sacrificial post is the Ahavaniya.
8.7.43	The sacrifice bows to him who knows this.
8.7.44	The middle is the Adhidevana.
8.7.45	One who thus knows prospers with offspring and cattle.
8.7.46	The unfulfilled invitation.
8.7.47	He who desires it, and he who knows this, does not attain it.
8.8.1	A goat should be given.
8.8.2	For the sake of having a common origin.
8.8.3	A garment should be given. 
8.8.4	A garment belonging to all deities.
8.8.5	For the fulfillment of the deities.
8.8.6	Increasing gifts should be given.  
8.8.7	The sacrificer increases in accordance with the increase of the gift.
8.8.8	A gift that is brought near should be given. The gift that is brought
8.8.9	near is like a cow.
8.8.10	For she brings the milk to him.
8.8.11	He who lights the fire does not become inferior.
8.8.12	A cow should be given to the Hotṛ.
8.8.13	For the attainment of blessings.
8.8.14	A bull to the Adhvaryu.
8.8.15	He attains the sacrifice through Agni.
8.8.16	A chariot should be given.
8.8.17	This is indeed the divine chariot that is employed at the sacrifice.
8.8.18-26	He approaches the divine chariot with a human chariot. A pair of cows should be given. For the securing of a pair. Six should be given. Six are the seasons. He stands firm in the seasons. Twelve should be given. Twelve are the months, a year. For the attainment of the year.
8.8.27	If one were to transgress twelve, one should give twenty-four.
8.8.28	The Gayatri has twenty-four syllables.
8.8.29	The Gayatry is the mouth of the sacrifice.
8.8.30	One does not transgress the mouth of the Gayatry.
8.8.31	There are three oblations.
8.8.32	These are the three worlds.
8.8.33	One attains these worlds.
8.8.34	The Viraj (goddess) stepped forth three times.
8.8.35	He makes him step over Viraj, the powerful one.
8.8.36	When he purifies,
8.8.37	he purifies him.
8.8.38	When he burns,
8.8.39	burning is food.
8.8.40	He gives him food by that.
8.8.41	When he is pure,
8.8.42	he makes him pure, fit for sacrifice, by that.
8.8.43	May I have cattle.
8.8.44	May I be endowed with offspring.
8.8.45	"May it be luminous."
8.8.46	He places Agni.
8.8.47	Pavamāna is indeed the breath.
8.8.48	From the breath, animals are born.
8.8.49	When (he offers) to Agni Pavamāna,
8.8.50	he thereby generates animals for him.
8.8.51	The purifying ones are indeed the waters.
8.8.52	From the waters, beings are born.
8.8.53	To Agni Pavaka,
8.8.54	He thus generates progeny for him.
8.8.55	The sun indeed is pure.
8.8.56	He is the bestower of brilliance.
8.8.57	When one says, "to Agni, the pure,"
8.8.58	The sun indeed bestows brilliance on him.
8.8.59	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a battle.
8.8.60	That Agni, having attained victory, distributed his body into three parts: one part in the animals, one part in the water, one part in that yonder sun.
8.8.61	When these oblations are offered,
8.8.62	he thus gathers together his body.
8.8.63	He thus places it with body and with brilliance.
8.8.64	These oblations are these worlds.
8.8.65	There are many kinds of grass.
8.8.66	He wins these worlds.
8.8.67	If there were many kinds of grass,
8.8.68	it would be for the sake of procreation of the world.
8.8.69	One should not cut it.
8.8.70	The offspring are born less.
8.8.71	The northern ones should be of the same kind of grass.
8.8.72	It is for the sake of the procreation of the worlds.
8.8.73	One is born again.
8.8.74	We know this world, we see this world, but we do not see or know the other world.
8.8.75	Therefore the offering of the same grass should be made in the northern direction.
8.8.76	These are the offerings for cattle.
8.8.77	Clarified butter is the cake.
8.8.78	Rudra is Agni.
8.8.79	If one were to offer it in the Amāvasya, one would give cattle to Rudra and would become without cattle.
8.8.80	It should be offered in the Samvatsara.
8.8.81	He pacifies him in a year.
8.8.82	This is a loose (way) of performing the sacrifice, it is without a source, when one offers at the end of a year.
8.8.83	One should offer at the end of the year.
8.8.84	For the sake of not being loose and for having a source.
8.9.1	Agni did not desire this world.
8.9.2	Whatever raw meat they cook in this world, whatever they burn, whatever they cook in theft, he did not desire to come to this world.
8.9.3	When he returned to this world, he emerged with those forms of his which were fit for sacrifice.
8.9.4	These are the Pavamana, Pavaka, and Shuchi.
8.9.5	His body which was Pavamana, with that he entered the animals.
8.9.6	With that which was Pavaka and water.
8.9.7	With that (body) which was pure, the sun.
8.9.8	Pavamana is indeed the breath.
8.9.9	Animals move with breath.
8.9.10	If one offers to Agni Pavamana,
8.9.11	he thereby bestows animals on him.
8.9.12	This is his body by which he entered the animals, when ghee is offered, the glow of fire shines forth.
8.9.13	This is his body by whom he entered the waters, when he sees it in the waters.
8.9.14	Having washed his hands and bathed, he wears it as if with faith.
8.9.15	The same Agni who is in the waters, he purifies and delights him.
8.9.16	What is offered to Agni Pavaka,
8.9.17	he purifies him with the animals.
8.9.18	This is his body by which he entered the waters; when ghee is offered, it shines like red fire.
8.9.19	This is his body, by which he entered the sun, which shines above, which is like light.
8.9.20	What is for Agni, the pure.
8.9.21	For manifestation.
8.9.22	For fame.
8.9.23	For fame and glory.
8.9.24	For radiance.
8.9.25	This is his body, by which he entered the sun. When ghee is offered, it shines like gold.
8.9.26	When these oblations are offered,
8.9.27	he collects his body.
8.9.28	He places it with body and lustre.
8.9.29	These oblations are these worlds.
8.9.30	There are many kinds of grass.
8.9.31	These worlds are established in many ways.
8.10.1	The offerings are made with the Gāyatrī verse.
8.10.2	Agni is Gāyatrī, the Gāyatrīs are the verses.
8.10.3	This is done for Agni, namely the Agnihotra.
8.10.4	Agni indeed is Agni, when he proceeds, then the offerings are made to Agni.
8.10.5	Agni is kindled by Agni.
8.10.6	One should recite the Anuvākyā for the two northern oblations.
8.10.7	For the abode of brilliance.
8.10.8	Urvashi was Pururava's wife.
8.10.9	She went back to the gods.
8.10.10	He was born with life among the gods.
8.10.11	She followed him.
8.10.12	He again requested her.
8.10.13	They did not give her back to him.
8.10.14	Therefore, they gave him life.
8.10.15	This is life."
8.10.16	"He placed Agni in the cauldron and said, 'Place this in the cauldron and you will beget with it.'"
8.10.17	He placed Agni on a branch of a tree and approached the village with life.
8.10.18	He returned again.
8.10.19	There was Agni burning at the top of the tree.
8.10.20	He saw it.
8.10.21	This indeed is that Agni.
8.10.22	Having taken the kindling-sticks, he kindled the fire and placed it.
8.10.23	By that he was born.
8.10.24	When the kindling-stick is used,
8.10.25	it is for procreation.
8.10.26	One desiring cattle should offer a cake on clarified butter to Aditi at the new moon.
8.10.27	This is Aditi.
8.10.28	Cattle are born on her.
8.10.29	The Agni-installation is the mouth of the sacrifice.
8.10.30	Having obtained the mouth of the sacrifiice, one obtains cattle.
8.10.31	It is performed with four oblations.
8.10.32	Because cattle are fourfold.
8.10.33	The pairs are two.
8.10.34	They are created by virility.
8.10.35	One should offer the Agni-Soma oblation on the full moon day.
8.10.36	The Brahman is Agni.
8.10.37	The Soma king is the deity.
8.10.38	The Agni-installation is the mouth of the sacrifice.
8.10.39	Having stepped over the mouth of the sacrifiice, one attains self-sovereignty.
8.10.40	The sacrifice did not bow down to the gods.
8.10.41	They became exhausted.
8.10.42	"The sacrifice does not bow down to us."
8.10.43	Among them, the Agni-Soma alone bowed down to the sacrifice first.
8.10.44	They knew
8.10.45	Agni and Soma indeed first approached our sacrifice.
8.10.46	We desire the approach of the sacrifice to them."
8.10.47	They said:
8.10.48	"You indeed first approached our sacrifices.
8.10.49	May the sacrifice approach to you."
8.10.50	They said this:
8.10.51	"We shall choose the boon.
8.10.52	"We two alone are the foremost recipients of the sacrificial butter."
8.10.53	Therefore Agni and Soma alone are the foremost receivers of the sacrificial butter.
8.10.54	Because they are surrounded by the Varuṇa.
8.10.55	When one offers the Agni-Soma oblation,
8.10.56	it is for the fulfilment of the sacrifice.
8.10.57	For from here the sacrifice first bowed down to the gods.
8.10.58	If he were to offer anything else, he would enclose the sacrifice with a deity.
8.10.59	Indeed, Agni and Soma are a pair.
8.10.60	Soma is the seed-bearer, Agni is the procreator.
8.10.61	Indeed, this entire (universe) is Agni.
8.10.62	The waters, plants, and trees - that is Soma.
8.10.63	Indeed, these two are the most beloved of the gods.
8.10.64	Indeed, we see these two.
8.10.65	Just as men worship in this way, so do the gods worship.
8.10.66	They thought:
8.10.67	"We shall conquer you with this raised (weapon)."
8.10.68	They raised it.
8.10.69	With it they conquered.
8.10.70	It is raised for the sake of conquest.
8.10.71	Agni, being without a support, was afraid.
8.10.72	"One should not place it too far away."
8.10.73	For the sake of not being without a support.
8.11.1	Agni, when created, created the Agnihotra.
8.11.2	Therefore, they follow the Agnihotra with the Agni that has been set up.
8.11.3	The evening offering is dedicated to Agni, the morning one to Surya.
8.11.4	If one were to offer to Agni in the morning, one would avoid procreation in front.
8.11.5	One would do something contrary to the established order.
8.11.6	With the full ladle, he offers to Prajapati with his mind.
8.11.7	Prajapati is full.
8.11.8	He indeed attains Prajapati.
8.11.9	Prajapata is full with prosperity, deficient with adversity.
8.11.10	Man is full with desires, deficient with prosperity.
8.11.11	He indeed obtains prosperity with prosperity.
8.11.12	We are brought to other gods, not brought to others.
8.11.13	We live by the touch of others.
8.11.14	We are brought by the earth, wind, and water, and we live by their touch.
8.11.15	We are not brought by fire, sun, and heaven, and we live near them.
8.11.16	They alone are obtained.
8.11.17	They alone bring him.
8.11.18	One becomes a member of the better group.
8.11.19	Those who know this do not fear the evil of man.
8.11.20	If one were to obtain it by oneself, one would be a deceiver.
8.11.21	One obtains it with ghee and herbs.
8.11.22	One becomes free from deception.
8.11.23	He who has a fire installed is brought to the gods.
8.11.24	They eat his food.
8.11.25	One offers with a full ladle.
8.11.26	With a full ladle, one offers to Agni, saying "Enough!"
8.11.27	It is enough for him.
8.11.28	The plants and the trees of the forest were united with the day.
8.11.29	They destroyed everything else from here.
8.11.30	That Prajapati thought,
8.11.31	"These alone have become this."
8.11.32	Having created Agni, he placed it.
8.11.33	With that he destroyed them.
8.11.34	The fire is indeed laid for one who is able to bear the loss of his brother.
8.11.35	He who is able to lay the fire but does not do so, is indeed the one who has not yet laid the fire.
8.11.36	He eats what has been offered and enjoyed.
8.12.1	The fire is indeed to be laid, it is not to be laid.
8.12.2	They discuss:
8.12.3	"One who is going to lay the fire tomorrow."
8.12.4	It is indeed to be done.
8.12.5	This is indeed a sacrifice without fire.
8.12.6	The goat should stay bound during that night.
8.12.7	The goat has the brilliance of fire.
8.12.8	He places that very fire.
8.12.9	It should be black.
8.12.10	It is indeed all-deity.
8.12.11	One who is going to place the fire tomorrow should observe the vow during that night.
8.12.12	He should not eat meat.
8.12.13	He should not approach a woman.
8.12.14	Every man has fire within him.
8.12.15	Fire may depart from him.
8.12.16	This is his birthplace.
8.12.17	For from this he is generated. He who takes it out,
8.12.18	He who is on the right, is generated for the sake of brahmic glory.
8.12.19	Then indeed he makes him of the same origin as Agni.
8.12.20	But Durga-upas.
8.12.21	They should churn it out every day.
8.12.22	From wherever he may bring it.
8.12.23	This is his unconfined body.
8.12.24	He indeed wins that.
8.12.25	Where he sees it burning, from there he should bring it.
8.12.26	These indeed are the deities that manifest.
8.12.27	He indeed gains them.
8.12.28	One should take food from a person who is cooking.
8.12.29	This is the body of her who is the source of food.
8.12.30	One obtains that very (body).
8.12.31	From the house of one who is wealthy like a demon, whether he be a brahmin or a vaishya, one should take (food).
8.12.32	One obtains that wealth and food which is there.
8.12.33	But one should not eat in his house.
8.12.34	One makes an effort three times.
8.12.35	These are the three worlds.
8.12.36	He attains these worlds.
8.12.37	What he undertakes,
8.12.38	he attains this world by that.
8.12.39	What he runs forward,
8.12.40	he attains the atmosphere by that.
8.12.41	Whatever he puts down,
8.12.42	he attains that yonder world.
8.12.43	Having put down, he should not take up again.
8.12.44	He is a transgressor.
8.12.45	He becomes worse.
8.12.46	Prajapati created the creatures from the vital airs.
8.12.47	They were born.
8.12.48	One should take it from that measure.
8.12.49	For reproduction.
8.12.50	One should not take it too much.
8.12.51	Agni would burn his vital airs and he would die.
8.12.52	One should nor take it too little.
8.12.53	That is a transgression.
8.12.54	One becomes worse.
8.15.1	The re-installation is Agni's share.
8.15.2	He who seeks that share, causes it to be lost.
8.15.3	If he thinks, having deposited it,
8.15.4	"It is lost."
8.15.5	He should deposit it again.
8.15.6	He who seeks the share that is lost, causes it to become lost. Having obtained it, he causes it to be halved.
8.15.7	Everything is done for Agni.
8.15.8	Whatever share he gives to Agni, he obtains all prosperity.
8.15.9	They say that the materials are not to be collected.
8.15.10	The Yajus is not to be performed."
8.15.11	For the materials have been collected and the Yajus performed.
8.15.12	That should not be guarded.
8.15.13	The materials should be collected and the Yajas performed.
8.15.14	The garment should be given again.
8.15.15	The bull should be released again.
8.15.16	The chariot should be released again.
8.15.17	These are the forms of the re-establishment.
8.15.18	He makes it prosper with forms alone.
8.15.19	Agni, sinking, sinks after the plants.
8.15.20	These are the plants, the darbha grass.
8.15.21	When the darbha grass is used as a covering.
8.15.22	He binds him to the plants from the waters.
8.15.23	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
8.15.24	Those gods, desiring victory, entrusted their dear bodies to Agni.
8.15.25	"If we win, let us turn back; if they win, let them attack us."
8.15.26	They desired victory.
8.15.27	"Let all of us be together."
8.15.28	Agni said,
8.15.29	He who would place it for me, may he be born with these forms.
8.15.30	The gods placed it.
8.15.31	They were born with these forms,
8.15.32	He who, knowing this, places it, is born with these forms alone.
8.15.33	Tvashtra placed it for the sake of cattle.
8.15.34	These are the cattle of Tvashtra.
8.15.35	They prospered.
8.15.36	Manu, desiring prosperity, took up (the sacrifice).
8.15.37	He prospered these nourishments.
8.15.38	By that he prospered.
8.15.39	Prajapati, desiring offspring, took up (a sacrifice).
8.15.40	These offspring of Prajapati were born.
8.15.41	By that they prospered.
8.15.42	He who took it up became prosperous by that wealth.
8.15.43	Therefore, Punarvasu.
8.15.44	Therefore, the sacrifice to be taken up is Punarvasu.
8.15.45	He who places it on that (day) succeeds.
8.15.46	Therefore, Anurādhā.
8.15.47	Therefore, it should be placed on Anurādhās.
9.1.1	Agni, when sinking, sinks for a year.
9.1.2	Seventeen kindling verses should be done.
9.1.3	The year is seventeen, five seasons, twelve months.
9.1.4	This indeed is the year.
9.1.5	He thus wins him (Agni) in a year.
9.1.6	They say,
9.1.7	"It should be done with fifteen (verses), not with seventeen."
9.1.8	For this is the most suitable for the year, that it is fifteen.
9.1.9	Fifteen Sāmidhenī verses are recited.
9.1.10	Fifteen are the nights of half a month.
9.1.11	By them they are attained.
9.1.12	As many syllables as there are in the Sāmidhenī verses, so many days are there in the year.
9.1.13	They are obtained by them.
9.1.14	Agni, when he is sinking, sinks for a year.
9.1.15	There are six seasons in a year.
9.1.16	The six divisions.
9.1.17	He binds him to the year.
9.1.18	The year is Agni Vaiśvānara.
9.1.19	The six seasons.
9.1.20	Therefore there are six divisions.
9.1.21	When the two-syllabled and four-syllabled verses are made,
9.1.22	because these animals are fourfold.
9.1.23	The pairs are the two.
9.1.24	They are the creators of power.
9.1.25	Whatever Agni does in many ways, whatever he nourishes these beings,
9.1.26	Therefore Agni alone attains all these cases, not other deities.
9.1.27	The Prajās are the mouth of the sacrifice.
9.1.28	If one were to interrupt the Prajās, one would interrupt the mouth of the sacrifi
9.1.29	The Prajaas are food.
9.1.30	If one interrupts the Prajā, one interrupts food.
9.1.31	If he desires:
9.1.32	"May he prosper."
9.1.33-41	He should offer the portions of the Prayājas on top of that. The Prayājas are indeed virility. The portions are virility. He makes the offering with virility. One goes to the place of prosperity. One goes to the place where there is no Agni. They say: Why are the Prayājas offered with portions? They are offered for a year.
9.1.42	The Prayājas are those.
9.1.43	By that (oblation) one makes the Agniya (oblation).
9.1.44	By that the Agniya is made different.
9.1.45	"Return with energy, O Agni, with life and food;
9.1.46	Return, O Agni, protect us from evil."
9.1.47	One should offer before the Prayājas.
9.1.48	"Return, O Agni with wealth;
9.1.49	Satisfy, O Agni, all around with the stream of all-nourishing (food)."
9.1.50	He should offer the Uparyajus after the Uparyajuses.
9.1.51	He falls down with his cattle from the energy.
9.1.52	He regains the energy and cattle.
9.1.53	And he obtains the blessings of the sacrifice from both sides.
9.2.1	It is done differently for Agni.
9.2.2	They say:
9.2.3	Why do they offer the Ajyabhāgas?
9.2.4	The two portions of clarified butter are indeed the eyes of the sacrifice.
9.2.5	If one were to offer the two portions of clarified butters in between, one would obstruct the eyes of the sacrificer.
9.2.6	"One should offer the two portions with the verse, "O Agni, do thou purify the life-breaths."
9.2.7	One should offer the portion of clarified butter of Soma in this world.
9.2.8	Because it is dedicated to Agni.
9.2.9	Therefore it is dedicated to Agn.
9.2.10	Because it belongs to Pavamana.
9.2.11	Therefore it belongs to Soma.
9.2.12	The two portions of clarified buiter are not offered separately.
9.2.13	One does not obstruct Soma.
9.2.14	Agni is the head of heaven, the crest.
9.2.15	One should perform this rite for Soma's ghee portion in the world of one who desires offspring or one who desires cattle.
9.2.16	Because it is a pair.
9.2.17	Therefore it is generative.
9.2.18	Because it has semen.
9.2.19	Therefore it belongs to Soma.
9.2.20	One does not perform Agni rites separately.
9.2.21	One does no harm to Soma.
9.2.22	Indeed, he who extinguishes the fire is the destroyer of heroes among the gods.
9.2.23	Shatadayu is the hero.
9.2.24	These are the hundred syllables, the rows of syllables.
9.2.25	He thus makes the gods speak to the hero.
9.2.26	One should be placed for another Prama, and another should be placed again.
9.2.27	One does not attain her by placing her for whom one places her again.
9.2.28	One attains her by placing her again.
9.2.29	Old age is the life of the gods.
9.2.30	For as many times as he lives.
9.2.31	Therefore they say,
9.2.32	"He who gives a hundred is a hero."
9.2.33	Because these are the hundred syllables, the rows of syllables,
9.2.34	He obtains as much energy as there is.
9.2.35	He attains it.
9.2.36	He who destroys the fire is deprived of life and energy.
9.2.37	Man has a hundred years of life and a hundred years of energy.
9.2.38	Life, strength, gold.
9.2.39	If one gives a hundred gold coins,
9.2.40	one regains life and strength.
9.3.1	One who puts out the fire is deprived of the sacrifice.
9.3.2	The sacrifice is fivefold.
9.3.3	If it is five-headed,
9.3.4	one regatins the sacrifice.
9.3.5	They say:
9.3.6	One should do it with eight heads, not with five heads.
9.3.7-14	The Gayatri has eight syllables. Agni is Gayatri, the Gayatri is the metre. This is done for Agni, namely the re-installation. Therefore it is with eight potsherds. One should not be afraid of that. One should do it with five potsherds. The Agni who is sinking sinks for a year. There are five seasons in a year.
9.3.15-22	Or from the fifth, the sixth season was born. This is the same as the fifth and sixth seasons. Because he has five cups. He has won him from the year itself. There are five seasons. The seasons are procreation. Because he (the sacrificer) has five cups. For procreation.
9.3.23-30	The seasons are the begetters, Agni is the begetter. That he is five-headed. From begetting he begets him by the begetter. The Adityas went to this world with all. Having gone to this world, they were afraid. They knew: "He came here from the gift of that." They again placed him.
9.3.31-37	By that he prospers. The Adityas are prosperous in this world. The Aditvas are prosperous in the other world. Cattle are in this world. The seasons are in the other world He who knowing thus, places this (Agni) prospers in both worlds. Ketas, Suketas, Saketas, may the Adityas, enjoying this oblation, be satisfied. Svāhā.
9.3.38	May Salila, Saliga, and Sagara, the Adityas, enjoy this oblation. Svāhā!
9.3.39	The light of heaven, the shining Adityas, may the gods, in the gods, grant us the true invocation of the gods.
9.3.40	To the Adityas svāhā.
9.3.41	With these they established him.
9.3.42	By that he succeeded.
9.3.43	When he establishes with these, then he is established.
9.3.44	The sun is the offering-material.
9.11.1	Prajapati desired,
9.11.2	"Let me beget offspring."
9.11.3	He divided himself into ten parts.
9.11.4	His mind was the ladle, his mind the clarified butter, his speech the altar, his learning the sacrificial grass, his banner the fire, his knowledge the fire-priest, his speech the Hotri-priest, his mind the Upamantri-priest, the breath the oblation, the Samaveda the Adhvaryu-priest,
9.11.5	Having divided himself into ten, he made a pair and desired the abode.
9.11.6	He desired the abode to be three-fold, the vital airs.
9.11.7	Then he created offspring.
9.11.8	Then one went upwards and one went downwards, each by fifteen.
9.11.9	The one who went upwards was the bright fortnight.
9.11.10	By that he created the gods.
9.11.11	The gods, who were above, followed him as he grew upwards.
9.11.12	He who went downwards and became the lower half of the month,
9.11.13	with that he created the Asuras.
9.11.14	The Asuras followed him as he went downwards and became destroyed.
9.11.15	He created the gods following his right hand.
9.11.16	They became powerful.
9.11.17	The Asuras followed the left hand.
9.11.18	They became weak.
9.11.19	Therefore the right half of the body is more vigorous.
9.11.20	He created the gods with truth; they became truth.
9.11.21	He created Asuras with untruth; they became untruth.
9.11.22	He created gods with day; they attained the bright colour.
9.11.23	The Asuras were the nights, the gods were the days.
9.11.24	He desired that very thing.
9.11.25	In which he would sacrifice.
9.11.26	He saw Indra himself as his own self.
9.11.27	All other things were born.
9.11.28	He said to Indra,
9.11.29	"Go, svāhā!"
9.11.30	He drove it away.
9.11.31	Breath is power, Indra is power.
9.11.32	He placed power in power.
9.11.33	And those who were the masters of the Soma-house at the four-fold sacrifice, they sat down.
9.11.34	"They generated Indra."
9.11.35	Among them, the earth was the Hotri, the heaven the Adhvaryu, Tvashtri the Agnin, Mitra the Upasthita.
9.11.36	They took up these two Grahas.
9.11.37	They desired a place of abode.
9.11.38	They found a place of abode in the Ekavimsa (stoma).
9.11.39	They generated Indra.
9.11.40	They, the five-sacrificers, the lords of Varuna's house, sat down.
9.11.41	"We have attained heaven."
9.11.42	Among them Agni was the Hotar, the Asvins were the Adhvaryus, because they were the Asvins, therefore the five-sacrificer, Rudra was the Agnid, Brihaspati was the Upasad.
9.11.43	They took up these two Grahas.
9.11.44	They desired a dwelling place.
9.11.45	They found a dwelling place of thirty-nine.
9.11.46	They went to heaven.
9.11.47	Having made that bridge, they created those animals.
9.11.48	They took them to the gods, a horse to Yama, gold to Agni, a cow to Rudra, a garment to Brihaspati, a man to Prajapati.
9.12.1	Of that horse of Yama, he who took it, lost half of his power.
9.12.2	He accepted it with this (verse).
9.12.3	He placed half of the power in it.
9.12.4	He who, knowing this, accepts a horse, places half of the power.
9.12.5	He who accepts it without knowing this, half of his power departs.
9.12.6	Of that Agni, the gold was accepted, and a third of the power departed.
9.12.7-11	He accepted it with this (verse). He placed the third part of the sense-organ. He who, knowing this, accepts gold, places the third part of his sense-organ. He who, not knowing this, accepts it, loses the third part of it. When Rudra accepted the cow, the fourth part of his sense organ was lost.
9.12.12-16	He accepted it with this (verse). He placed the fifth part of the sense-organ. He who, knowing this, accepts a cow, places the fifth part of his sense-organ. He who, not knowing this, accepts (a cow), loses the fifth part of it. The fifth part of the senses of Brihaspati, who accepted the garment, was lost.
9.12.17	He accepted it with this (verse).
9.12.18	He attached the fifth (verse) to the sense-organ.
9.12.19	He who, knowing this, accepts a garment, attaches the fifth (verse), to the sense-organs.
9.12.20	He who accepts it without knowing this, loses the fifth sense-organ.
9.12.21	The sixth sense-organ of Angiras, who was lying down, departed.
9.12.22	He regained it by this (verse).
9.12.23	He added the sixth sense-organ.
9.12.24	He who, knowing this, regains what has been lost, adds the sixth sense-organism.
9.12.25	He who, not knowing this, accepts a man, loses the sixth sense-faculty of him.
9.12.26	When Prajapati accepted the man, the seventh sense-faculty of his departed.
9.12.27	He accepted him with this.
9.12.28	He bestowed the seventh sense- faculty on him.
9.12.29	He who, knowing this, accepts the man, bestows the seventh sense-faculties on him.
9.12.30	He who, not knowing this, accepts it, loses control over the seventh sense-organ.
9.12.31	Who gave this? To whom?
9.12.32	Desire to Desire.
9.12.33	For Desire is the giver.
9.12.34	Desire is the receiver.
9.12.35	Desire entered the ocean.
9.12.36	For Desire, like the ocean, is unlimited.
9.12.37	I accept you with Desire.
9.12.38	This belongs to Desire.
9.12.39-42	He accepts it out of desire. He establishes it out of desire.
9.12.43	He who knows them and from whom they came, becomes worthy of receiving gifts.
9.12.44	He who knows the gift and by whom they received it, becomes more prosperous than the receiver.
9.12.45	For they became more prosperous than the receivers.
9.12.46	Those gods having gone to heaven, became desirous.
9.12.47	They knew:
9.12.48	"It has come here from that (heavenly) gift."
9.12.49	They said to the sages:
9.12.50	"Give us this."
9.12.51	"By what means do you know the seven Hotras?"
9.12.52	"You will know it here itself."
9.12.53	The seven Hotras, the noble householders, sat down.
9.12.54	"Let there be continuity."
9.12.55-59	Their Hotṛ was Mahāhaviṣ, their Adhvaryu Satyaharviṣ, their Agnīdhra Acittapāja, their Upabarhi Acittamāna, their Prastotṛs were Anadhrṣya and Apratīdhrṣya, their Udgātṛ was Ayasya. They took this Graha. They desired a place of abode. They thought that the number thirty-three was the place of abode. They made it their own.
9.12.60	And indeed, the thirty-three gods and the seven-sacrificing gods are connected with each other in that the gods and men give to each other.
9.12.61	To him who knows this, the giving is continuous and uninterrupted.
9.13.1	Prajapati is the ten-sacrificing god.
9.13.2	The new and full moon sacrifices are the four-sacrificing god
9.13.3	The seasonal sacrifices are the five-sacrificing god,
9.13.4	The Soma sacrifice is the seven-sacrificer god,
9.13.5	Agnihotra is the ten-hotr.
9.13.6	Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa is the four-hotr. 
9.13.7	Animal sacrifice is the six-hotr.  
9.13.8	Soma sacrifice is the seven-hotr.   
9.13.9	Breath is the ten-hotṛ.
9.13.10	Eye is the four-hotṛ.  
9.13.11	Ear is the five-hotṛ.   
9.13.12	Speech and Self are the seven-hotṛ.    
9.13.13	For longevity, Agnihotra is offered. One who knows this attains the entire span of life.
9.13.14	To whom is the full moon worshipped for the eye? To whom is the new moon worshipped for the ear? To whom is Soma worshipped for speech and self? To whom is Agni worshipped for the mind? To whom is Indra worshipped for the body? To whom is Varuna worshipped for the breath? To whom is Yama worshipped for the life? To whom is Rudra worshipped for the semen? To whom is Brahma worshipped for the mind and self? To which one is the full moon worshiped for the eye? The one who knows this is not the owner of the eye.
9.13.15	To whom is the new-moon worshiped for the ear? The one who know this is not the master of the ear.
9.13.16	To whom are Soma and Agni worshiped for speech and self, respectively? The one who understands this is not the lord of speech or self.
9.13.17	Prajapati is the ten-priest.
9.13.18	One who knows this becomes the most prominent among those who speak, and one who knows this becomes many.
9.13.19	To whom is Agni worshipped at the full moon?
9.13.20	A brahmin is related to Agni.
9.13.21	Agni is related to the Gayatri metre.
9.13.22	One who knows this is in his own deity, in his own abode.
9.13.23	No one else has control over his prosperity and welfare. One who knows this
9.13.24	To whom is Soma worshipped at the new moon?
9.13.25	He who knows this attains the whole of his life.
9.13.26	For heaven, the gentle sacrifice is performed.
9.13.27	By that one goes to heaven.
9.14.1	One who does not prosper with offspring and cattle should wear a garment of bark, drink hot water, and lie down for twelve nights.
9.14.2	In the morning of the twelfth day, having run east, one should announce the Dashahotara.
9.14.3	For this is not a union.
9.14.4	Prajapati is the ten-hotr.
9.14.5	Having divided himself into ten parts and made a union, one is born with offspring and cattle.
9.14.6	One should sacrifice to one desiring sons with four hotrs.
9.14.7	The gods generated Indra with four hotrs
9.14.8	The son is power.
9.14.9	He generates a son for him.
9.14.10	But no one else is born after him.
9.14.11	He is born with all the senses and all the energy.
9.14.12	The gift is a boon.
9.14.13	For a boon is a son.
9.14.14	One should sacrifice to the king in battle with the four-fold Hotr.
9.14.15	The gods generated Indra with the four-hotr.
9.14.16	Those among whom Indra is present, they win the battle.
9.14.17	He generates Indra for him.
9.14.18	May he be victorious in battle.
9.14.19	Whatever he wins there, that is the Dakshina.
9.14.20	For prosperity.
9.14.21	One should perform the five-fold Homa for one desiring cattle.
9.14.22	The gods created cattle through the five-fold Homas.
9.14.23	He generates all cattle for him.
9.14.24	His four Dakshina are a horse, gold, a cow, and a garment.
9.14.25	One who performs the seven-fold sacrifice, becomes more sinful than the one who performs the sacrifice according to the prescribed rules.
9.14.26	One who performs the sacrifice in a manner contrary to the prescribed rules, becomes more sinful.
9.14.27	One who does so, goes away from here.
9.14.28	The gods went to heaven by performing the seven-fold sacrifices.
9.14.29	One who builds this (world) by performing the sevenfold sacrifices,
9.14.30	builds it together.
9.14.31	One does not become more sinful than the way one performs the sacrifice.
9.14.32	He who knows the four Hotr priests to be worthy of being gratified with libations, is gratified with progeny and cattle. The Soma-drink bows down to him.
9.14.33	Having explained the Dashahotar, one should sing with the Bahispavamana.
9.14.34	Prajapati is the Dashahotri.
9.14.35	He indeed generates progeny.
9.14.36	Having explained Catuhotri, one should sing the Ajya.
9.14.37-43	The gods generated Indra with four Hotr priests. He generates Indra for him. He makes that pressing (of Soma) with Indra. One should sing the Madhyandina Pavamāna after explaining the five Hotr priests. The gods drove away the Asuras with five Hotr priests; They generated cattle with five Hotr (priests). He drives away his enemy and generates cattle.
9.14.44	Having explained the Saptāhotṛ, one should chant with the Pavamāna of Arbhava.
9.14.45	The gods went to heaven with the Saptāhotra.
9.14.46	He who has the Saptāhotrā, he creates this (world).
9.14.47	He indeed creates together.
9.14.48	One should explain the Daśāhotṛ when the Sāmidhenī verses are being recited.
9.14.49	Prajapati is the Daśāhotra.
9.14.50	One indeed generates offspring.
9.14.51	One should describe the Catuhotr in front of the Prāyaṇīya offerings.
9.14.52-58	The gods generated Indra with four Hotr priests. He generates Indra for him. He makes the sacrifice with Indra. One should recite the verse "The five Hotr priests" when the oblations are being offered. The gods drove away the Asuras with five Hotr priests. They generated cattle with five Hotr. He drives away his enemy and generates cattle.
9.14.59	He should recite the Saptāhotṛ (mantra) after the Anuyājas.
9.14.60	The gods went to heaven through the Saptāhotra.
9.14.61	He who is born through the Saptāhōtra,
9.14.62	he indeed expands.
9.14.63	One should touch the oblations at the Full Moon sacrifice through the Catuhotra.
9.14.64	The gods generated Indra through the Catu-hotra.
9.14.65	The Full Moon is indeed generation.
9.14.66	He indeed generates.
9.15.5	Why are they called the four Hotṛs?
9.15.6	There are four sacrifices.
9.15.7	And they have four Hotṛs.
9.15.8	That is why they are called the four Hotrs.
9.15.9	One should not eat for a year.
9.15.10	That is their vow.
9.15.11	This is the sacrifice of one who has not established the sacred fire, namely the four Hotṛ.
9.15.12-18	They know this to be for food. For energy and strength. On the tenth day, the Udgātṛ should chant the Rg verses of the Serpent Queen. This is indeed the Serpent Queen. The four Hotṛs are food. Having obtained food, one attains food. The four Hotṛs, indeed, are not employed and not attained.
9.15.19	And when the Hotṛ recites the four Hotr-priests,
9.15.20	he employs them.
9.15.21	He wins them.
9.15.22	This is the praise of the gods, the unuttered, which is the verses of the Serpent-king.
9.15.23	Its praise is the unuttered, the four Hotr priests.
9.15.24	He praises with the mind, he sings with the mind, and he responds with the mind.
9.15.25	The Udgātṛs indeed sprinkle the semen.
9.15.26	When the Hotṛ recites the four Hotr-verses,
9.15.27	the Hotṛ indeed generates the sprinkled semen.
9.15.28	One should recite at the Agni-installation.
9.15.29	The Agni-installation indeed is the means of crossing over of Brahman.
9.15.30	The four Hotr-recitations indeed are the means of crossing of Brahman.
9.15.31	This is the rising of Brahman, when the sun rises.
9.15.32	Brahman creates everything.
9.15.33	Now these are the requisites.
9.15.34	Indeed, the sacrifices of the gods and the demons were performed together.
9.15.35	Whatever the gods did, the demons did the same.
9.15.36	The gods took the sacrifice and departed.
9.15.37	They brought it up above.
9.15.38	He defeated the Asuras.
9.15.39	What they collected together, that is the reason for the name of the Sambhara.
9.15.40	One who is going to perform the four rites with the Soma collected together should offer with the four verses.
9.15.41	He takes the sacrifice and the deity first.
9.15.42	The one who has the sacrifice is the one who has the deity.
9.15.43	One should recite at the initiation.
9.15.44	This much is the sacrifice.
9.15.45-50	Having taken the entire extent of the sacrifice, one consecrates. One should recite for twelve days. The sacrifice is of this extent, as much as twelve days. Having taken the entire extent, one consecrates for twelve days. Now these are the wives. The Asuras conquered the sacrifice of the gods from the south.
9.15.51	Their Agnidhra was not conquered.
9.15.52	The gods united with their wives.
9.15.53	The Asuras, the Hliakas, having abandoned their wives, returned again.
9.15.54	The gods, having risen from that, conquered them with the midday Pavamana.
9.15.55	He who knows his wives, becomes Agnidhra.
9.15.56-61	He mounts the enemy's house and cattle. The enemy does not mount his house and cattle. He who knows this, offers the Patnīvat Agni. He satisfies his wife. The satisfied wife conceives. From the semen are born offspring.
9.15.62	He who is born with offspring and cattle.
9.16.1	Having created offspring, he desired:
9.16.2	"May I create a sacrifice."
9.16.3	He saw this seven-hotar.
9.16.4	He followed it mentally and offered.
9.16.5	With that he created the sacrifice.
9.16.6	That sacrifice created from him went away.
9.16.7	He seized it with the Graha.
9.16.8	That is the Graha's Grahahood.
9.16.9	One who is about to be initiated should offer seven Hotrás before (the Soma).
9.16.10	Having created the sacrifice, he makes it grow.
9.16.11	It becomes a Graha.
9.16.12	For the stability of the created sacrifice.
9.16.13	Having created the Yajna, he desired:
9.16.14	"May I create the Darsha-Paurnamasa."
9.16.15	He saw this four-hotr.
9.16.16	He offered it with the mind following it.
9.16.17	With that he created the New and Full Moon sacrifices.
9.16.18	They went away from him, the New and Full-Moon sacrifices, when they were created.
9.16.19	He seized them with the cup following them.
9.16.20	That is the reason for the cup being called a cup.
9.16.21	One who is about to perform the New and Full moon sacrifices should offer before them with the four-hotr.
9.16.22	Having created the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices, he performs the Alābha.
9.16.23	It becomes a Graha.
9.16.24	For the creation of the Darśa-Pūrṇamāsas, for their stability.
9.16.25	Having created the Darśas and Pūrṇamasas, he desired:
9.16.26	"Let me create the Cāturmāsya sacrifices."
9.16.27	He saw this five-hotr (sacrifice).
9.16.28	He offered it by following it with his mind.
9.16.29	With that, he created the Cāturmāsyas.
9.16.30	Those four-monthly sacrifices were created by him, and they went away to the distant regions.
9.16.31	He seized them with the Graha (cup), reciting the Anudruta (verse).
9.16.32	That is why the Graha is called Graha.
9.16.33	One who is about to perform the four-monthly sacrifices should offer the five Hotr offerings before (the main sacrifice).
9.16.34	Having created the four-monthly (sacrifices) and having seized them, he makes them thin.
9.16.35	It becomes a Graha.
9.16.36	For the creation of the four months, for stability.
9.16.37	One who is practising sorcery should offer in the tenfold Homa.
9.16.38	There are nine vital airs in a man, the navel is the tenth.
9.16.39	He thus places the vital airs in him.
9.16.40	One should offer in a self-made pit or ravine.
9.16.41	This is indeed his (pit) seized by Nirriti.
9.16.42	He thus seizes him with Nirriti.
9.16.43	One makes the Vasat-offering.
9.16.44-50	This is the cruelest of speech. He strikes him with the cruelest of his speech. The Angirasas and the Adityas competed for the heavenly world. The Adityas saw this five-hotr. They offered it after following it with their minds. Then the Adityas went to the heavenly world. The Angirasas fell down.
9.16.51	They said to the Angirasas, the Adityas:
9.16.52	"Where are you? How shall we offer our oblations to you?"
9.16.53	"In the metres," they said.
9.16.54	They said:
9.16.55	"In the Gayatri metre are the Vasus, in the Tristubh metre the Rudras, and in the Jagati metre the Adityas."
9.16.56	"Here indeed, oblations are offered to the gods who are in the heaven."
9.16.57	"He who knows thus, and knows the gods through instruction, becomes one who knows through instruction.
9.16.58	One who desires heaven should offer this five-hotr sacrifice, having mentally recited it.
9.16.59	There are five seasons.
9.16.60	The seasons are the year.
9.16.61	The year is the heavenly world.
9.16.62	Having established himself in the seasons and the year, he attains the heavenly world.
9.16.63	He who, not being a Brāhmaṇa, would not like to recite the Veda, should go to the forest, having tied a bundle of Darbha grass, and sitting to the right of a Brāhmaṇā, should explain it.
9.16.64	This is the Brahman of the gods, which is the four Hotr priests.
9.16.65	It makes him known when he is being explained.
9.16.66	Having tied up a bundle of darbha grass, he explains (the meaning of the verses).
9.16.67	The bundle of darbha is Agni.
9.16.68	He explains it as being Agni.
9.16.69	The Brahman sits on the right side.
9.16.70	The Brahman is the observer of the people.
9.16.71	He explains (the meaning) as being the observer.
9.16.72	The one who explains and the one who sits on the right, both of them are the lords of fame and prosperity.
9.17.5	Indra and Agni are strength and vigour.
9.17.6	He goes to them with strength and vigour. They go to him with strength and vigour,
9.17.7	for they do not go to him unwillingly.
9.17.8	Indra and Agni are strength, vigour.
9.17.9	What is Indra-Agni?
9.17.10	He goes to him with strength, vigour, taking their strength and vigour. He goes to him unwillingly.
9.17.11	One desiring offspring should offer a cake on eleven potshards to Indra and Agni.
9.17.12	When Prajapati was about to create offspring, Indra and Agni hid them.
9.17.13	He knew,
9.17.14	"Indra and Agni have hidden my offspring."
9.17.15	He saw this cake on eleven potsherds to Indra and Agni,
9.17.16	Then they returned the offspring to him.
9.17.17-22	Indra and Agni, having hidden the offspring of him who is fit for offspring, do not give him offspring. He approaches them with the same oblation. They, being pleased with him, again give him offspring. The Yajya and Anuvakya are related to the giver of the gift. For prosperity. One should offer an Indra-Agni oblation on eleven potsherds while going to battle.

Indra and Agni themselves strengthen him with strength and energy. One should offer a cake on eleven potsherds to Indra and Agni and a cooked meal to Pusan for one who is going to fight.
9.17.35-41	Indra and Agni are strength and vigour. He goes forth with strength and vigour. The giver of vigour is Pusan. What is dedicated to Pusan. Pusan himself bestows vigour on him. One should offer a cake on eleven potsherds to Indra and Agni, a rice-pap to Pusan, and a rice-pap for the lord of the field, if one desires: "May I prosper in this community."
9.17.42	Indra and Agni are strength and vigour.
9.17.43	The Indra-Agni (offering) is for strength and vigour. The Indra-Agni offering is for strength and vigor.
9.17.44	Indra and Agni indeed bestow on him strength and vigour. He indeed attains the world of Indra and Agni.
9.17.45	Pusan is the bestower of vigour.
9.17.46	The Pusan (offering) is the bestower. The Pusan (offering), indeed, is the bestower (of vigour).
9.17.47	Pusan indeed bestows vigour on him.
9.17.48	This is the wife of the field.
9.17.49	The Field-Lord (offering) is (for the wife of the) field. The Field-Lord (offerings) is (for) the wife of the (field).
9.17.50	He indeed stands firm in this (wife of the field).

10.4.13	It connects him with Brahmic glory.
10.4.14	Just as the spokes are attached to the nave, so the months and seasons are attached to the year.
10.4.15	When he puts gold in the middle,
10.4.16	he makes him like the navel.

10.5.36	For the concealment of Rakshas.
10.5.37	This is Vamadeva's fifteenfold hymn, the hymn to the cow.
10.5.38	Vamadeva and Kusidayi went to a race for themselves.
10.5.39	Kusidayi cut off the front axle of Vamadeva' s chariot which was going too fast.
10.5.40	It turned back to the second one.

10.10.104	As many as the deities are, he unites himself with all of them through his own strength.
10.10.105	It becomes so.
10.10.106	This is the Isti called Vijiti.
10.10.107	He conquers his enemies by means of the best (conquest). He who knowing thus offers with this (oblation) conquers his enemies.
10.11.1	Prajapati created the animals.
10.11.2	They fled from him.
10.11.3	Among them Brihaspati followed them with a step.
10.11.4	Where they settled, there he found the cow, the mother of the cattle.
10.11.5	Having seized her, he took her.
10.11.6	Brihaspati said to him:
10.11.7	"I will sacrifice you with this."
10.11.8	"Your cattle will certainly return."
10.11.9	He offered a cake on eleven potsherds to Prajapati in water.
10.11.10	Then his cattle returned.
10.11.11	One who desires cattle should offer a cake on eleven potsheds to Prajapati (in water).
10.11.12	Those who have gone away from him are the animals, he who has no animals.
10.11.13	Prajapati is the bestower of animals.
10.11.14	He approaches him with his own share.
10.11.15	He again turns the animals towards him.
10.11.16	There may be cow's urine.
10.11.17	For the sake of having the same origin.
10.11.18	Having created animals, Prajapati made Pusan their overlord.
10.11.19	They fled from him.
10.11.20	Pusha followed them with a verse.
10.11.21	Where they settled, he found the cow Shaka.
10.11.22	Having seized her, he took her.
10.11.23	With her he said to Prajapati,
10.11.24	"Establish yourself with this.
10.11.25	These cattle will certainly return to you."
10.11.26	Soma was afflicted by that.
10.11.27	This is mine, what is grown without cultivation."
10.11.28	He offered a cake to Soma and Pūṣan in water, with the Garutmā mantra.
10.11.29	Then the cattle returned to him.
10.11.30	One who desires offspring or cattle should offer a cake to Soma-Pūṣan in the water, with the Gārtumā mantra.
10.11.31	Soma indeed is the bestower of semen.
10.11.32	Pūṣan is the progenitor.
10.11.33	Soma indeed bestows semen on him.
10.11.34	Pūṣan generates.
10.11.35	One obtains offspring or cattle, whichever one desires, for whom one offers.
10.11.36	There may be cow's urine.
10.11.37	For the sake of having the same origin.
10.11.38	One should offer a cake to the Maruts and Priyavanga, milked by a she-goat, desiring to be with one's own kind.
10.11.39	The Maruts were born from a she-goat. They are of the same kind as speech.
10.11.40	The Marut are of the same origin as the earth.
10.11.41	This is the milk of the Maruts, which the Priyanguvas (priyangu) have.
10.11.42	He takes them with their own milk.
10.11.43	Just as a calf sucks its mother, so do his kinsmen suck him.
10.11.44	The Anuvakya is connected with what is dear.
10.11.45	The Yajya is connected with prosperity.
10.11.46	What is dear is connected with what.
10.11.47	He makes him dear to his kinsmen.
10.11.48	What is prosperous is connected with what.
10.11.49	He makes him attain prosperity.
10.11.50	The Anuvakya has two feet.
10.11.51	The Yajya has four feet.
10.11.52	He obtains cattle with two and four feet.
10.11.53	One should offer a cake on eleven potshards to Indra, and a cake to Maruts in the Priyangava manner.
10.11.54	They should cook it after (the other oblations) for one from whom a Brāhmaṇa should be separated.
10.11.55	Indra is the king.
10.11.56-63	The Maruts. He places the Vis (people) in accordance with the Kshatra (ruling class). When he is being recited, they recite it facing west. He places Vis (people) behind him. For non-intermixture. One should offer a cake on seven potsherds to Maruts and a cake on eleven potsherds to Indra, if one desires: "May I make the Vis and the Kshatra equal." Indra is the Kshatra.
10.11.64	The Maruts are the Vitas.
10.11.65	He makes them equal to their share.
10.11.66	One should offer to Indra after reciting the Marut hymn.
10.11.67	One should make an offering to the Maruts after reciting the Indra hymn.
10.11.68	He takes the kingdom away from the people.
10.11.69	The Maruts are the Kshatras.
10.11.70	They decide among themselves.
10.11.71	One should pour out the oblation for the cake on both sides, whichever one desires.
10.11.72-80	they would be defeated. He makes the two sides shine forth. They are defeated by the stronger. One should offer this (oblation) when one desires: "They should be united." One should offer the Prasriti. He unites them with the Bhaga offering. One should make an offering of seven potfuls to Maruts when a Kshatriya or a Brahmin is afraid of being defeated by the Visas.
10.11.81	The Maruts are indeed the Vidyadharas.
10.11.82	He appeases them with the offering of a share.
10.11.83	This is the hymn of Agastya, the one beginning with "Kya shubhi."
10.11.84	One should recite it also in the Sāmidhenī verses.
10.11.85	It should be the Yajya and Anuvākyā.
10.11.86	Agastya indeed threw a hundred cows and heifers to the Maruts.
10.11.87	He offered them to Indra.
10.11.88	The angry Maruts hurled a thunderbolt at him.
10.11.89	He saw this hymn.
10.11.90	With it he appeased them.
10.11.91	What is recited here,
10.11.92	for peace.
11.1.1	One should offer a Marut oblation.
11.1.2	The twenty-one-fold covering would be of green colour, and the covering would be of gold. One should make the Kṣatriya cover the fault.
11.1.3	The Vidyas are the Maruts.
11.1.4	One appeases them with the share.
11.1.5	It becomes twenty-one-folded.
11.1.6	There are twenty-one groups of Maruts.
11.1.7	Because it is twenty-one-folds.
11.1.8	He wins them by means of the unobstructed ones.
11.1.9	One desiring progeny should offer a cake on eleven potshards to Indra and a cake on twelve potshards to the All-gods.
11.1.10	Indra is the nobility.
11.1.11	These creatures are of the All-gods
11.1.12	He unites the people with the nobility.
11.1.13	Having taken out the oblation from the Indra cake, one should offer both the oblations from the All-gods cake.
11.1.14	Then from the Indra cake.
11.1.15	Indra is the Kshatra.
11.1.16	These creatures are of the Visve Devas.
11.1.17	He encloses the people on both sides with the Kshatra itself.
11.1.18	The Yajya and Anuvakya are of Indra and the Visve Devatas.
11.1.19	For prosperity.
11.1.20	The Dakshina is gold, which is to be given after being increased.
11.1.21	He places the kinsmen above him.
11.1.22	This is the oblation called Anuvartman.
11.1.23	He makes his own people follow the same path.
11.1.24	One who has drunk Soma should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Soma.
11.1.25	Indra drank Soma without being invited by Tvashtri.
11.1.26	He became afflicted with Soma-drinking.
11.1.27	Therefore, Soma should not be drunk without being invited.
11.1.28	One becomes afflicted with Soma-drink.
11.1.29	When he vomited it, they became the Shyamaka grains.
11.1.30	This indeed is the Soma-drink, namely, the Shyamaka.
11.1.31	He obtains the Soma-drink in the very presence.
11.1.32	One should perform the Saumeendra (rite).
11.1.33	One who vomits Soma is deprived of the Soma-drink by the power of Indra.
11.1.34	The Brahman is the deity of Soma.
11.1.35	The Soma-drink is the power of Indra, since it is Saumeendra.
11.1.36	He thus makes him prosper with the Soma-drink itself.
11.1.37	Soma-drink is not retained by him who vomits Soma.
11.1.38	He should collect the rice-grains.
11.1.39	He should cook them and pour them back.
11.1.40	He thus retains the Soma-drink in him.
11.1.41	One desiring sight should offer to Agni Jyotishmat a cake on eight potsherds and a rice-pap to Surya, and above that a cake on eight potsheds to Agni Jyotismat.
11.1.42	Men see with the eye at night by Agni,
11.1.43	and by day by Surya.
11.1.44	They are the givers of sight.
11.1.45	He approaches them with their own share.
11.1.46	They give him sight.
11.1.47	The deity of the Samani is divided into two; therefore the eye is divided into two.
11.1.48	Therefore the Samani and the Anuvakya are used in the same sacrifice.
11.1.49	He offers in the middle of the Sūrya.
11.1.50	He does this here.
11.1.51	What is between the eyes.
11.1.52	For the separation of the eyes.
11.1.53	He gives three balls.
11.1.54	He has yoked the seven-steed chariot of the seven-steeds, the knower of beings.
11.1.55	He gives him that very eye.
11.1.56	This is the Rajani sacrifice.
11.1.57	By this sacrifice, Kuneya, the son of Kratujit, performed the sacrifice for Janaki who desired to have eyes.
11.1.58	One who desires eyes should perform this sacrifice.
11.1.59	One who desires to prosper should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, a cake on eleven potsherds to Indra, and a cake on eight potsherds to Brhaspati.
11.1.60	Indra, being unsupported, became weak.
11.1.61	He sought refuge in Agni and Brhaspati. They made him attain prosperity.
11.1.62	They made him attain prosperity with this sacrifice.
11.1.63	Because it is dedicated to Agni,
11.1.64	he placed his brilliance in front of him.
11.1.65	What is Indra-related?
11.1.66	He bestows on him the power of Indra in the middle.
11.1.67	What is related to Brhaspati?
11.1.68	He bestoves on him the brilliance of Brahman above.
11.1.69	Then indeed he became.
11.1.70	One who desires to prosper should offer with this.
11.1.71	What is Agni-related?
11.1.72	Agni is brilliance.
11.1.73	He bestows brilliance on him in front with that.
11.1.74	What is Indra-related;
11.1.75-84	Indra is the sense-organ. By that he places the sense-organ in the middle. If it is dedicated to Brhaspati, Brhaspati is indeed Brahman. By that it places the Brahmanic lustre above. It becomes indeed. He places the navel of the other two in the middle of Indra. He places sense-organ in him in the middle. The middle one is dedicated to Indra. The other two are around.
11.1.85	Agni is indeed brilliance.
11.1.86	Indra is indeed power.
11.1.87	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman.
11.1.88	He thus takes power and Brahman-splendour on both sides of himself.
11.1.89	The offering and the response are threefold.
11.1.90	For prosperity.
11.1.91	This is the oblation called Tri-dhatu.
11.1.92	For he endowed himself with three kinds of power through it.
11.2.1-4	One should offer an oblation to Agni on eight potsherds, to Savitr on eight potsher ds, barley gruel to Vayu, and an oblation to Bhumi on one potsherd, for one whose gold has been stolen or taken away, or for one who desires, "May I obtain gold." Agni first obtained gold. Savitr then invited him.
11.2.5	There is no wind that does not reach it.
11.2.6	They find it in this (earth).
11.2.7	They purify it in this (water).
11.2.8	What is Agni's,
11.2.9	It is indeed by means of wealth.
11.2.10	For indeed, he is the knower of wealth.
11.2.11	Savitr is for the sake of conception.
11.2.12	Vayu's is for the sake (of) proclamation.
11.2.13	They find this in this (earth)
11.2.14	They purify it here (in this water).
11.2.15	These indeed are the deities that rule over gold.
11.2.16	He approaches them with the same oblations.
11.2.17	They give him gold.
11.2.18	When he obtains gold, he should offer this oblation.
11.2.19	The deities who give him gold, he makes them his sharers.
11.2.20	For the sake of non-injury to himself.
11.2.21	One should offer an oblation to Agni on eight potsherds and to Indra on eleven potsherds.
11.2.22	Curd, honey, ghee, cooked rice, and rice grains, all mixed together.
11.2.23	One should offer this to obtain cattle.
11.2.24	The Agniya (offering) is for prosperity.
11.2.25	The Indra (offering) is
11.2.26	Indra is the giver of cattle.
11.2.27	One approaches him with his own share.
11.2.28	He gives cattle to him.
11.2.29	What is mixed together?
11.2.30	Cattle are mixed together.
11.2.31	He indeed wins cattle.
11.2.32	One should perform the rite for Indra.
11.2.33	Indra is the bestower of cattle.
11.2.34	If one were to perform two rites for Indra, there would be a quarrel.
11.2.35	One should do the rite for Prajapati.
11.2.36	Prajapati is the source of cattle.
11.2.37	He indeed generates them from their own source.
11.2.38	Prajapata is the bestower.
11.2.39	He indeed approaches him with his own share.
11.2.40	He gives him cattle.
11.2.41	The Revati is the Yajya and Anuvakya of one who has mixed (the two sets of verses).
11.2.42	The Shakvari is of the other.
11.2.43	Cattle are the Revati.
11.2.44	Cattle are Shakvari.
11.2.45	He indeed wins cattle.
11.2.46	These five are mixed.
11.2.47	Two are the other.
11.2.48	They are seven.
11.2.49	The Shakvari has seven feet.
11.2.50	Cattle are Shakaras.
11.2.51	He indeed wins cattle.
11.2.52	It becomes a verse.
11.2.53	A man is a verse.
11.2.54	Having become all, he approaches the cattle.
11.2.55	Ghee becomes (the offering).
11.2.56	Ghee is indeed Agni's.
11.2.57	Agni is the one who causes to flow.
11.2.58	He indeed causes it to flow with that.
11.2.59	Honey becomes (the offering)
11.2.60	Honey is indeed Soma's.
11.2.61	Soma is the one who nourishes semen.
11.2.62	He indeed nourishes semen with that.
11.2.63-71	and rice-grains. The rice-grains are the form of the day. The rice grains are the form of night. Animals are born in accordance with the day and night. They are born either at night or during the day. He thus causes them to be born in accordance with day and night. There is curd. Animals have this form. Curd is
11.2.72	He obtains cattle of the same kind.
11.2.73	One should not offer honey.
11.2.74	Honey is life.
11.2.75	One should offer life to the fire.
11.2.76	One would become short-lived.
11.2.77	One should perform this sacrifice for longevity.
11.2.78	One obtains cattle and attains longevity.
11.2.79	If one does not perform this sacrifice, one should give a boon.
11.2.80	One obtains a boon by means of a boon.
11.2.81	One should give two.
11.2.82	For there are two, Prāṇa and Apāna.
11.2.83	One should give three.
11.2.84	For there is three, Prāṇa, Vyāna and Apāna. 
11.2.85	He places them in the sacrificer.
11.2.86	One should only give one.
11.2.87	But it is Trivṛt.
11.2.88	For Trivṛt is Prāṇa.
11.2.89	It is indeed much.
11.2.90	One offers something different from another.
11.2.91	He is the lord of another form, the nourisher.
11.2.92	He should give a cow with a calf.
11.2.93	For the redemption of forms.
11.2.94	One should give all kinds of animals.
11.2.95	One obtains all kinds of animals indeed.
11.2.96	If one does not hope for offspring, one should give a cow that is pregnant.
11.2.97	She indeed has all kinds of animals within her.
11.2.98	Because she bears a calf, she is a calf.
11.2.99	Because she is a calf, she has animals.
11.2.100	The one who is the most venerable among us is the one who is the oldest.
11.2.101	He himself releases all the animals.
11.2.102	The waters here are pure.
11.2.103	Only Manu remained.
11.2.104	He saw this sacrifice.
11.2.105	He performed it.
11.2.106	He performed with it.
11.2.107	He prospered with it.
11.2.108	With it he attained this earth.
11.2.109	He goes to that very same place which Manu went to, he who knowing thus offers with this (verse).
11.3.1	The gods did not know (each other).
11.3.2	They went forth in four ways: Agni with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras, Indra with the Maruts, Varuna with the Adityas.
11.3.3	Brihaspati said to them:
11.3.4	"Offer sacrifices to you."
11.3.5	"We shall indeed know each other."
11.3.6	"You will be the officiating priest at my house."
11.3.7	Indra said,
11.3.8	"You will be known for your supremacy."
11.3.9	He offered to Agni Vasumat a cake on eight potsherds, to Soma Rudravat a rice-pap, to Indra Marutvat an oblation on eleven potsherds, and to Varuna Adityavat a rice-pap.
11.3.10	He officiated for Indra at his house.
11.3.11	Then they became known.
11.3.12	They knew that Indra was the best.
11.3.13	He made the two verses of the Tristubh metre to be the Yajya and Anuvakya.
11.3.14	The Tristubh metre is indeed Indra's own metre.
11.3.15	The Tristup metre is strength and valour.
11.3.16	He placed his own metre, strength and valour in him.
11.3.17	Therefore Indra is the strongest among the gods.
11.3.18	Those who do not know their own (true) nature, one should sacrifice to them with this (verse).
11.3.19	One for whom one desires (this),
11.3.20	(he should sacrifice) in his house.
11.3.21	They know (their true nature) together.
11.3.22	These very deities, knowing their share, make him know (his true nature).
11.3.23	One should perform the Yagya and Anuvakya verses in the Tristubh metre.
11.3.24	The Tristubh metre is strength and energy.
11.3.25	He places strength and vigour in them.
11.3.26	At the Samvartani (sacrifice) one should offer the Samyag-homa.
11.3.27	For prosperity.
11.3.28	This is the sacrifice called Samjnaani.
11.3.29	They indeed know (the truth).
11.3.30	Prajapati gave his daughters to Soma, the king, as stars.
11.3.31	He dwelt only with Rohini.
11.3.32	They, being followed, went back.
11.3.33	Therefore, a woman who is not given away goes back to her own home.
11.3.34	He followed them.
11.3.35	He again asked for them.
11.3.36	They did not give them back to him.
11.3.37	He said:
11.3.38	"Let us live together everywhere."
11.3.39	Then they said, "We will give them back to you."
11.3.40	He lived only with Rohini.
11.3.41	Then that falsehood seized him.
11.3.42	Soma, the king of the moon,
11.3.43	When the king was seized by the disease, that was the origin of the disease of kings.
11.3.44	He dried up like grass.
11.3.45	He became helpless.
11.3.46	He said:
11.3.47	"You should stay with all of us."
11.3.48	"Then I will release you."
11.3.49	Therefore the moon dwells with all the stars.
11.3.50	He performed the rite of the moon on the night of the new moon with a cake to Visvedevas.
11.3.51	By that he was freed from consumption.
11.3.52	He grew along with it.
11.3.53	One who is afraid of consumption should perform the rite of the new moon night with a cake to the Visvedevas.
11.3.54	He is released from consumption.
11.3.55	He grows along with him who is growing.
11.4.1	One who is the youngest among his brothers should offer a cake to Brhaspati on barley grains.
11.4.2	Brhaspati was the youngest among the gods.
11.4.3	He attained the foremost position.
11.4.4	Brhaspatī is the deity of one who is the youngest.
11.4.5	He offers it to him.
11.4.6	He makes him offer it first.
11.4.7	Brahma is Brihaspati.
11.4.8	Brahma, the father of the Brahmanas,
11.4.9	is the lord of his son, whether he is in front or behind.
11.4.10	Brahma himself makes him offer it.
11.4.11	These are the last grains of rice.
11.4.12	He makes them offer it first.
11.4.13-21	He offers the oblation. He approaches them. They lead him to the front. The sacrificial grass becomes fresh again. The kindling wood becomes fresh again. For prosperity. One desiring progeny should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Brhaspati. His offering and offering-prayer should be in the form of a group. The Brāhmaṇa is the deity of Brhaspati.
11.4.22	He offers to his own deity.
11.4.23	The Yajya and Anuvakya verses are in the form of a group.
11.4.24	He makes him a member of the group.
11.4.25	One should offer cooked rice to Brahmaṇaspati.
11.4.26	The Yājya and Anuvākyā verses should be in the form of Maruts. One who desires
11.4.27	should say, "May there be Brahma's strength."
11.4.28	Brahmaṇaspati is Brahma.
11.4.29	The Maruts are the semen.
11.4.30	He destroys the enemies in the Brahman.
11.4.31	Brahman becomes the strength.
11.4.32	One should offer a cake to Aryaman for one who desires,
11.4.33	"My offspring should be desirous of giving."
11.4.34	Aryaman is the one who gives.
11.4.35	The offspring live on giving.
11.4.36	They become desirous of giving to him.
11.4.37	He should offer cooked rice dedicated to Indra and Brhaspati for a royal person who desires to prosper.
11.4.38	The gods were afraid of the royal person who was being born.
11.4.39	They bound him with a rope and threw him into the water.
11.4.40	The royal person is born as one who is not bound by water.
11.4.41	If he were to be born without being bound by water, nothing would exist.
11.4.42	He would rule over all these creatures.
11.4.43	The kingly one is connected with Indra as the deity.
11.4.44	Brahma is Brihaspati.
11.4.45	He releases him from the waters by means of Brahma.
11.4.46	He flows forth for vigour, not being obstructed by the waters.
11.4.47	The fee is gold doubled.
11.4.48	It is for the sake of removing the bondage of the waters.
11.4.49	One desiring life should offer a cake to Prajapati, with a hundred black beans and ghee.
11.4.50	The gods were afraid of death.
11.4.51	They were without a protector.
11.4.52	He sacrificed to them with this Iṣṭi.
11.4.53	Gold is immortality.
11.4.54	He placed immortality in them with immortality.
11.4.55	Then they became immortal.
11.4.56	One who is afraid of death should sacrifice with this.
11.4.57	Gold is indeed immortality.
11.4.58	He places immortality in it with immortality.
11.4.59	It becomes a hundred black-bees.
11.4.60	Man has a hundred years of life, a hundred powers.
11.4.61	He obtains life and power.
11.4.62	A Vaiśvadeva (offering) should be performed.
11.4.63	For he worshipped all the gods.
11.4.64	A Prājāpatya (offering) should also be performed.
11.4.65	Prajapati is the womb.
11.4.66	One indeed stands firm in the womb.
11.4.67	Four and four kṛṣṇalas make an Avadāna.
11.4.68	For prosperity.
11.4.69	They offer it to Brahman.
11.4.70	Brahman is Brahman.
11.4.71	He places in it the one-year-long life with Brahman.
11.4.72	One who desires should offer with this,
11.4.73	"He should say, "May I be more powerful."
11.4.74	This indeed is the heaven of man, that one becomes more powerful in this world.
11.4.75	He who, knowing this, offers with this (rite), prospers and becomes more prosperous.
11.4.76	One who has lost his prosperity should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Surya.
11.4.77	His covering should be of green gold.
11.4.78	Silver should be below it.
11.4.79	This sun is the end; man, having gone to the end of prosperity, turns back.
11.4.80	He seizes it from the end.
11.4.81	He does not become worse than he was when he performed the sacrifice.
11.4.82	This (sun) was here.
11.4.83	He moved, burning this (world).
11.4.84	The gods, having surrounded him with these (worlds), brought him to this world.
11.4.85	He did not shine.
11.4.86	They offered five golden coins in the Prayāja offerings.
11.4.87	Gold is splendour.
11.4.88-95	They placed the brilliance in him. Then he indeed grasped the brilliance. He became brilliant in these five directions. This one is silver, that one is golden. He indeed goes to this world, having been surrounded by these two. He does not shine, they say. He does indeed shine.
11.4.96	At the Prayājas, one should offer five golden coins.
11.4.97	Gold is indeed brilliance.
11.4.98	He thus unites him with brilliance.
11.4.99	He becomes brilliant in these five directions.
11.5.1	One desiring Brahmic glory should offer a cake to Soma-Rudra, cooked on white rice, from a white cow with a white calf, and churned ghee.
11.5.2	Svabhanu, the demon, covered the sun with darkness.
11.5.3	He did not shine.
11.5.4	The gods wanted to atone for him.
11.5.5	They offered him this sacrifice.
11.5.6-11	By that he removes darkness from him. He who is covered by darkness, though fit for brahmic lustre, does not have brahmic lustre. He removes darkness from him alone. He unites him with brahmic lustre. The offering is of ghee from a white cow with a white calf, and white grains of rice. Brahmic lustre is like this.
11.5.12	He thus establishes (the sacrificer) in the lustre of Brahman.
11.5.13	They sprinkle with ghee.
11.5.14	They cleanse with ghee.
11.5.15	For non-tranquillity.
11.5.16	For tranquillity are the waters.
11.5.17	They should not bring water to his house on that night.
11.5.18	One should perform the sacrifice in a house surrounded by a wall.
11.5.19	For the purpose of encompassing the lustre of Brahman.
11.5.20	The oblation should be raised to the height of a span. Thus it is raised sideways.
11.5.21	This is the size of a man.
11.5.22	As far as his life is, as far as his self is, so far he removes darkness.
11.5.23	They move together with the rays.
11.5.24	The sun rising from here removes darkness.
11.5.25	One should perform the Tisya and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices.
11.5.26	Tisya is Rudra, the Moon, Soma.
11.5.27	From that, the plants are eastern.
11.5.28	The Raudri ones are western.
11.5.29	They wither eastern.
11.5.30	They wither western.
11.5.31	He prospers them directly.
11.5.32	One who performs this sacrifice becomes the lord of the bad-skinned.
11.5.33	For he destroys them excessively.
11.5.34	One should recite the verses of Manu in the Sāmidhenī verses.
11.5.35	Whatever Manu said was indeed a remedy.
11.5.36	He makes it a remedy for him.
11.5.37	The rivers flow down, being rich in honey.
11.5.38	One should place the Nārāśaṃsa verses.
11.5.39	For peace.
11.5.40	It becomes six-footed.
11.5.41	There are six seasons.
11.5.42	He stands firm in the seasons.
11.5.43	But the lord is indeed very difficult to approach.
11.5.44	For he is indeed ascending the rays.
11.5.45	One desiring cattle should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Soma and Pūṣan.
11.5.46	Soma is indeed the divine deity of the Brahman.
11.5.47	Pūṣan is cattle.
11.5.48	He makes his own deity prosper with cattle.
11.5.49	He makes it skin.
11.5.50	One should offer a cake to Soma and Rudra, using black rice, for the purpose of harming.
11.5.51	Soma is the lord of these creatures.
11.5.52	Rudra is the lord of Agni, the lord of the killed and the unkilled.
11.5.53	Having requested the lord, he places him in Rudra.
11.5.54	It is made of black rice.
11.5.55	Black is like darkness.
11.5.56	Darkness is death.
11.5.57	He binds him with death itself.
11.5.58	The sacrificial grass is made of reeds.
11.5.59	For prosperity.
11.5.60	The kindling wood is of the vaibhītaka tree.
11.5.61	For separation.
11.5.62	One should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Soma-Rudra for enmity or for a second (enemy).
11.5.63	Half of it should be half, all should be all.
11.5.64	Half of the rice should be white, half black. Half of the sacrificial grass should be made of reeds, half of darbha grass. Half of the wood for the fire should be made of the vaibhitaka tree, half of another tree.
11.5.65	Soma is the deity of the Brahman.
11.5.66	He generates a second son in his own deity.
11.5.67	Because it is half and half.
11.5.68	It is for the sake of being a second.
11.5.69	One should offer a cake to Soma-Rudra for one suffering from a disease.
11.5.70	Soma is for the living, Agni for the dead.
11.5.71	He who is suffering from a disease is neither living nor dead.
11.5.72	He redeems him with his own share.
11.5.73	It is in milk.
11.5.74	Milk is milk.
11.5.75	A man is milk.
11.5.76	He who suffers from a disease suffers from milk.
11.5.77	His milk is mixed with milk.
11.5.78	He who becomes the Hotṛ priest, he indeed throws out what has been swallowed by Soma and Rudra.
11.5.79	He is the lord of the two worlds.
11.5.80	One should give a bull to him.
11.5.81	One should kill him.
11.5.82	One may eat of him.
11.5.83	That itself is the atonement there.
11.5.84	One should offer a cake to Soma and Rudra for one who desires offspring or cattle.
11.5.85	Soma indeed is the seed-giver.
11.5.86	Rudra is Agni, he is the begetter.
11.5.87	Soma indeed gives him seed.
11.5.88	Agni begets.
11.5.89	One obtains offspring or cattle, whichever one desires, for which one offers.
11.6.1	One should offer a cake to the Adityas, the upholders, when one is being obstructed or when one is about to be obstructed.
11.6.2	The Adityas are the saviors.
11.6.3	The Adityas are the non-obstructors.
11.6.4	He approaches them with the oblation.
11.6.5	They protect him.
11.6.6	One who desires to prosper should offer cooked rice to the Adityas, the possessors of the world.
11.6.7	Aditi cooked rice for the sake of offspring.
11.6.8	She ate the leftovers.
11.6.9	She conceived.
11.6.10	From that the Adityas were born.
11.6.11	"May those who are better than me be born first, and may I be born last."
11.6.12	She cooked it for herself.
11.6.13	She ate it from both sides, from the front and from above.
11.6.14	She conceived.
11.6.15	The embryo spoke from within.
11.6.16	The Adityas thought,
11.6.17	"This one will be born,
11.6.18	and he alone will be this."
11.6.19	They killed him.
11.6.20	He was expelled and lay down.
11.6.21	She cooked the third (meal).
11.6.22	For the Adityas alone.
11.6.23	"Let it be so, for he from whom you were born, from whom you were created."
11.6.24	They put him together.
11.6.25	What of him was dead, that they removed.
11.6.26	He became an elephant.
11.6.27	What of it was living, that became Vivasvan, the sun.
11.6.28	He did not become as he should have been.
11.6.29	He offered a cake to the Adityas and the Bhuvadvatas.
11.6.30	The Self is the friend of the Self, the most affectionate.
11.6.31	He approached his own (relatives).
11.6.32	Then he became (as he should have been).
11.6.33	The Adityas are these creatures, the friend of the self, the most affectionate of the self.
11.6.34	He approaches his own share.
11.6.35-42	for prosperity. It is indeed so. "He says, "I shall offer a share to the Adityas." He should say while offering. "He should say, "He is going to be known in the family of so-and-so, the son of so-andso, in the family of such-and-such." He says while making a share for them. He offers cooked rice to the Adityasthe Adityas are the divine class.
11.6.43-48	The divine class is the lord of the human class. The divine class alone leads him to the human class. The seven-horse-shaped rays are made. He sprinkles them on the sacrificial post. They lie on the altar when it is set up. When the middle one is set up, he strikes them.
11.6.49	"This do I bind for the Ādityas, for the son of so-and-so, for the sake of his attainment."
11.6.50	If he does not attain them by the seventh day, having made a bundle of them, he should offer with the second and third (offerings).
11.6.51	The Ādityas are three times seven.
11.6.52	He binds as many as there are Ādityas.
11.6.53	They, being bound, release him and make him understand.
11.6.54	The strength of the Vishas indeed departed.
11.6.55	It entered the ashvattha tree.
11.6.56	Therefore it stands with all its leaves falling, not holding them.
11.6.57	When they are ashvattha trees.
11.6.58	He binds strength in them.
11.6.59	"Here is the truth, here is the mind."
11.6.60	One should take the place of the restrained.
11.6.61	He makes them without a mind.
11.6.62	"He should go to them, saying, "O Maruts, come to us with your own power, and with the king who is the lord of the people."
11.6.63	He should go to the people, destroying the wind and the enemy.
11.6.64	He makes them with a mind.
11.6.65	If there is a village-dweller who speaks beyond, they should bring rice from his house."
11.6.66-73	They should search for the white and black ones. Those who are white, one should offer a cake to the Adityas. Those who were black, they should be kept. The Adityas are the divine class. The divine class is the lord of the human class. The human class itself makes him enter the divine class. He has entered this class." They say:
11.6.74	Now, where is the Kshatra?
11.6.75	When one knows the Kshatra, then one knows.
11.6.76	If one were to know (it), one should offer a cake to Varuna to those who are black.
11.6.77	Varuna is the Kshattra.
11.6.78	Varuna himself makes one know the Kshatra.
11.6.79	One knows both the classes, the class of gods and the class of men.
11.6.80	Because he offers to the white ones in the sun,
11.6.81	therefore the Vaishya is born white.
11.6.82	Because to the black ones in the water,
11.6.83	therefore the Kshatriya is born smoky.
11.8.1	One who is going to perform this sacrifice should offer a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni-Vishnu, a cooked oblation to Sarasvati, and a cooked oblation of barley to Brihaspati on the previous day.
11.8.2	Agni is all the deities.
11.8.3	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
11.8.4	Speech is Sarasvati.
11.8.5	Brahma is Brihaspati.
11.8.6	These are the deities that are taken on the previous day.
11.8.7	The deities are the vital airs.
11.8.8	Having taken the vital airs, one observes fast.
11.8.9	One who is suffering from a disease should offer an oblation of eight potfuls to Agni, a rice-cake to Soma, a rice- cake to Aditi, a rice-cakes made of barley to Varuna, and a rice-cake of twelve potfuls to Agni-Vaisvānara.
11.8.10	The flesh of a man who has died goes to Agni.
11.8.11	The juice goes to Soma.
11.8.12	The body goes to the earth.
11.8.13	This is Aditi.
11.8.14	For she is the one on whom one lies.
11.8.15	These are the deities that rule over man.
11.8.16	He makes him move towards them alone.
11.8.17	The living one is indeed connected with Soma.
11.8.18	The dead one is connected with Agni.
11.8.19	The one who is sick is neither living nor dead.
11.8.20	He redeems him with a share of those two.
11.8.21	The one that is sick is seized by Varuna.
11.8.22	The one connected with Varuna.
11.8.23	He releases him from Varuna.
11.8.24	It is made of barley.
11.8.25	It is the size of a span.
11.8.26	The year is Agni Vaiśvānara.
11.8.27	Life is the year.
11.8.28	He establishes him in life itself.
11.8.29	He attains all life.
11.8.30	These are the five oblations.
11.8.31	Man has five parts.
11.8.32	He attains man.
11.8.33	"You are the life of Agni."
11.8.34	He puts gold in ghee.
11.8.35	Gold is born from Agni.
11.8.36	Men are born from Agni. They are the life-givers.
11.8.37	He puts life in him by them.
11.8.38	"He says, "The breath of Indra."
11.8.39	The breaths belong to this deity.
11.8.40	He puts them in him.
11.8.41	The directions belong to this deity
11.8.42	He directs him towards the directions according to the deity.
11.8.43	He offers five times.
11.8.44	Man has five limbs.
11.8.45	He makes him whole.
11.8.46	All the priests offer in succession.
11.8.47	All the rites are performed for him.
11.8.48	They offer in succession at the hand of the Brahman.
11.8.49	Brahman is Brahman.
11.8.50	They make him live for one life by means of Brahman.
11.8.51	"If he does not move, then (he says), "May he move."
11.8.52	This is the birth of ghee, it declares the kinship and power.
11.8.53	With the Pavamāna hymn, he says.
11.8.54	This much is there, as much as the Grahas, Stomas and Chandas.
11.8.55	He treats him with as much as there is.
11.8.56	Just as one takes out, releases, and lifts up a victim, so does he take him out, release him, and lift him up.
11.8.57	"The gods are the life-giving ones."
11.8.58	He gives (the Soma).
11.8.59	These indeed are the gods who give life.
11.8.60	By them he gives him life.
11.8.61	He drinks it.
11.8.62	He drinks life.
11.8.63	Whatever he takes from it, he should take it as if from gold.
11.8.64	Gold is indeed brilliance.
11.8.65	Ghee is life.
11.8.66	He thus places brilliance and life in himself.
11.8.67	"He says, "O Agni, make this (person) live for life and brilliance."
11.8.68	He binds the gold.
11.8.69	Agni is indeed all the deities.
11.8.70	Life is gold.
11.8.71	He binds him with all the deities.
11.8.72	"He binds him with the verse, "O Varuna, thou hast sharpened thy sharp power."
11.8.73	He binds him together.
11.8.74	"He makes him a shelter like his mother Aditi."
11.8.75	This is Aditi.
11.8.76	He establishes him in this very (Aditi).
11.8.77	"The verse, "May the All-gods be as old as the old-sighted one."
11.8.78	He makes him immortal.
11.8.79	The breath of the Asvins, the breath of Mitra-Varuna, the breath of Brihaspati.
11.8.80	These are the deities of the breaths.
11.8.81	He places them in him.
11.8.82	He spreads them over him.
11.8.83	He makes them not to depart from him.
11.10.1	The skin of a black antelope, honey, and the fruits of the Karira tree, and the strap of a black horse.
11.10.2	Having placed them at the end of the eastern Agni, having caused the sacrificer to wear a black garment, and having invoked him, he offers these (oblations).
11.10.3	These are indeed the names of the wind.
11.10.4	This indeed is the lord of the year.
11.10.5	When he swells, when he blows, when he causes to rain, then it rains.
11.10.6	He approaches him with his own share.
11.10.7	He, being pleased, causes him to rain.
11.10.8	He offers eight times.
11.10.9	There are eight directions and eight sub-directions.
11.10.10	He thus causes rain to fall in the directions.
11.10.11	He mixes it with black antelope skin.
11.10.12	He makes it an oblation.
11.10.13	He mixes with honey.
11.10.14	Honey is indeed the juice of water and plants.
11.10.15	He causes rain from water and plants.
11.10.16	When it rains, he directs the rain to the plants from the water.
11.10.17	"Manda, Vasha."
11.10.18	These are the names of the waters.
11.10.19	As he says:
11.10.20	"Come, O Asa, come, O Asa."
11.10.21	In this way, he directs them to the sky by their names.
11.10.22	"No other."
11.10.23	They say:
11.10.24	The Somiya Ahuti is capable of causing rain from heaven.
11.10.25	The Yatis were eaten by the Salavrikas.
11.10.26	Their heads fell down.
11.10.27	They became Kharjuras.
11.10.28	The Soma-drink fell upwards.
11.10.29	They became Kariras.
11.10.30	When Kariras are eaten,
11.10.31	the Somiya Ahuti causes rain from heaven.
11.10.32-41	Therefore, one should not give the karīra fruit to a woman. One should not give it to a Śūdra. Because he does not drink Soma. You are the gift of Indra. I bind you for rain. Because the horse is a bull. Because Parjanya is a bull. For prosperity. The rope of the black horse is made. Because he becomes like a black horse when it is going to rain.
11.10.42-49	The Vasus are the gods. The Sharmanis are the gods. The gods are the drinkers of the same drink. These are the deities who rule over the rain. It is with them that he desires rain for him every day. He puts on a black antelope skin. The black antelope skin is the form of the Rg and the Sama. With the Rg and Sama, he desires rain for himself.
11.10.50-57	If it rains, then he should perform the Iṣṭi. If it does not rain, then they should stay like that. Indeed, Mitra and Varuna are day and night. Parjanya rains according to day and night. It rains either at night or during the day. These two are the lords of rain. One approaches them with the same oblation. They, being pleased, bestow rain on him.
11.10.58	One should offer a cake on eight potsherds to Agni Dhāmacchādha, a rice-pap to Maruts and a cake on one potsherd to Surya.
11.10.59	Agni causes rain to fall from here.
11.10.60	Having become like the one who covers the abode, he causes rain to fall.
11.10.61	The Maruts cause the rain that has been released to flow.
11.10.62	When the sun turns back with its rays, then it rains.
11.10.63	These are the deities who rule over the year.
11.10.64	He approaches them with the same share.
11.10.65	They, being pleased with him, send down rain.
11.10.66	If it is not raining, he offers these six oblations when it is raining.
11.10.67	There are six seasons.
11.10.68	He releases rain from the seasons.
11.10.69	What is the seventh?
11.10.70	By this (rite) he causes rain to cease in a year.
11.10.71	Now these four Marutīya rites for the Pitrs, of them one performs with three, and puts aside one. The verses are the Anuvākyā, the Yajus is the Yājyā.
11.10.72	The Maruts indeed rule over rain.
11.10.73	He thus makes a greater share for them.
11.10.74	The one which is the fourth, that one he offers when the water has settled.
11.10.75	"Pour forth rain from heaven."
11.10.76	"He says, 'Satisfy the ocean with waters.'
11.10.77	He satisfies the waters with the ocean.
11.10.78	He unites these and those.
11.10.79	'Those gods who have a share in heaven.'
11.10.80	He shakes the black antelope skin.
11.10.81	He satisfies the directions and the deities.
11.10.82	And these worlds of his become desired and pleased.
11.10.83	This is the Kariri sacrifice.
11.10.84	One who performs this sacrifice should not eat karira fruits for a year.
11.10.85	This is the vow of this sacrifice.
12.1.1	One should perform the Payasya sacrifice for the removal of disease.
12.1.2	The Maitravaruni sacrifice should be performed by a Brahmin, the Indravaruni by a Kshatriya and the Agnivaruni by a Vaishya.
12.1.3	The Agni sacrifice is for prosperity.
12.1.4	Maitra, the Brahman, is the deity.
12.1.5	This one who is afflicted by disease is seized by Varuna.
12.1.6	He approaches his own deity with the sacrificial portion.
12.1.7	He frees him from Varuna with the Varuna rite.
12.1.8	The king, the son of Indra, is the deity
12.1.9	This one who afflicted by disease is afflicted by Varuna. He approaches his own deity
12.1.10	with the sacrificial portion.
12.1.11	He releases him from Varuna with the Varuna-rite.
12.1.12	Agni is all the deities.
12.1.13	There, the one who is afflicted by disease is also released from Varuna.
12.1.14	He approaches his own deity with the sacrificial offering.
12.1.15	He releases him from Varun with the Varuna rite.
12.1.16	It is a Payasyā (rite).
12.1.17	Payasya means milk.
12.1.18	Milk is a man.
12.1.19-26	He offers milk to her in whose house he offers. He wins his milk with milk. It is a cake. Having made him firm, he establishes him. A man is an animal. A cake is an animal. He wins the animal with the animal. He offers after having arranged (the oblations).
12.1.27	Just as a surgeon removes a dart by probing for it, so does he remove the consumption from the middle of him.
12.1.28	He offers the Avadha to Agni in the middle.
12.1.29	Just as a surgeon removes the dart, and then binds and dresses the wound, so does he do that.
12.1.30	Now these are the single-skull (offerings).
12.1.31	One should not offer a man with skulls.
12.1.32	He offers him only once.
12.1.33	There are eight of them.
12.1.34	There are eight kinds of hair on a man.
12.1.35	He obtains him through the hair.
12.1.36	He offers them in succession.
12.1.37	The noose of Varuna is here and there.
12.1.38	Wherever the noose of Varuni is, he releases him from there.
12.1.39	The offering is defective if one offers it in a place without fire.
12.1.40	All offerings should be made in fire.
12.1.41	Agni is all the deities.
12.1.42	He obtains those very objects.
12.1.43	One does not offer a burnt oblation.
12.1.44	One should perform the Payasya sacrifice for the sake of progeny.
12.1.45	The Agniya (rite) is indeed successful.
12.1.46	The Brahmanical deity is Mitra.
12.1.47	He who is unable to be with his own kinsmen, though he is capable of being with them, is seized by Varuna.
12.1.48	He approaches his own deity with the sacrificial offering.
12.1.49-59	He releases him with the Varuna-rite from Varuna. It is a Payasyā (rite). Payasyā means milk. Milk is the commoner. He wins milk with milk. He arranges (the offerings). He satisfies the directions. He gathers (the offerings). He gathers the commoners for him. The Brahmanas have a common skull. One desiring cattle should offer a Payasyā sacrifice.
12.1.60	By means of prosperity, Agni is the deity.
12.1.61	Maitra is the Brahmanical deity.
12.1.62	He who is capable of having cattle but does not have cattle is seized by Varuna.
12.1.63	He approaches his own deity with the sacrificial portion.
12.1.64	He releases him from Varuna with the Varuna rite.
12.1.65	It is a Payasyā (rite).

12.1.69	He arranges.
12.1.70	He satisfies the directions.
12.1.71	He gathers.
12.1.72	He gathers cattle for him.
12.1.73	The Brahmana of the single-headed ones is the same.
12.1.74	One who desires prosperity should offer a sacrifice with milk.
12.1.75	The Agniya (rite) is indeed prosperity.
12.1.76	The Brahmanas are the deity.
12.1.77	He who is seized by Varuna, though he is capable of prosperity, does not prosper.
12.1.78	He approaches his own deity with the sacrificial portion.
12.1.79	He frees him from Varuna with the Varuna rite.
12.1.80	It becomes Payasyā.
12.1.81	Payasyā is milk.
12.1.82	Man is milk.
12.1.83	He obtains milk with milk.
12.1.84	He arranges (the oblations).
12.1.85	He satisfies the directions.
12.1.86	He gathers (the oblations)
12.1.87	He bestows prosperity on him.
12.1.88	The Brahman is the same for those with one skull.
12.2.1	You are firm.
12.2.2	May I be firm among my kinsmen, and may my kinsmen be firm in me.
12.2.3	You are the fierce one, the one who knows wealth.
12.2.4	You are victorious.
12.2.5	May I prevail over my kinsmen.
12.2.6	You are steadfast, the one who bestows wealth.
12.2.7-13	You are the overlord. May I be the overlord of my kinsmen. The brave one, the protector, the bestower of wealth. You are the wise one. May I, the wise one, be the overlord among my kinsmen. The brave one, the wise one. The brave one. The brave, the protector, the bestower of wealth, the wise one The gods who are united, of one mind, whom I desire with my heart, may they desire me with their hearts. May they be of one mind with me. Svāhā.
12.2.14	The goddesses, the women, who are of one mind, whom I desire with my heart, may they desire me with their hearts. May they make me of one mind with them. Svāhā.
12.2.15	The gods, the sons, the cattle, who are of the same mind, whom I long for with my heart, let them long for me with their hearts, and may they make me of the same mind with them.
12.2.16	The gods and the Asuras were in conflict.
12.2.17	The Asuras were more intelligent.
12.2.18	The gods were as if without minds.
12.2.19	The gods saw this means of capturing.
12.2.20	By it they captured the minds of the Asuras.
12.2.21	Then indeed they became without minds.
12.2.22	One captures one's enemy's mind.
12.2.23	He becomes without mind and is defeated.
12.2.24	One should offer with this for the sake of cattle.
12.2.25	By this indeed the gods captured the cattle of the Asuras.
12.2.26	Then indeed those cattle were defeated.
12.2.27	He seizes the cattle of his enemy.
12.2.28	His cattle are defeated.
12.2.29	One who desires cattle should offer with this (rite).
12.2.30	The mind is seized, as it were, by one's own kinsmen.
12.2.31	He seizers the minds of all his kinsmen.
12.2.32	They do not drive him away, having their minds seized.
12.2.33-41	The Vaiśvadeva (rite) should be performed. For the Vaiśvadeva rite is for all kinsmen. When milk is milked from a cow with a calf of the same colour, it becomes (fit to be offered). For the cow with a calf is Vaiśvadevī. They collect ghee from all kinsmen. For the Vaiśvadev rite. For the rite of Vaiśvadeva is for all kinsman. "He says, "You are firm." He places the pots around.
12.2.42	He places them on the same level.
12.2.43	"The gods are united."
12.2.44	Having made the offering, he says,
12.2.45	"The mind is grasped, just as the women are united, just as the men are united, just like the boys are united."
12.2.46	He grasps the minds of all his relatives.
12.2.47	They do not abandon him, being thus grasped by the mind.
12.2.48	He who offers the oblations between the Prayājas and Anuyājas, cuts off the sacrifice.
12.2.49	They should be offered when the sacrifice is completed.
12.2.50	If one were to offer them when the sacrifice is not completed, one would exclude oneself from one's kinsmen.
12.2.51	One should offer them between the Prayāja and Anuyāja offerings.
12.2.52	The Prayāja offerings are the vital breaths.
12.2.53	The Anuyāja offerings are the out-breaths.
12.2.54	The oblation is the self.
12.2.55	He places the relatives in the middle of himself.
12.2.56	If one desires, one should offer with a wooden (implement).
12.2.57	"If one desires, "May the relatives come quickly."
12.2.58	They go away quickly again."
12.2.59	Thus indeed, the trees are unsteady, moving and unmoving.
12.2.60	If one wishes, one should offer on clay (implement).
12.2.61	If one desires: "May the relatives come for a long time."
12.2.62	They went away again after a long time.
12.2.63	Thus indeed this (earth) is firmly established, as if moving and unmoving.
12.3.1	Indra took up the thunderbolt against Vritra.
12.3.2	He said:
12.3.3	"This power is in me.
12.3.4	I shall give it to you.
12.3.5	Do not strike me."
12.3.6	He gave it to him.
12.3.7	He knew:
12.3.8	"Is there any strength in him?"
12.3.9	He gave him the second, he gave him the third.
12.3.10	He said:
12.3.11	"There is strength in me.
12.3.12	I will give it to you.
12.3.13	Do not strike me."
12.3.14	He gave it to him.
12.3.15	He gave him a sacrifice.
12.3.16	He gave a sacrifice.
12.3.17	To Indra he gave.
12.3.18-26	Therefore the offering to Indra-Vishnu is made. He gave him his own strength. It became powerless and was laid down. Vishnu followed it with his strength. He said, "Give me once, O Vishnu! Give me twice, O Vishnu! Give me thrice, O Vishnu!" That is why it is called "to be performed three times."
12.3.27	Indra, having killed Vritra, threw him into the human corpse.
12.3.28	Soma is Vritra's belly.
12.3.29	The human corpse is the belly.
12.3.30	Therefore Soma is drunk in the belly.
12.3.31	That is why they say:
12.3.32	"Vritra is killed, he is spread out."
12.3.33	The sacrifice fled from the Asuras.
12.3.34	Having placed the vessels on his lap, he makes this form, and the oblations are scattered.
12.3.35	He returned to Indra.
12.3.36	Indra performed a sacrifice with it.
12.3.37	Then the gods became (victorious),
12.3.38	and the Asuras became (defeated).
12.3.39	He who, knowing this, performs a sacrifice with this (form), becomes victorious, and his enemy becomes defeated.
12.3.40	The sacrifice came (to him).
12.3.41	He approached Indra.
12.3.42	Therefore the offering to Indra-Vishnu is made.
12.3.43	He first gave him the verses, then the Sama hymns, then the Yajus mantras.
12.3.44	This is the source of Brahman.
12.3.45	From this everything was created - verses, Sama hymns, Stotras, Yajus mantra.
12.3.46	One attains the source of Brahman.
12.3.47-54	He passes over all this. The Srīñjayas performed this sacrifice. They passed over all this. But it was not long before they were deprived of it. Therefore, one should not use it again and again. One who performs this sacrifice severs the continuity (of the sacrifice). One should perform this sacrifice even for one's son. For the continuity.
12.3.55	By the power of this (Agni) Vritra grows higher and higher every day by the length of an arrow, and by the length of the arrow across.
12.3.56	And what he breathes out, that does not return to him again.
12.3.57	He who, knowing this, offers with this (Agni), grows in offspring and in cattle.
12.3.58	One should offer for all desires.
12.3.59	This sacrifice is indeed all.
12.3.60	For all the desires, a sacrifice is performed.
12.3.61	One should perform a sacrifice for subjugation.
12.3.62	One should not give a gift.
12.3.63	One should employ him after making him a debtor,
12.3.64	because a debtor is one who does not give gifts.
12.4.1	One who desires prosperity should offer three oblations.
12.4.2	There are three worlds.
12.4.3	Having obtained these worlds, he obtains strength and power.
12.4.4	The northern one is the greater.
12.4.5	For the northern one is the greatest of these worlds. They are in order.
12.4.6	For thus are these worlds.
12.4.7	There are twelve potsherds.
12.4.8	For there are three sets of four.
12.4.9	For prosperity.
12.4.10	He offers the oblation of all (worlds) together.
12.4.11	The Chāmbata is the first.
12.4.12	He who does not censure, he does the Chāmbata.
12.4.13	The Chāmbata does not move for him.
12.4.14	The first is made of barley, then of barley, then made of barley.
12.4.15	Barley is like red (colour).
12.4.16	This world is like red.
12.4.17	That one is like red. (The Chāmbara)
12.4.18	Barley is white.
12.4.19	The space is like white.
12.4.20	The worlds are connected by the sky.
12.4.21	For the connection of these worlds.
12.4.22	One should not make the best offering of rice-gruel.
12.4.23	For the non-diminution of the cattle.
12.4.24	Three cows are the fee.
12.4.25	Three oblations of ghee.
12.4.26	Three golden coins.
12.4.27	This is the form of the Yajus, that the oblations of ghee are scattered.
12.4.28	The golden coins are of the Samaveda.
12.4.29-37	The Chhandas are the cows. These are the forms of the sacrifice. One wins the sacrifice by means of the forms. The garment is dedicated to all the gods. When one gives garments, one wins all the gods. The gold is brilliance and brahminical lustre. When one offers gold, one wins brilliance and brahminic lustre.
12.4.38	The cow is the three-fold prosperity, the self is the calf, and the milk is the gift.
12.4.39	What the cow gives.
12.4.40	It makes him three-fold prosperous.
12.4.41	One should recite all the metres.
12.4.42	This sacrifice is all.
12.4.43	All the metres are recited in the Soma sacrifice.
12.4.44	The womb of that sacrifice which was created, followed it.
12.4.45	That became the Tarpya.
12.4.46	The sacrifice is threefold.
12.4.47	When the Tarpya is worn by the sacrificer,
12.4.48	he anoints himself with his own womb.
12.4.49	One should recite the Ushnih and Kakubha verses in the Sami-dheni verses.
12.4.50	The Kakubha is the Uṣṇīha, the Kakubha is strength, the Uṣṇiha is the Kakubha.
12.4.51	He indeed wins them with strength.
12.4.52	One should not place (the bricks) with the Jagati.
12.4.53	This is the end of the metres.
12.4.54	One would go to the end.
12.4.55	One would cut off the sacrifice.
12.4.56	"O Agni, thy three powers, thy three abodes."
12.4.57	He places (the bricks) in the Tristubh metre.
12.4.58	The Tristubh has strength and vigour. It goes to the end.
12.4.59	He establishes him in strength and vigour.
12.5.1	The gods went to the abode of the Asuras.
12.5.2	Indra did not go there.
12.5.3	Their powers fled from them. Agni's Rathantera, Indra's Brihat, the Vaimara of the All-gods, the Sakvari of the Maruts, the Revatis of Tvashtri.
12.5.4	Indra followed them as they were fleeing.
12.5.5	He saw this Indra-rite with twelve potsherds.
12.5.6	By it he regained those powers and manly virtues.
12.5.7	Then he became.
12.5.8	Then the gods followed him.
12.5.9	One who desires to prosper should offer with this Indra-offering on twelve potsherds.
12.5.10	He obtains these very organs and powers.
12.5.11	One becomes.
12.5.12	One's own beings follow him.
12.5.13	It is on twelve potsherards.
12.5.14	For the sake of being all-divine.
12.5.15	He places it on the skulls with palms upwards.
12.5.16	He makes a cake.
12.5.17	For peace.
12.5.18	For non-burning.
12.5.19	All these are the organs, the powers, which are the backs.
12.5.20	They, the lords, the unfixed ones, would destroy him.
12.5.21	One should omit the Yajya and Anuvakya.
12.5.22	"Recite to Indra Rathantara."
12.5.23	Having recited the Rathantara Sāman, one should offer with a verse of the Brihat Sāman.
12.5.24	"Recite for Indra in the Brihat Sãman."
12.5.25	Having recited the Brihat Sâman, one should make an offering with a verse of Rathantara Sâman.
12.5.26	"Say, 'Recite for Indra of the Vaimāta Sāman.'"
12.5.27	Having recited the Vaimānta Sāman, make an offering with the verse of the Vaimata Sāman. Recite for Indra of Vaimānta.
12.5.28	"Reciting for Indra of the Vairaj Sāman, say, 'Recite the Vairaj Sãman.'"
12.5.29	Having recited the Vedic verse of Vairas, one should offer oblation with the Vedic verse of Vairu.
12.5.30	"Recite, 'For Indra Shakra'."
12.5.31	Having recited the Shakvari verse, one should offer with the Revati verse.
12.5.32	"Recitate, 'For Indra Revata'."
12.5.33	Having recited Revati, one should offer Shakvari.
12.5.34	One attains oneself with these very powers of Indra.
12.5.35	For the one without a path.
12.5.36	One should not make the Vasat-call with the Brihatī (metre).
12.5.37	The offspring of beings follow the Brihatī.
12.5.38	One would destroy procreation.
12.5.39	The Brihatī is cattle.
12.5.40	Rudra is Agni.
12.5.41	One would give cattle to Rudra.
12.5.42	One would become without cattle.
12.5.43	One should not exceed the number of four syllables in the Anuvākyā (verse) while reciting the Yajyā (verse).
12.5.44	Thus the Anushtubh and the Paṅkti are accomplished.
12.5.45	The Anushtubh should be the Anuvākyā and the Paṅktis the Yājyā for one desiring offspring or cattle.
12.5.46	Prajapati was here.
12.5.47	His second was speech.
12.5.48	They became a pair.
12.5.49	She conceived.
12.5.50	She departed from him.
12.5.51	She created these offspring.
12.5.52	She again enters Prajapati.
12.5.53	If the Anuvakya is in Anushtubh, the Yajya is in Paṅkti.
12.5.54	Anushtubh is speech.
12.5.55	Paṅkti is the year.
12.5.56	Prajapati is the year. 
12.5.57	He creates the bull of the year in speech.
12.5.58	He makes it a pair with him.
12.5.59	One should offer the Puronuvakya around the entire Puronuvakyasya.
12.5.60	With these very senses and powers, he encloses himself all around.
12.5.61	For covering.
12.5.62	One should offer sacrifice with this (verse) to one who has been accused of killing.
12.5.63	The gods do not eat the food of one who has been falsely accused of killing. When they eat his food,
12.5.64	the gods avoid him, and men do not eat his food.
12.5.65	Therefore, if someone were to praise him falsely, he should not eat his food.
12.5.66	All the pages are dedicated to all the gods.
12.5.67	If one performs the sacrifice with all the pages,
12.5.68	the gods themselves consume his food.
12.5.69	The pure and tasty food is eaten by humans.
12.5.70	This is the sacrifice called Sarvaprstha.
12.5.71	One becomes the best among equals if one who knows this performs this sacrifice.
12.6.1-7	A horse should not be accepted. It is both. One who accepts it takes away the strength and energy of this (horse). Therefore, it should not be accepted.
12.6.8-15	He should offer this oblation to Varuna. For the purpose of being free from Varuna. If one were to accept a horse, he should offer this obltion to Varuna. For the purpose of being freed from Varuna. It is offered on four potsherds. The horse has four feet. He directly frees him from the noose of Varuna. They say:
12.6.16	But he is not released from the others by that by which he is released from one.
12.6.17	One should offer as many oblations of four spoonfuls as horses one would take.
12.6.18	Here, here is the noose of Varuna.
12.6.19	Wherever there is the noose, from there Varuna releases him.
12.6.20	One becomes superior.
12.6.21	He releases him from that very thing which does not afflict him.
12.6.22	And he releases him from what is to come.
12.6.23	Varuna seizes him more when he, having performed this sacrifice, takes another horse.
12.6.24	If one is going to take another horse, one should perform the Sūrya-Varuṇa sacrifice.
12.6.25	He thus takes possession of this world, with the sun as the deity.
12.6.26	He releases him from Varuna with the Varuna rite.
12.6.27	The oblation to the grandson of the waters is also performed.
12.6.28	The horse is born in the waters, without a womb.
12.6.29	Having made him one with a womb, he establishes him.
12.6.30	There are twenty-one kindling verses.
12.6.31	The year consists of twenty-one parts.
12.6.32	There are five seasons.
12.6.33	There are twelve months.
12.6.34	There are three worlds.
12.6.35	This is the twenty-one-fold Aditya.
12.6.36	This is Prajapati.
12.6.37	The horse is Prajapati's.
12.6.38	One attains the horse.
12.6.39	O king Varuna, the noose of the Gayatri metre, that I have released, to that one, svāhā.
12.6.40-44	"O king Varuna, the Triṣṭubh metre, the Jagat metre, the Anusṭubh metre are thy bonds. I have released that one from them. Svāhā!" These are the metres. The bonds of Varuna are the metres. He who is bound by Varuna is bound by them. Here is the bond of Varuna.
12.6.45	Wherever there is the noose of Varuna, from there he is released from Varuna.
12.6.46	The two are in the waters.
12.6.47	With those two noose of water, he releases him.
12.6.48	He offers six times.
12.6.49	There are six seasons.
12.6.50	He indeed stands firm in the seasons.
12.7.1	The gods, when the plants were ripe, fought.
12.7.2	Indra knew this.
12.7.3	"He said, "Agni will conquer."
12.7.4	He said,
12.7.5	"The one who does not conquer, let him join us."
12.7.6	Agni conquered first.
12.7.7	Indra conquered after him.
12.7.8	Therefore, the Agni-Indra and Indra-Agni should be performed.
12.7.9	For Agni conquered first,
12.7.10	and Indra conquered after him.
12.7.11	The Abhijit is the first of the Grahayans.
12.7.12	It is performed with twelve potsherds.
12.7.13	For one conquers the year by this.
12.7.14	There are seventeen Samidheni verses.
12.7.15	For one overcomes the year by this (rite).
12.7.16	In those days there was one kind of barley, one kind of wheat, one kind of peas, one kind of sesamum.
12.7.17	The All-gods said:
12.7.18-27	Let us have a share. We shall spread this. They made this share for them. Then indeed this spread. To Bhuma. To Visvedevas. One spreads with this. It is in milk. For the sake of being for the Visvedevas. For milk is for the Visvedeva. Or this said:
12.7.28-36	In me indeed he cooks with the rain, and with the two (cows) he says, 'We shall be released by truth.' They made this share for him. One-potful. For stability. Of heaven and earth. Some plants are of the village, others are of the forest. They are pleased with him by this (offering). Soma is the king of plants.
12.7.37	This is his redemption, namely, what is grown without ploughing.
12.7.38	This is his redemption.
12.7.39	This is the share itself.
12.7.40	What is wild, that is made superior by this.
12.7.41	What is grown by ploughing, that is made inferior by this.
12.7.42	A calf is the sacrificial fee.
12.7.43	For indeed this is semen, when it is not yet generated.
12.7.44	For generation.
12.7.45	He is consecrated for everything when he consecrates the Āgrayana.
12.7.46	It occurs in the Rājasūya.
12.7.47	He obtains food.
12.7.48	His food becomes tasty and liked.
12.7.49	He who has established the sacred fires is brought to the gods.
12.7.50	They eat his food.
12.7.51	If one were to eat the new grain without having offered the Aggrayaṇa oblation, one would be eating the share of the gods that has been set aside.
12.7.52	One would incur misfortune.
12.7.53	Therefore, one should not eat the new grain until having offered the Aggaṇya oblation.
12.7.54	Indeed, by this (oblation) the gods attained the foremost position.
12.7.55	That is why the Aggrayaṇā is called Aggrayaṇa.
12.7.56	He who, knowing this, offers the Aggrayaņa oblation, attains the foremost position among his equals.
12.8.1	The metres of him who performs the Soma sacrifice are worn out in a year.
12.8.2	The Devīkas are the metres.
12.8.3	He makes the metres worn out and going again.
12.8.4	The Prsthya is the fee for the unfettered.
12.8.5	This is the direction.
12.8.6	He is consecrated in the direction.
12.8.7	It is the direction that he makes for him.
12.8.8	One desiring cattle should sacrifice with the Devakas.
12.8.9	The Devakas are the metres.
12.8.10	The metres are a pair.
12.8.11	The Gāyatrī is Anumati.
12.8.12	The Rākā is the Tristubh.
12.8.13	The Sinīvālī is the Jagatī.
12.8.14	The Kuhū is the Anuṣṭubh.
12.8.15	Dhatā is the Vasat-call.
12.8.16	What are two lower and two higher, that is a pair.
12.8.17	What is Dhatā and the Vasat-calling, that is a couple.
12.8.18	Therefore, from that very pair, he generates cattle.
12.8.19	The full moon that comes first is Anumati.
12.8.20	The full-moon that comes later is Raka.
12.8.21	The new moon that comes first, is Sinivali.
12.8.22	The new-moon that comes last is Kuhu.
12.8.23	The moon itself is the dispenser.
12.8.24	When the moon is full in one place and deficient in another, that is the pair.
12.8.25	What the others see, and not the others, that is the pair.
12.8.26	What is born from the moon on the new moon day, that is the couple.
12.8.27	From that very couple he begets cattle.
12.8.28	One desiring offspring should offer to the Devakas.
12.8.29	One should make Dhatri the last.
12.8.30	Devakas are women.
12.8.31	Dhatri is a man.
12.8.32-38	The offspring of others deposit semen. It is deposited in the offspring of others. They say: One does not deposit it in others, if it is deposited in the east. One should deposit the semen in the east. It is deposited in the eastern direction. One should not deposit it in the east. One should deposit it in the west. One should place the semen in the west. It is deposited on the western side. One should put the semen in the western direction. It is deposited towards the west. It is placed in the western direction.
12.8.39	Women lead him to the rear.
12.8.40	If he is born, one should offer this oblation after having placed the deity Dhātar in front.
12.8.41	He leads him to the front.
12.8.42	One should offer to Devīkā if one is afflicted with disease.
12.8.43	One should place the deity Dhātara in the middle.
12.8.44	Dhātar is indeed the year.
12.8.45	The year is indeed the one who is greedy for him, and then he is afflicted with disease.
12.8.46	Having thus made the year his middle, he again generates him from this pair.
12.8.47	The controlling powers of these metres, being uncontrolled, would have destroyed him.
12.8.48	One should offer a sacrifice to the animal.
12.8.49	For peace.
12.8.50	For non-destruction.
12.8.51	Some animals are heroic, others are not.
12.8.52	Some are heroic, others not.
12.8.53	Those who are the oblations in front are the ones who are with heroes.
12.8.54	Those who are the oblatioins in the back are the ones who do not have heroes.
12.8.55	Those in front who are eating are the ones who stand up.
12.8.56	Those in the back who do not have the heroes are the ones who go away.
12.8.57	Those who have the oblations in the front are the ones with heroes.
12.8.58	They are established in Prajapati.
12.8.59	In those pots where there is Soma, one should make Devaki.
12.8.60-66	Soma is the seed-giver. One should offer to the goddesses of all the Vedas. One who gives everything is deprived of cattle. The goddesses are the Vedas. Cattle are the Vedas. Here one sees the last cattle, where one divides them. Where one sees the last ones, there one again generates them.
12.8.67	He who performs a Soma sacrifice should perform it with Devakā.
12.8.68	Devakā is the Vedas.
12.8.69	He makes the Vedas come back again and again.
12.9.1	I offer thee with the sweet, with the intense, with the divine, with the bright, with the immortal, with the nectar. Thou art Soma. Be cooked for the Asvins. Be cooked for Sarasvati. Be cooked for Indra, the holder of the golden yoke. May the daughter of Surya purify thy Soma that hath flowed away with her eternal power.
12.9.2	The wind is purified by the purifying (wind), Soma has been pressed beyond (its) limit, Indra's friend is yoked.
12.9.3	O Angiras, the drinkers of Yava, as they drink Yava in due order, do you here and there prepare their food, those who have not come to the offering of homage to the sacrificial grass.
12.9.4	You are taken with the Upayāma formula. I take you, the unpierced one, with the unpierced (Soma), dear to the Asvins. This is your birthplace. For the Asvins, you are taken with the Upāṁśu formula. I take thee, the unpierched one, with the pierced one, dear to Sarasvati. This is thy birthplace. For Sarasvati, thou art taken with the Upāmśu formula. Thee, the unpiereced one, with the piercing one, dear to Indra, the holder of the bolt. This is thy birth-place. For Indra, the holder, thee. Sweet for thee, the sweet one. He unites her with Brahman. She dwells for three nights, united. For three nights Soma is bought and dwells. Cook for the Asvins, cook for Sarasvati, cook for Indra, the holder. For these deities she is cooked. Wind is purified by the purifier. One should purify the one who has fallen from the ritual with this. One Puroruk (verse) is recited. He places his power in one (verse). The Anirukta (verse) is Prajapati's. Anirukta is Prajapati. He attains Prajapati.
12.10.1	Viśvarūpa, the son of Tvaṣṭṛ, was the Asuras' cousin. He had three heads.
12.10.2	He drank Soma with one head.
12.10.3	He ate food with another.
12.10.4	He drank wine with another.
12.10.5	Indra thought,
12.10.6	"This one will be that one."
12.10.7	He got it through him.
12.10.8	Through him, he obtained the Yugashara.
12.10.9	He said to the carpenter who was standing,
12.10.10	"Cut off these heads!"
12.10.11	The carpenter, running up to him, cut off the heads with an axe.
12.10.12	From that the head of the carpenter was held.
12.10.13	Therefore, his food is not to be eaten.
12.10.14	What was his drinking of Soma became the Kapinjala.
12.10.15	What was eating of food became the Tittiri.
12.10.16	The one who drank the Soma was the Kalaviṅka.
12.10.17	Therefore he speaks as if he were always fasting.
12.10.18	Tvaṣṭa, having killed his son, brought Soma, the Vīndra,
12.10.19	He churned it out from under a thousand-roofed house.
12.10.20	Then they say:
12.10.21	"It was churned out from under a hundred-roofed house."
12.10.22	Indra took it away by force and drank it through a pipe.
12.10.23	He became exhausted by drinking Soma everywhere.
12.10.24	Therefore Soma is not drunk without being invoked.
12.10.25	One becomes incapable of drinking Soma.
12.10.26	What was his nose became the lion.
12.10.27	What was from his eyes became the tiger.

12.10.31	What is the second, that is the Badara.
12.10.32	What is the third, that is the Karkandhu.
12.10.33	The Asvins healed him.
12.10.34	They sacrificed to him with this Sautrāmaṇī.
12.10.35	He recovered from those very powers with which he had become ill, and restored them to him.
12.10.36	One should sacrifice with this for one whom Soma has passed over.
12.10.37	The Soma indeed flows over him who is deprived of vigour.
12.10.38	He places in him as much vigour as there is.
12.10.39	This (Soma-sacrifice) is also performed at the Rajasuya.
12.10.40	He who is consecrated with the Rajasuya is deprived of vigour,
12.10.41	for he slays Vritra.
12.10.42	He places as much vigour in him as there is.
12.10.43	One who is desirous of prosperity, whether a Brāhmaṇa or a Kṣatriya, should perform this sacrifice.
12.10.44	This is the extent of power.
12.10.45	He places in him as much power as there is.
12.10.46	They say:
12.10.47	This is a sacrifice for the distressed. One should not perform it for one who is not distressed.
12.10.48	They say
12.10.49	One should perform it.
12.10.50	For every man is distressed.
12.10.51	Everyone desires prosperity.
12.10.52	Therefore one should sacrifice.
12.10.53	What is the Asvin?
12.10.54	Because the Asvins were healed.
12.10.55	What is Sarasvata?
12.10.56	Sarasvati is speech.
12.10.57	Because he was healed by speech.
12.10.58	What is Indra?
12.10.59	Because Indra gave him that strength.
12.10.60	One performs the Asvin with kuvalasaktu.
12.10.61	One performs Indra with badarasaktu.
12.10.62	With Karkandhu and barley-meal, one should offer to Sarasvati.
12.10.63	Sarasvati is speech.
12.10.64	One makes her taste his speech.
12.10.65	And she, Sarasvati, speaks to him again what is good, if he speaks to her what is bad.
12.10.66	The Adhvaryu should meditate on the lion in his mind.
12.10.67	The Pratiprasthata on the tiger.
12.10.68	The sacrificer on the wolf.
12.10.69	One becomes a Sura.
12.10.70	With the very same powers with which he is obstructed, having obtained them, he bestows them on him.
12.11.1	One should place the head of a Brahmin.
12.11.2	By that one becomes pure.
12.11.3	Food is indeed Sura.
12.11.4	Food is pure.
12.11.5	By that, one becomes pure. 
12.11.6	One is the Puroruk (verse),
12.11.7	One is the Yajya (verse).
12.11.8	He bestows power in him by means of one alone.
12.11.9	One offers everything as oblation.
12.11.10	He places all his energy in it.
12.11.11	One should make a brahmin drink it.
12.11.12	With that oblation, one performs.
12.11.13	One should drink it oneself.
12.11.14	One places energy in oneself.
12.11.15	That is not to be guarded.
12.11.16	Surā is sin.
12.11.17	One who drinks it is seized by sin in the middle.
12.11.18	He releases him from sin in the middle.
12.11.19-26	If one offers to the northern fire, one does not turn away from sin. A remedy is performed. If one offers to the southern fire, One turns away from sin. A remedy is performed. If one scatters (the ashes), For this indeed flows away. Whatever of this one was afflicted, whatever one was afflicted with, that one goes to the ancestors.

12.11.35	He wins the very life-force itself.
12.11.36	One buys the caul from a eunuch with lead.
12.11.37	A eunuch is untruth.
12.11.38	Lead is untruth. 
12.11.39	Wine is untruth.  
12.11.40	One buys untruth from untruth.
12.11.41	A mare is the fee.
12.11.42	It is a female horse.
12.11.43	Wine is like a female horse.  
12.11.44	For prosperity.
12.12.1	One should offer a goat to Indra, a sheep to Sarasvati, a bull or a heifer to Indra.
12.12.2	They perform in this very way with the omentum offerings.
12.12.3	If the omentum offering to Indra is the last one,
12.12.4	then Indra indeed prevails over him.
12.12.5	If they perform with the first one again, after having performed,
12.12.6	then they obtain Indra again.
12.12.7	For the sake of being with Indra.

12.12.20	Or it was created last, with the head turned towards the west.
12.12.21	If the cakes are placed above,
12.12.22	it is for the purpose of covering.
12.12.23	For the purpose of being without a hole.
12.12.24	It becomes together with the Samvartana.
12.12.25	They invoke the Iḍa together.
12.12.26	For the sake of union.
12.12.27	And also for the sake of the Iḍa not being lost.
12.12.28	Whatever is not opposed to the Sautrāmaṇī, that is its prosperity.
12.12.29	If the animals belong to other deities,
12.12.30	if the sacrificial cakes belong to other deities.
12.12.31	This is its prosperity when it is not opposed.
12.12.32	He does not attain the various powers by these.
12.12.33	Half of Prajapati's firmness
12.12.34	and half of his malice.
12.12.35	Whatever courage there was, he removed from the front.
12.12.36	Soma indeed is that.
12.12.37	Then he created the Brahman.
12.12.38	Therefore, all Brahmins are wise and authoritative.
12.12.39	Whatever evil there was, he threw away from the back.
12.12.40	Surā indeed is that. 
12.12.41	Then he created Kshatriya.
12.12.42	Therefore, the elder and the younger, the daughter-in-law and the father-in-law, having drunk wine, lie down together and lament.
12.12.43	Sin is indeed Malva.
12.12.44	Therefore, a brahmin does not drink wine.
12.12.45	So as not to mix with sin.
12.12.46	This should be said by a brahmin to a kshatriya.
12.12.47	He who knows this, and drinks Soma, is not harmed by the Soma.
12.12.48	This is the body of Prajapati.
12.12.49	Prajapati is power.
12.12.50	He places power in him.
12.13.1	Suryabanhu, the demon, covered the sun with darkness.

12.13.9	The gods offered her to Aditi for her desire.
12.13.10	With her, they made the hair grow on her.
12.13.11	Then indeed this (cow) took the hair.
12.13.12	One should offer her thus to the desire of the sun.
12.13.13	One obtains whatever desire one desires.
12.13.14	From the sun's rays, the ray stood on the north side of the sacrificial post.
12.13.15	That became a pair.
12.13.16	She became a she-goat.
12.13.17	Or rather, at that time these plants were fruitless.
12.13.18	The gods offered them to the Adityas and the Kamadevas.
12.13.19	By that they obtained the fruit.
12.13.20	Then these (plants) took the fruit.
12.13.21	One should offer them thus.
12.13.22	To Aditi and to another Kama, to the Adityan and to another Kama.
12.13.23	He offers with both kinds of oblations to Kama.

13.1.52	Twelve milch cows are the Dakṣiṇā, a golden pot is the Tarpaṇa, and a pot is the Adhivāsa.
13.1.53	These are the Sāmidhenī verses of Prajāpati.
13.1.54	These are his Aprayas.
13.1.55	The offering is made with the verse beginning with "Hiranyagarbha."
13.1.56	The Yajya and Anuvākyā verses of this Sukta.
13.1.57	By this (rite) indeed did Upkeṭu prosper.
13.1.58	He who performs this sacrifice prospers.
13.1.59	He indeed distributed the portions of the sacrificial food into twelve parts.
13.1.60	There he gave twelve cows each.
13.1.61	When he gives twelve,
13.1.62	that itself is his form.
13.1.63	The gold which is used for the Tarpya rite is kept hidden.
13.1.64	By that he obtains the unlimited.
13.2.1	One who is afflicted with disease or one who is not afflicted with disease should offer a black animal with one horn to Varuna.
13.2.2	Prajapati created beings.
13.2.3	They transgressed against him.
13.2.4	He caught them with Varuna.
13.2.5	They became weak and helpless, caught by Varuna.
13.2.6	The black animal went to them.
13.2.7	He seized its foot when it was about to escape.
13.2.8	He was released.
13.2.9	He became one-footed.
13.2.10	Those were the offspring of Prajapati.
13.2.11	He saw
13.2.12	"He who is seized by Varuna, with him I shall release them from Varuna."
13.2.13	He offered the Varuna animal.
13.2.14	With that he released them from Varuna.
13.2.15	He who is afflicted by disease is seized by Varunya.
13.2.16	Because it is Varunya.
13.2.17	He is released from Varuna.
13.2.18	One should offer a sacrifice on an island.
13.2.19	Varuna is indeed the waters.
13.2.20	He releases him from Varuna in front of him.
13.2.21	Prajapati, having created the animals, bestowed Varuna as a boon.
13.2.22	He chose this (boon).
13.2.23	Therefore, it is dedicated to Varuna.
13.2.24	He who is afflicted with disease is seized by sin.
13.2.25	Like Krishna, like sin.
13.2.26	What is Krishna?
13.2.27	He removes sin.
13.2.28	Because of the single stroke of the stick,
13.2.29	He is released from the noose of Varuna.
13.2.30	One who desires prosperity should offer a black sheep to Agni and a black goat to Varuna.
13.2.31	The Agni-offering is for prosperity.
13.2.32	He who is caught by Varuna, who is capable of prosperity but does not attain it,
13.2.33-39	What is the Varuna (rite)? He is released from Varuna himself. Half of man is Agniya, half is Varuna. The bones are Agniya, the flesh is Varuna. He redeems him with his own share. Having become debt-free, he becomes (again).
13.2.40	One should offer a black sheep to Varuna for the purpose of subjugating a Vrishni.
13.2.41	Varuna is death.
13.2.42	He subjugates him through death.
13.2.43	This is the form of sin.
13.2.44	Sin is like black.
13.2.45	Because it is black.
13.2.46	He sprinkles him with sin.
13.2.47	I bind the animal to King Varuna, the bull to Indra. Only the body parts of the animal are shared by the gods. Yama takes the enemies of the sacrificer.
13.2.48	These are the deities that rule over man.
13.2.49	One should redeem him from them.
13.2.50	Death is Yama.
13.2.51	He makes him fall into the hands of Death.
13.3.1-7	One who has an enemy should offer the Vaisnava Vamana sacrifice. Vishnu conquered these worlds. He drove out the Asuras from these worlds. One conquers these worlds. (One) drives out the enemy from these worlds. One should offer the Visama sacrifice. These worlds are uneven.
13.3.8	One who is going to perform a sacrifice should offer a horse with Indra and Maruts as the deities, with the Pṛṣṇi as the thigh, if one is going to perform an animal sacrifice for a Kṣatriya.
13.3.9	Indra is the Kṣatriyas, the Maruts are the Viśs.
13.3.10	He makes the Viśs follow the Kṣatriya
13.3.11	It becomes with the Pṛśni as the thigh.
13.3.12	He places the Viśs behind him.
13.3.13	For non-intermixture.
13.3.14	One who desires cattle should offer a horse to Indra with the Utpṛṣṭi as the deity.
13.3.15	Indra indeed turned away the strength.
13.3.16	He praised it with a thousand (verses).
13.3.17	It came forth in front of it.
13.3.18	It came forth, looking at these worlds, while it was still coming forth.
13.3.19	Therefore it is called 'Samīṣita' (the one who has come forth) and 'Pratiṣita' (one who has been turned back), because its neck was turned back.
13.3.20	One should offer this one in front of the thousand.
13.3.21	One obtains a thousand animals.
13.3.22	He (the sacrificer) indeed obtains the strength.
13.3.23	When one obtains a thousand cattle, then one should offer a Vamana to Vishnu.
13.3.24	For stability.
13.3.25	In this (world) indeed that thousand was established.
13.3.26	He (Vishnu) became established.
13.3.27	Therefore he is inclined sideways.
13.3.28	One should offer these (animals) around.
13.3.29	For the possession of a thousand.
13.3.30-38	Yajna desired Dakshina. She became pregnant. She gave birth to him and fled. Aditi saw him lying down, having been expelled. She brought him back. She placed him under her thigh. He grew under her thigh. Therefore he is bent like this.
13.3.39	Below the thighs it grew.
13.3.40	Vishnu knew him.
13.3.41	He spoke to him.
13.3.42	They asked him a question, and he replied to Vishnu.
13.3.43	Therefore they say:
13.3.44	"He is the son of the creator himself."
13.3.45	If one desires to be short, one should offer a cake to Aditi before the meal.
13.3.46	Aditi made him grow.
13.3.47	He buys it back from her.
13.3.48	With that debt-free, bought back, purified, and prosperous animal, he prospers.
13.3.49	One who aspires to sovereignty should offer a tawny bull, the first-born of Kusinara.
13.3.50	Soma is the king of the gods.
13.3.51	Soma is his deity, for one who aspires to kingship.
13.3.52	He approaches his own deity with a share in the sacrifice.
13.3.53	He dedicates it to the kingdom.
13.3.54	That is the first-born of Kusinara.
13.3.55	That is its form.
13.3.56	One should offer a red bull, the first-born from Kusinara, to Indra, the wielder of the thunderbolt, if one is engaged in warfare or desires to prosper.
13.3.57	The king is of Indra as the deity.
13.3.58	The thunderbolt is his valour.
13.3.59	He places the thunderbolt in him.
13.3.60	By that he conquers.
13.3.61	It is so.
13.3.62	What is the first Kusiṃdha?
13.3.63	That is the form of Vīrya.
13.3.64	If one is born in the first month, one should abandon it.
13.3.65	If two are born, one should abandon both.
13.3.66	If a second is born in the year, one should abandon that in the year.
13.3.67	One should offer an Agniya cake on eight potsherds for the born ones.
13.3.68	The animals belong to Agni.
13.3.69	Therefore, he buys them back from him.
13.3.70	One should offer a cake on twelve potsherds to Agni Vaiśvānara when the year is completed.
13.3.71	The year is Agni Vaiśvānaras.
13.3.72	He buys them back from the year itself, for the purpose of becoming worthy.
13.3.73	Every year one should offer a cake on twelve potsherds to Agni Vaiśvānara.
13.3.74	Agni Vaiśvānāra is the year.
13.3.75	One thus redeems oneself from the year.
13.3.76	Through these two, redeemed from all, auspicious, and blessed, one prospers.
13.3.77	Indra was born in this (month).
13.3.78	He is the most vigorous among the gods.
13.3.79	Therefore, the one born among the animals on the Ekastaka day becomes vigorous.
13.3.80	One who knows this and offers these sacrifices becomes vigorous.
13.3.81	He should offer the first sacrifice to Indra, the slayer of enemies.
13.3.82	Sin is the enemy.
13.3.83	He indeed removes sin.
13.3.84	He should make the second offering to Indra, the killer of Vritra.
13.3.85	The one who is called Papman is the one who is called Abhimatī.
13.3.86	One overcomes the one called Papman. Then one becomes victorious over Vṛtra.
13.3.87	One attains sovereignty.
13.3.88	No one else among equals is more powerful than him who, knowing this, offers these two sacrifices.
13.3.89	The other one's fee is a hundred.
13.3.90	The other's horse is the first.
13.3.91	These two are the Brahmanas.
13.3.92	If they are not thus released, he should offer them.
13.3.93	He prospers by means of them.
13.3.94	Whatever he gives there is the Dakṣiṇā.
13.4.1	One should offer a bull with a flowing mane to Indra, the angry one, in battle.
13.4.2	One makes valour by means of anger.
13.4.3	One conquers by means of power.
13.4.4	One establishes anger and power for victory.
13.4.5	The one who is the crest-jewel.
13.4.6	For prosperity in front of Manes.
13.4.7	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a contest.
13.4.8	They did not win.
13.4.9	They said:
13.4.10	"May we win through Brahma."
13.4.11	They released two bulls.
13.4.12	The white one was the leader of the gods,
13.4.13	The son of Shyain was Shyet, the son of Shyet was Ayashring, the son of Ayashring was Asura.
13.4.14	They fought together.
13.4.15	Shyetreyin defeated him.
13.4.16	The speech which was defeated fell down as a cow.
13.4.17	He who performed the sacrifice became the upper one.
13.4.18	Therefore, he who has cow-like speech is not a performer of sacrifices.
13.4.19	For that is the color of Asura.
13.4.20	Therefore, he who has the speech above him is the one who is fit for the priestly office.
13.4.21	For he is like a god.
13.4.22	One should offer a black sheep with a white tuft to Brihaspati when attacking.
13.4.23	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman.
13.4.24	He makes him advance with Brahman itself.
13.4.25	The gods indeed conquered the Asuras with this.
13.4.26	That it is a sheep with a white
13.4.27	tuft is for conquering.
13.4.28	Indra indeed slew Vritra.
13.4.29	He slew him with seven strokes.
13.4.30	From his head the Vaidehas (people of Videha) went forth.
13.4.31	They went eastwards.
13.4.32	He thought that the Vaidehas were following the bull which was the last to go forth.
13.4.33	"Now I shall sacrifice to him, by him I shall be freed from here."
13.4.34	He sacrificed to him.
13.4.35	He was not released.
13.4.36	He offered a goat to Agni and a bull to Indra.
13.4.37	By means of that (goat) he burned the sins and the enjoyments of Agni, and by means of the bull he placed the power of Indra in himself.
13.4.38	Then he became
13.4.39	One who desires to prosper should offer a goat to Agni, and a bull to Inda, if he thinks he is afflicted by sin.
13.4.40	Papman, indeed, destroyed him with seven kinds of suffering.
13.4.41	He who is capable of prosperity but does not attain it, is destroyed by Papman with these kinds of suffering. The Agni-kindled fire is the first kindling.
13.4.42	The Agni-kindled one is the first kindler.
13.4.43	By Agni alone, he burns away the sufferings of Papman and then by the Indra-kindled one, he attains strength and power in himself.
13.4.44	He becomes prosperous.
13.4.45	The gods and the Asuras were in this world.
13.4.46	The Asuras, following the gods, went away from this world.
13.4.47	Then the gods sought refuge in Prajapati.
13.4.48	He created for them Rishbha, Vasha, Yama and Yamya.
13.4.49	Therefore, when Yama and Yamya are born as a pair,
13.4.50	Rishbha is the male and
13.4.51	Vasha the female.
13.4.52	He offered the cow to Vishnu and Varuna, and the bull to Indra.
13.4.53	By means of that (sacrifice) he, having bound those Asuras by Varuna, released them by means of the sacrifice to Vishnu.
13.4.54	By means (of the sacrifice) to Indra, he placed strength and energy in himself.
13.4.55	Then the gods became (victorious),
13.4.56	and the Asuras were defeated.
13.4.57	One who is engaged in a dispute with his enemy should offer these animals: a black goat to Agni, a black sheep to Yama, a black goat to Varuna, a black bull to Indra.
13.4.58	Having bound his enemy with Varuna, he drives him away with the sacrifice of Vishnu.
13.4.59	Then with the one to Indra, he takes to himself the power and strength of Indra.
13.4.60	He becomes equal to himself.
13.4.61	His enemy becomes inferior.
13.4.62	One desiring offspring should offer the Oṣadhis to the gods.
13.4.63	This is the beloved of the plants.
13.4.64	They (the plants) surround her from the Sūta.
13.4.65	Therefore she is the beloved of all animals. The plants are water. They dig (for water).
13.4.66	He approaches them with the same share.
13.4.67	They dig for him offspring.
13.4.68	Those who follow that desire are the Dakṣiṇās.
13.4.69	For prosperity.
13.4.70	One should offer a black-colored goat to Indra for one who desires to be a king.
13.4.71	Indra was born from this (goat).
13.4.72	He looked back again.
13.4.73	He thought,
13.4.74	"Whoever is born after this, he will be my enemy."
13.4.75	Having determined the womb, he deposited it.
13.4.76	Therefore she does not give birth to another.
13.4.77	The king is the deity of the Iindra.
13.4.78	From its own womb, he generates it.
13.4.79	For prosperity.
13.4.80	One indeed becomes prosperous.
13.4.81	If one is born from her, one should offer the Iindra animal to Indra for the sake of strength.
13.4.82	This is the strength that is born from her.
13.4.83	He himself obtains that very thing and secures it.
13.4.84	One who desires should offer a sacrifice to Brahmaṇaspati after standing up,
13.4.85	"One who desires should say, "May I stand up."
13.4.86	Brahmāṇaspati is the tongue of Agni.
13.4.87	He stands up over everything.
13.4.88	He prospers him by means of form.
13.4.89	He makes him stand up.
13.5.1	One should offer a goat to Agni, a bull to Soma, if one's father and grandfather are virtuous, but one does not obtain it.
13.5.2	Agni is all the deities.
13.5.3	One offers to the deities from the mouth itself.
13.5.4	One is deprived of the Soma drink by the power of one's father or grandfather, if they are virtuous, but does not obtain it.
13.5.5	The Soma-drinking one is the deity of the Brahmana.
13.5.6	The Soma-drinking one belongs to Indra, because he is the deity of Indra.
13.5.7	He makes him prosper with the Soma-drinking one, with Indra.
13.5.8	One should offer a cow belonging to the heaven and earth, which is enclosed, to the one who is enclosed in heaven.
13.5.9	He who is enclosed in the heaven is enclosed in the sky and earth.
13.5.10	What is the heaven and earth?
13.5.11	He indeed shares him with heaven and earth.
13.5.12	He who is bound is indeed bound by the heaven.
13.5.13	His deity is the heaven.
13.5.14	What is heaven?
13.5.15	His own cattle is indeed that.
13.5.16	Of this very one.
13.5.17	One should offer a calf belonging to Vayu.
13.5.18	Vayu is the calf of these two.
13.5.19	He makes these (cows) flourish.
13.5.20	He gives them away.
13.5.21	He approaches him with the same share.
13.5.22	He makes these (cows), his own.
13.5.23	One for whom his father or grandfather has not drunk Soma, and who is thirsty, should offer this animal to Indra and Agni.
13.5.24	He who is deprived of the Soma-drink, the drink of the strong, by his father or grandfather,
13.5.25	The Agniya Brahman is the deity.
13.5.26	His Indra-Agni is the Soma-drink.
13.5.27	He continues the Soma-drink with his own deity.
13.5.28	The Soma-drink is bestowed on him whose father and grandfather have drunk Soma.
13.5.29	Because it is bestowed.
13.5.30	His own cattle are bestowed on him.
13.5.31	Because these two are
13.5.32	the form of the two-deity.
13.5.33	One who desires should offer a goat to Tvashtra.
13.5.34	"One who desires should offer an animal to Tvashtra, saying, "May my son be well-nourished."
13.5.35	Tvashtra is the creator of forms.
13.5.36	He approaches him with his share.
13.5.37	He creates forms for him.
13.5.38	One who has an enemy should offer a black-tailed horse to the Ashvins.
13.5.39	The gods drove the Asuras away in the day.
13.5.40	Whatever was their own, whatever was their wealth, whatever was their knowledge, with that they came together at night.
13.5.41	Those gods saw this black-maned horse of the Ashvins.
13.5.42	They offered it.
13.5.43	With that they followed them at night.
13.5.44	The sky and earth are the Ashvins.
13.5.45	Having thus restrained them on this side by means of Heaven and Earth, and on the other side by means of the Sun and Night, they drove them away.
13.5.46	Whatever was their own, whatever was their wealth, whatever was their knowledge, that they took away.
13.5.47	Then the gods became (gods),
13.5.48	the Asuras became (Asuras).
13.5.49	Heaven and Earth are the two Asvins.
13.5.50	Having thus driven away the enemy from the near side by means of heaven and earth, he drives him away from the far side by means of the sun, from the day and night.
13.5.51	He takes away what is his own, what is his wealth, what is his knowledge.
13.5.52	He becomes his own self.
13.5.53	His enemy becomes his own.
13.5.54	What is the crest-jewel?
13.5.55	That is the form of the day.
13.5.56	What is black?
13.5.57	That is of the night.
13.5.58	He drives him away from both castes.
13.5.59	Indra, being desirous of the Dānava woman,
13.5.60	wandered among the Asuras.
13.5.61	He became a woman among women,
13.5.62	a man among men.
13.5.63	He thought, "I am seized by Nirriti."
13.5.64	He saw this Indra-Nirriti-Vi-pum-sakam (the Indra-Nirriti Vi-pum-sakah).
13.5.65	With that form he approached.
13.5.66	With that form which was not to be given away, he approached the east.
13.5.67	Having gone to the south, enjoying his own created (land), Nirriti may take it, svāhā!
13.5.68	Then having returned again, he established the Indra (fire) in the east.
13.5.69	He having cut off Nirriti in the east, then with the Indra (fire), he placed the power and strength in himself.
13.5.70	Then he became (the god of the wind).
13.5.71	One who desires to prosper should offer the animal sacrifice to Indra and Nairrta for one who thinks he is seized by Nirriti.
13.5.72	He should proceed with the animal sacrifice that is not to be given away.
13.5.73	Having gone to the south, he should offer it in the self-created pit, saying, "May Nirriti accept it with pleasure, svāhā."
13.5.74	Then having returned again, he should establish the animal sacrifice to the wind.
13.5.75	Having first offered to Nirriti, he then offers to Indra. He thus places in himself the power and strength of Indra.
13.5.76	It indeed becomes so.
13.5.77	One who desires victory in battle should offer a bull to Indra.
13.5.78	"He thinks, "This battle will not be won."
13.5.79	Indra is the one who brings victory in battle.
13.5.80	Indra is one who makes victorious.
13.5.81	He approaches him with his share.
13.5.82-90	He tames them. Because it is wide. That is the form of the sky. One should offer a wide bull to Indra, the destroyer of strongholds, at the junction of two peoples, if one desires: "May I reach both peoples." One reaches both peoples. They move, killing each other. Because it (the bull) is wide. He makes them go to the same place.
13.6.1	One who is afflicted by an unknown disease should offer a he-goat to Agni-Varuna.
13.6.2	The he-goat is the unknown disease, and the woman is the known disease.
13.6.3	Therefore one who is afflicted by the unknown disease should offer it.
13.6.4	Agni is all the deities.
13.6.5	Whatever is bound by the deities, that he releases with Agni.
13.6.6	Whatever is seized by Varuna, that is by Varuna.
13.6.7	Whatever is seized by the Vani.
13.6.8	That is Agni's.
13.6.9	Whatever is a woman who is chaste and disciplined.
13.6.10	That is Varuna's.
13.6.11	Therefore, it becomes Agni-Varuna.
13.6.12	One desiring cattle should offer a sheep with a shoulder-bone to Tvashtra.
13.6.13	This is a pair, namely, the shoulder-bone.
13.6.14	Tvashtra is the progenitor of the pair.
13.6.15	He approaches him with the same oblation.
13.6.16	He generates cattle from this pair.
13.6.17	One should offer a black-necked sheep to Varuna if one is afflicted by consumption.
13.6.18	Varuna afflicts one who is afflicted by consumption,
13.6.19	because it is dedicated to Varuna.
13.6.20	He is released from Varuna.
13.6.21	He is seized by sin, who is afflicted by disease.
13.6.22	Sin is like a dark-coloured (cow).
13.6.23	Because it is dark-coloured.
13.6.24	He removes sin.
13.6.25	Because it has a black throat.
13.6.26	By that he is released from Varunapasha.
13.6.27	One should offer a dark-coloured cow with a black tail to Asvin, if one wishes to drink Soma as a poor brahmana.
13.6.28	The Asvins were the only gods who did not drink Soma.
13.6.29	They later obtained the drinking of Soma.
13.6.30	The Asvins are the deities of one who drinks Soma later.
13.6.31	He approaches them with a share.
13.6.32	They lead him to the drinking of Soma (at the proper time).
13.6.33	One should offer to them when one is in distress.
13.6.34	For one who is in distress, the Brahman seeks to be a Brahman.
13.6.35-43	The one who is a bad brahmin is like smoke. Because he is like smoke. He removes the smoke-like (evil). Because he is shining. He takes the lustre from the mouth. One should offer a tawny cow to Sarasvati, if one's enemies try to suffocate him. They try to suffocate one with speech. Speech is Sarasvati. Because she is Sarasvati.
13.6.44-49	He thus responds to their speech with speech. This is a cow that does not yield milk. Therefore, a cow is called a heifer. What is a heifer? He makes their speech like a heifer. One should offer a heifer to Sarasvati for one who is accused of killing a cow.
13.6.50	The speech of one who has not killed reaches him who is being slandered.
13.6.51	Speech is Sarasvati.
13.6.52	What is Sarasvati?
13.6.53	He pacifies their speech with speech.
13.6.54	This is a cow that does not give milk.
13.6.55	Therefore, a cow is called a heifer.
13.6.56	What is a heifer?
13.6.57	He makes their speech a heifer.
13.6.58	One who has been abandoned by Savitr should offer a sacrifice to Savitr. One who, having been meritorious in the past, becomes sinful later.
13.6.59	The deity by which one becomes meritorious in the past follows him.
13.6.60	Then one becomes sinful.
13.6.61	Savitr is the progenitor of prosperity.
13.6.62	One approaches him with a share in the sacrifice.
13.6.63	He again makes one prosperous.
13.6.64	He who was formerly sinful, but later attains prosperity, is like a bull who becomes an ox.
13.6.65	Just as he attains prosperity, so does he attain prosperity for him.
13.7.1	One should offer three bulls in spring, three bulls with horns in summer, and three bulls with horns and dewlap in autumn.
13.7.2	The bulls with horns.
13.7.3-12	He indeed takes the lustre from the mouth. He who is a cowherd. He indeed takes the lustre in the middle. He who has a cowherd. He indeed takes the radiance from above. The year is completed. The year indeed is strength. One indeed attains strength. There are nine. There are indeed nine breaths.
13.7.13	He places the vital airs in himself.
13.7.14	They should be Indra's.
13.7.15	One who desires to prosper should offer them.
13.7.16	The sun is indeed Indra.
13.7.17	He became so by means of these.
13.7.18	He placed the brilliance and strength in himself by means of these (offerings).
13.7.19	One who, knowing this, offers these (offerings), indeed becomes brilliant and strong.
13.7.20	One should offer the tenth animal sacrifice, of all forms, when the year is completed.
13.7.21	For the attainment of the year.
13.7.22	Prajapati is the womb.
13.7.23	One indeed stands firm in the womb.
13.7.24	He becomes of all forms.
13.7.25	For the attainmnet of all.
13.7.26	For the securing of all.
13.7.27	There are ten (animals).
13.7.28	There are ten vital airs.
13.7.29	Vital airs are power.
13.7.30	One indeed becomes firm in power.
13.7.31	One desiring food should offer the two cows, heaven and earth, as the common mothers.
13.7.32	Heaven and earth are the lords of food.
13.7.33	From them it rains.
13.7.34	It stands in this (earth).
13.7.35	These are the givers of food.
13.7.36	He approaches them with the offering.
13.7.37	They give him food.
13.7.38	They become common mothers.
13.7.39	For these are like common mothers.
13.7.40-47	One should offer the calf of these two to Vayu on the next day. Vayu is the calf of these (cows). He nourishes these (cows). He gives them (nourishment). He approaches him with his own share. He gives these (cows) to him. One desiring Brahmic glory should offer a calf with a black back to Brhaspati. Brhaspati is Brahman.
13.7.48-54	Brihaspati is the bestower of brahmic glory. He approaches him with the same share. He bestows brahmic glory on him. One who becomes (a king) is like the back. One who has a black-backed (horse) is like the front. He makes him like the back. One who is younger should offer a horse with a black tail.
13.7.55	The Asvins are the two youngest gods.
13.7.56	They went around first.
13.7.57	The Asvins are the deities of one who is the youngest.
13.7.58	He approaches them.
13.7.59	They lead him around first.
13.7.60	One who is the youngest is seized by sin.
13.7.61	Sin is like black.
13.7.62	Because he is black.
13.7.63	He removes sin.
13.7.64	Because he has a mane.
13.7.65	He indeed bestows radiance on the face itself.
13.7.66	One afflicted with disease should offer the black-tailed horse to the Ashvins.
13.7.67	The Ashvins are the physicians of the gods.
13.7.68	The Ashvin deities are for one afflicted with disease.
13.7.69	He approaches them with his share.
13.7.70	They heal him.
13.7.71	One afflicted by disease is seized by sin.
13.7.72	Sin is like black.
13.7.73	Because it is black.
13.7.74	He removes evil.
13.7.75	The shining one.
13.7.76	He bestows radiance on the face.
13.7.77	One desiring offspring or cattle should offer a tawny bull.
13.7.78	Prajapati, desiring to create offspring,
13.7.79	did not find a second mate.
13.7.80	Having assumed this form, he united with himself through the thumb.
13.7.81	From that he created offspring.
13.7.82	Tvaṣṭṛ is the begetter of the pair.
13.7.83	He approaches him with the oblation.
13.7.84	He begets cattle from this pair.
13.7.85	It is by this form that Prajapati created the creatures.
13.7.86	By the very form by which Prajapati created creatures, one is born with offspring and cattle from that very form.
13.7.87	One who is afraid of being called a eunuch should offer a bull to Indra.
13.7.88	Indra removed this skin and this sin.
13.7.89	He approaches him with his share.
13.7.90	He removes this skin and this evil from him.
13.7.91	A bull is the fee.
13.7.92	A bull means virility.
13.7.93	He places virility in him.
13.8.1	The metres approached the sacrifice.
13.8.2	The Vasat-call, having approached, cut off the head of the Gāyatrī.
13.8.3	From that what flowed out became the Vasa.
13.8.4	What flowed out of the Vasa, that is the reason why the Vasa is called Vasa.
13.8.5	That which flowed out first, it was indeed blood that flowed out.
13.8.6	That Brihaspati took up.
13.8.7-14	That which became Rohini, that became the Rohini. Therefore, that is the one belonging to Brihaspati. What flowed as the second, Mitra and Varuna took that. That which became of two forms, that became the one belonging to Mitra and Varuna. What flowed third, the All-gods took that. What became of many forms, that became. Therefore, it is the one belonging the All-gods.
13.8.15	Whatever he shook, that Brihaspati took.
13.8.16	It became a bull.
13.8.17	That is the reason for the name "bull".
13.8.18	Whatever he let go, those are the other forms.
13.8.19	One who desires brahmic glory should offer a bull to Brihaspati.
13.8.20	One who is not as bright as he should be, even though he is capable of brahmic glory, is deficient in taste.
13.8.21-28	This is the essence of the Vedas. Brahma is Brihaspati. He places the essence of brilliance in this (sacrifice) with Brahma alone. One becomes brilliant. One desiring rain should offer a two-formed animal to Mitra and Varuna. Mitra and Varuna are indeed day and night. Parjanya rains according to day and night. It rains either at night or during the day.
13.8.29	These two are the lords of the year.
13.8.30	He approaches them with the same oblation.
13.8.31	They, being pleased with him, bestow rain on him.
13.8.32	One desiring offspring should offer a two-formed oblation to Mitra-Varuna.
13.8.33	Day and night are Mitra-Varuna; offspring are born in day and night.
13.8.34	For they are born at night or during the day.
13.8.35	He causes them to be born in day and in night.
13.8.36	One who desires should offer a heifer to the All-gods, of many forms.
13.8.37	The All-gods are the desires.
13.8.38	He approaches them with a share in the sacrifice.
13.8.39	They grant him all his desires.
13.8.40	One who desires prosperity should offer a bull to Brhaspati.
13.8.41	One who is not prosperous, though he is capable of prosperity, is deprived of the sap.
13.8.42	This is the essence of the Vedas, Brahma, Brihaspati.
13.8.43	He places the essence, prosperity, in it with Brahma alone.
13.8.44	It becomes so.
13.8.45	One desiring light should offer a white horse to Surya.
13.8.46	The sun indeed is the giver of light.
13.8.47	He approaches him with his own share.
13.8.48	He bestows light on him.
13.8.49	One who is practising sorcery should offer a tawny (cow) to Brahmaspati.
13.8.50	Brahmaspati is Brahman itself.
13.8.51	He makes him advance with Brahman itself.
13.8.52	This is the form of Brahman, namely, the tawny (cow).
13.8.53	He makes him enter into the form.
13.10.1	When there is a calamity, one should know.
13.10.2	One should know.
13.10.3	May Dhatri, Rati, Savitar accept this.
13.10.4	He should offer with the ladle into the fire.
13.10.5	He offers them to the deities.
13.10.6	He says, "Turn back, turn back."
13.10.7	He turns Indra back from the directions.
13.10.8	For atonement.
13.10.9	He says (to the sacrificer), "I break your power."
13.10.10	He generates him.
13.10.11	They strike between the thighs.
13.10.12	For procreation.
13.10.13	He says "For many a day."
13.10.14	He places the vessel.
13.10.15	for Askanna.
13.10.16	One-footed, two-footed, thus it is said.
13.10.17	It is indeed spread.
13.10.18	If one were to cut off the parts of the animal that are not to be cut off.
13.10.19	If one does not cut off the parts that are to be cut off, one would incur misfortune.
13.10.20	One should cut off the parts in front of the navel.
13.10.21	One should not cut off the other parts behind the navel.
13.10.22	The breath is in front of the belly.
13.10.23	The out-breath is behind.
13.10.24	This is the extent of the animal.
13.10.25	He cuts out as much as the animal is.
13.10.26	With a knife.
13.10.27	What juice he carries in the cutting-out (of the animal),
13.10.28	by that all the limbs are cut out.
13.10.29	The fee is eight-footed gold.
13.10.30	This (animal) is eight-footed,
13.10.31	the self is the ninth.
13.10.32	This is eight-footed.
13.10.33	The rim is the ninth.
13.10.34	for the attainment of the animal.
13.10.35	In the third (layer) the inner sheath is covered with a turban.
13.10.36	One should make the sheaths like a hole.
13.10.37	For the animal has hair, skin, flesh, bones, and marrow.
13.10.38	One attains the animal itself.
13.10.39	He offers to Vishnu, the destroyer of the Shibi.
13.10.40-46	Whatever is the excess of cattle, that is Vishnu's shipivista. This is indeed the excess. The excess is shipivista. One obtains the excess by means of the excess. One indeed establishes the excess in the excess. "The embryo that is yours for sacrifice." He makes it fit for sacrifice.
13.10.47	"The womb is yours, O golden one."
13.10.48	He makes him golden.
13.10.49	"The limbs of him who is not born, the gods have joined together."
13.10.50	He joins him together.
13.10.51	"The great heaven and earth are."
13.10.52	He pours down the animal-fat.
13.10.53	This is the embryo of these two.
13.10.54	He establishes him in these two.
13.10.55	Obeisance to the greatness and to the eye of that (Agni).
13.10.56	He who does not perform these rites, moves with an unprosperous animal.
13.10.57	When he performs these rites,
13.10.58	he gathers him together in his entirety, with all his strength, with all his origin, with all his body, for prosperity.
13.12.1	These two were together.
13.12.2	They were separated by Vayu.
13.12.3	They deposited a foetus.
13.12.4	From that the goat and the sheep were born.
13.12.5-11	Agni took it first. Prajapati bought it with this sacrificial cake. If the cake is dedicated to Agni, it is for redemption. When Vayu took it, it became dedicated to Vayu. When heaven and earth deposited the embryo, it became dedicated to heaven and earth. These two were together.
13.12.12	They ran as fast as reeds.
13.12.13	That speech which was (spoken) became the female goat.
13.12.14	Therefore it is Sarasvati.
13.12.15	This sun cried out to them.
13.12.16	They deposited a foetus.
13.12.17	Then the female goat was born.
13.12.18	Therefore it belongs to Surya.
13.12.19	One who desires to shine should offer to Vayu.
13.12.20-25	The deity's abode quickly brings prosperity. One who is intent on agriculture should offer on the heaven and earth. One who intends agriculture should be established in this. Because of the heaven and earth, one is established in heaven and earth. The rain god becomes favorable to him.
13.12.26	The Kanvas and Sauśravas know this.
13.12.27	One should offer a sacrifice to Sarasvati from whom speech departs.
13.12.28	Sarasvati is speech.
13.12.29	Saraswati departs from him from whom speech departs,
13.12.30	because it is Sarasvati.
13.12.31	One regains speech.
13.12.32	The embryos of the Garas know this.
13.12.33	One desiring light should offer a sacrifice to the Sun.
13.12.34	The sun is indeed the bestower of light.
13.12.35	He bestows light on him.
13.12.36	The learned know this.
13.12.37	One desiring to be a royal priest should offer a sacrifice at the junction of Agni and Indra.
13.12.38	The Brahman is indeed connected with Agni, the Kshatriya with Indra.
13.12.39	He unites Brahman and Kshatra.
13.12.40	The Kapeyas know this.
13.12.41	One desiring food should offer the Agni-Soma sacrifice.
13.12.42	Agni is the food-giver of the gods.
13.12.43	Soma is food.
13.12.44	One eats food through Agni.
13.12.45	One obtains it through Soma.
13.12.46	The Aruṇayas know this.
13.12.47	"Come, O Vayu, O you who are pure and have food, come to us."
13.12.48-56	He who created it, therefore he binds it to him. "For the purpose of the mind, for thee." For the purpose of mind, indeed, it is bound. "For desire, for thee." For desire, indeed, it it bound. "for prosperity, for thee." for prosperity, indeed, it if bound. "May thy mind be for Kikkitā, for Prajapati, svāhā." He makes her mind go to Prajapati.
13.12.57	"Kikkitā, your eye to the sun, svāhā."
13.12.58	He makes her eye go to the sun.
13.12.59	"Kikkitā, thy ear to heaven and earth, svāhā."
13.12.60	He makes her ear go to heaven and earth.
13.12.61	"Kikkiṭā, your speech to Sarasvatī, svāhā."
13.12.62	He makes her speech go to Sarasvatī.
13.12.63	"Kikkitā, your breath to the wind, svāhā."
13.12.64	He makes her breath go to the wind.
13.12.65	"Kikkitā, yours."
13.12.66	He offers.
13.12.67	Therefore domestic animals approach in the form of Kikkitā.
13.12.68	Wild animals are frightened away from the form of Kikkita.
13.12.69	He offers these five times.
13.12.70	Animals are fivefold.
13.12.71	As much as the animal, so much does he send to the heavenly world.
13.12.72	"Vasasi, vasini" (O Vasati, O Vasini).
13.12.73	He indeed prays for a blessing.
13.12.74	"Once, when you conceived in your mind."
13.12.75	He indeed generates.
13.12.76	"O goat, you are the most prosperous."
13.12.77	"You lie down on the earth."
13.12.78	He indeed sends him to these worlds.
13.12.79	"Stand up in the upper sky, may your bright light be in heaven, svāhā."
13.12.80	He indeed sends them to the world of heaven.
13.12.81	"Follow the thread stretched out, the shining one, from the dust."
13.12.82	He indeed prays for a blessing.
13.12.83	"Protect the path of the luminous one, created by the mind."
13.12.84	For the destruction of the Rakshasas.
13.12.85	"In the prime of life, in the prime of youth, may we be without decay."
13.12.86	He makes it firm.
13.12.87	"He says, "O Manu, generate the divine people."
13.12.88	He generates them.
13.12.89	"You are the oblation of Tapas, the colour of Prajapati."
13.12.90	"May I be a part of your body."
13.12.91	He prays for a blessing.
13.12.92	When he sows in water,
13.12.93	that is failure.
13.12.94	When he offers in fire,
13.12.95	that is success.
13.12.96	What the clouds offer to him,
13.12.97	that is not proper.
13.12.98	Then it is not born at all.
13.12.99	This is indeed the prosperity of Vīdhra.
13.12.100	One should offer with this to Vīdhra alone.
13.12.101	This is the prosperity of three, namely, the one who performs the annual Soma sacrifice, the householder and the one who performs a thousand sacrifices.
13.12.102	They should offer with this.
13.12.103	"May Surya, the dispenser of heaven to those who dwell in heaven, the dispenser of the kingdom to the people, Vayu, the dispenser of progeny, Brihaspati offer thee to Prajapati, the luminous, with the luminous oblation, svāhā."
13.12.104	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman.
13.12.105	By means of Brahman he offers her to Prajapati the luminous, with a luminous oblation.
13.13.1	Agni, when born, did not shine.
13.13.2	He desired,
13.13.3	"May I be lustrous."
13.13.4	He offered a black-necked goat to Agni the lustrous.
13.13.5	Then indeed he became lustrous.
13.13.6	He desired,
13.13.7	"Everywhere may I be able."
13.13.8	He offered to Agni the all-pervading a black-necked kid.
13.13.9	Then indeed everywhere he became able.
13.13.10	He desired,
13.13.11	"May I be a sharer in everything."
13.13.12	He offered to Agni Bhaga a black-necked goat.
13.13.13	Then indeed he became a sharer in all things.
13.13.14	He who desires:
13.13.15	"May I be lustrous,
13.13.16	may I be a sharerer in all things,
13.13.17	may I become a sharer in every thing."
13.13.18	He should offer these black-necked goats to Agni.
13.13.19	He becomes bright.
13.13.20	He is able everywhere.
13.13.21	He has a share everywhere.
14.5.1	The gods saw different sacrifices.
14.5.2	This one is mine.
14.5.3	This one belongs to you.
14.5.4	Then they all saw this one.
14.5.5	They were attached to it.
14.5.6	They fought for it.
14.5.7	Brihaspati won it.
14.5.8-16	Brihaspati was the priest of the gods. Whatever the priest hears, he tells the king. He performed a sacrifice for Indra. He attained self-sovereignty. This sacrifice is self-sovereignty itself. One who performs this sacrifice attains self-sovereignty.
14.5.17	Therefore, the king.
14.5.18	The gods indeed brought different sacrifices.
14.5.19	Then Prajapati brought this one.
14.5.20	The gods desired to be the priests in it.
14.5.21	He gave them the Ujjiti hymns.
14.5.22	Then Prajapaty performed this sacrifice.
14.5.23	He attained self-sovereignty.
14.5.24	This is the sacrifice of self-sovereignty.
14.5.25	He who performs this sacrifice goes to his own kingdom.
14.5.26	Food is indeed the strength.
14.5.27	He who knowing this eats food, indeed goes to strength.
14.5.28	Soma is the Vājapeya.
14.5.29	He who knows this and drinks Soma, indeed goes to the strength.
14.5.30	As many gods as drank Soma, they went to strength.
14.5.31	Therefore, everyone desires Soma.
14.5.32-38	Speech is the source of strength. That speech, created, became fourfold. In these worlds, three quarters. In animals, the fourth. What is in heaven, that is in Brihatī, that is in thunder. What is on earth, that is in Agni, that is in Rathantara.
14.5.39	Whatever was left over from the animals, they placed in the Brahmana.
14.5.40	Therefore, the Brahmana speaks both kinds of speech, divine and human.
14.5.41	He who knows this performs the deed with speech.
14.5.42	He comes to the sacrifice with the speech of the Brihat and Rathantara.
14.5.43	With the speech of the animals, he performs the sacrifice.
14.5.44	He who knows this goes to the world of the unperishing.
14.5.45	He knows as much as speech.
14.5.46	For it is by speech that one gives.
14.5.47	It is by speech that it is given.
14.5.48	One who sings with the Gāthā and Nārāśaṃsa verses does not deserve to receive anything.
14.5.49	For he sings with falsehood.
14.5.50	For the Gāthās and Nārāsaṃsa verses are false.
14.5.51	One who is drunk does not deserve to be received.
14.5.52	For he is false when drunk.
14.5.53	When he is not drunk, then he is free from that.
14.6.1	These are the seventeen pairs of Prajapati's Grahas.
14.6.2	The man is seventeenfold, belonging to Prajapati.
14.6.3	The four limbs are the head, neck, self, speech, the seventh, and the ten vital airs.
14.6.4	Sin is attached to each limb of the man.
14.6.5	When he seizes the Grahas in succession.
14.6.6	He releases him from sin, from limb to limb.
14.6.7	Soma is prosperity.
14.6.8	Suropayamas are sin.
14.6.9	When at the proper time they rush forward with the Somas and backward with the Suropamas,
14.6.10	He purifies him from sin.
14.6.11	Therefore they say,
14.6.12	One who has performed the Vājapeya sacrifice is indeed pure.
14.6.13	For sin indeed afflicts him.
14.6.14	These five Grahas are taken.
14.6.15	The sacrifice is fivefold.
14.6.16	He indeed wins the sacrifice.
14.6.17	All of them are connected with Indra.
14.6.18	He indeed places his power in one place.
14.6.19	Soma indeed is the supreme food of the gods.
14.6.20	This is the supreme food of men, namely, Sura.
14.6.21	When Soma and Sura are taken together,
14.6.22	he obtains the inferior food by means of the superior food.
14.6.23	Soma is indeed the brilliance of Brahman.
14.6.24	Sura is the blemish of food.
14.6.25	When Soma is taken together with Sura,
14.6.26-33	He takes on himself the brilliance of the Brahman. He removes the impurity of food with the impurity of Soma. He conquers the world of gods with the Soma-grahas. He conqueres the world of men with the Sura-grahas. He unites himself with the Soma- grahas. He unites his wife with the Sura- grahas. Therefore it is said: "One who performs the Vajapeya sacrifice is born in the other world."
14.6.34	For by sacrifice he conquers it.
14.6.35	"O god Savitar, do thou cause the sacrifice to prosper, do thou cause Yajnapati to prosper for Bhaga."
14.6.36	He offers on the Parusha-grass with the Savitri-verse.
14.6.37	This is a sacrifice that has been interrupted.
14.6.38	Who knows how much of this is known, and how much is not known?
14.6.39	For the sake of all.
14.6.40	For prosperity.
14.6.41	"The mother earth at the impulse of Vaja."

14.6.51	Then indeed he makes them fit for sacrifice, fit for the sacrifice.
14.6.52	"He yokes (them) with, 'Vayu is thee, Manu is thee.'
14.6.53	He yokes (the horses).
14.6.54	For indeed a man is not fit to yoke them.
14.6.55	He yokes them with the deities.
14.6.56	'From the foot of the waters, from the swift-moving,'
14.6.57	He cleanses the wheels.
14.6.58	He speaks after the sun has risen.
14.7.1-8	It is seventeenfold. Prajapati is seventeenfold. He attains Prajapati. They make the Dundubhi drums resound. This is the speech that entered the forest. He conquers it. "At the impulse of the god Savitar, at the impulse of truth." He mounts the thunderbolt impelled by Savitar.
14.7.9	We are in the impulse of the divine Savitr, of the true pressing.
14.7.10	He stands on the chariot impelled by Savitr.
14.7.11	For the winning of the prize.
14.7.12	Brahma approaches.
14.7.13	Prajapati is Brahma of the sacrifice.
14.7.14	Prajapatir gave Indra wealth.
14.7.15	Prajapatih himself bestows him from the thunderbolt.
14.7.16	He sings the Sama.
14.7.17	Truth is the Sama.
14.7.18	He recites it with truth alone.
14.7.19	He recites the verses of the Vājas.
14.7.20	For the victory of the Vāja.
14.7.21	They run with chariots that have been blessed.
14.7.22	The gods went to heaven by means of the Dakṣiṇā.
14.7.23	When they run with chariots that are blessed,
14.7.24	he goes to heaven by means means of the Daksiṇā.
14.7.25	The garment is made of darbha grass.
14.7.26	For the purity.
14.7.27	He recites the Ujjiti hymns.
14.7.28	Speech is the Ujjiti.
14.7.29	He conquers speech.
14.7.30	The gods, when the plants were ripe, fought for the prize.
14.7.31	They were conquered by Brihaspati.
14.7.32	He chose the Nivarā grains.
14.7.33	That is why the Nivarā are called Nivarā.
14.7.34	Brihaspati conquered this (prize).
14.7.35	He makes him a sharer of it.
14.7.36	He places it in the Catvāla.
14.7.37	Here indeed was the sun.
14.7.38	The gods, having surrounded him with these (bricks), sent him to this world.
14.7.39	For the attainment of the heavenly world.
14.7.40	"May the impulse of the Vāja come to me,"
14.7.41	He offers when they have returned.

14.7.43	This is the true agreement that you made with Indra.
14.7.44	The trees, the lords of the forest, have praised Indra, the strong one.
14.7.45	"Release yourselves!"
14.7.46	They are yoked by means of the Yajus and released by means of the same Yajus.
14.7.47	"The strong ones, the conquerors of strength."
14.7.48	He makes them smell the yoke.
14.7.49	He makes them share in the sacrifice.
14.7.50	"The conquerors of strength, the strong ones."
14.7.51	He gives them to the gods.
14.7.52	He pleases them all.
14.8.1	Those who run in a race take half of the spoils and the best part.
14.8.2	He buys back with that very thing which they have won.
14.8.3	They take the Madhu-sthala for the Brahman.
14.8.4	He buys it back with that very Brahman.
14.8.5	The prince Kakubha eats.
14.8.6	Kakup is indeed energy.
14.8.7	The prince is energy.
14.8.8	He indeed places energy in energy.
14.8.9	"He says, "May we ascend the heaven with our wife."
14.8.10	He indeed ascends heaven in union with his wife.
14.8.11	This indeed is the wife's participation in the sacrifice.
14.8.12	He indeed puts the pair at the mouth of the sacrifice.
14.8.13	For procreation.
14.8.14	"May life be accomplished by the sacrifice."
14.8.15	This is the extent of a man.
14.8.16	Having become all, he goes to the heavenly world.
14.8.17	The vessel is made of wheat.
14.8.18	Wheat is of Prajapati.
14.8.19	It is half of the plants.
14.8.20	He goes to the heavenly realm with food.

14.8.22	To Prasava, svāhā.
14.8.23	These are thirteen oblations.
14.8.24	Thirteen months are a year.
14.8.25	The year is the world of heaven.
14.8.26	He places him in the world of heaven in the year.
14.8.27	He stands firm in it.
14.8.28	They offer with the pot of ashes.
14.8.29	The ashes are Prajapati's.
14.8.30	They offer him with food.
14.8.31	He who goes to this world from this world
14.8.32	What they offer in the pot of ashes.
14.8.33	By that he does not go from this world.
14.8.34	He descends with the goat-skin and gold.

14.8.45	For the obtaining of food.
14.8.46	With seven (verses).
14.8.47	There are seven metres.
14.8.48	He obtains food by means of the metres.
14.8.49	The metres are speech.
14.8.50	By speech alone he wins food.

14.8.52	If a Brahmin were to perform a sacrifice,
14.9.6	He attains the Agniṣṭoma by that.
14.9.7	For the Agniṣṭomah is established in Agni.
14.9.8	If it is Indra-Agni,
14.9.9	he attains the Ukthas by that.
14.9.10	The Ukthas are Indra-Agni.

14.9.24	These are the worlds of the gods.
14.9.25	He obtains as many worlds of the gods as there are.
14.9.26	Now this is the Sarasvati sheep.
14.9.27	Whatever is the seventeenfold praise that is not bound, for the binding of that.
14.9.28	Now this one is the Marutī black-spotted female goat.
14.9.29	The gods and the Asuras were in this world.
14.9.30-36	These are not the gods, these are not the Asuras. The gods saw this Marutī, the tawny one, the willing one. They offered her. With her they won the second world, the world of the Asuras. The world of the gods where they sin. The world of the Asura where they do not sin. With her he wins the second world, his enemy's world.
14.9.37	For in the second world there is an enemy.
14.9.38	Of these five, Sarasvatī is the best.
14.9.39	Of these seventeen, Sarasvatī and Sarasvatī are the best.
14.9.40	Sarasvatī is speech.
14.9.41	He makes the sacrifice continue with speech.
14.9.42	What a learned man does not do at a sacrifice, or what an ignorant man transgresses, that is a gap.

14.9.51	He stands firm in speech.
14.10.1	The Rathantara is the Sama.
14.10.2	For obtaining blessings.
14.10.3-12	This is the Rathantara. One is consecrated in this (verse). The Vajapeya is of a different kind, being of Prajapati, when it is defined. It has a defined Sama. By that it is of a different type. Because the morning Savas are undefined. By that (verse) it is of the same type. The morning Savas are undefinable. Prajapati is undefinable. He attains Prajapati.
14.10.13	At midday they praise with the Vājavatī verses.
14.10.14	Food is indeed strength.
14.10.15	For the attainment of food.

14.10.19	He thus extends the praise to the northern Uktha.
14.10.20	The Brhat Sāman is sung.
14.10.21-26	Or whatever is in excess of that, it exceeds that world. The great one deserves to attain that world. Greatness is power and strength. One indeed stands in power and strength. The Visnu-related verses are sung in the Shivivistavati (hymn). This is the most animal-like form of Prajapati, which is Shivivistavata.
14.10.27	Therefore they praise the Shivi-Vistas.
14.10.28	This is an excess.
14.10.29	The Shivi-Vitas are an excess.
14.10.30	One obtains an excess by means of an excess.

19.1.7	He turns her away from these worlds by means of the metres.
19.1.8	It is scraped on both sides.
19.1.9	One should scrape it from the other side. This food is prepared by means of a knife.

19.1.11	The sun is fire, for the securing of food and the sun.
19.1.12	One should make it the size of an arm-span.
19.1.13	The sacrifice is equal to a man.
19.1.14	Equal to the man of the sacrifice.
19.1.15	One should do it the size of a fathom.

19.1.20	This is indeed the most vigorous among the trees, for the sake of vigor.
19.1.21	One should make a tree with knots, bamboo, and holes.
19.1.22	Agni indeed departed from the gods.
19.1.23	He entered the bamboo.
19.1.24	He put on these armors, which are the shields.
19.1.25	He followed this world, which is the hole.
19.1.26	Wherever he settled, he burned it down. It became black.
19.1.27	When the reed-pipe of the black one becomes hollow, it is indeed Agni's own. For prosperity.
19.1.28	And also because whatever is deposited here is secured.
19.2.1	Agni indeed departed from the gods.
19.2.2	Wherever he went, Prajapati saw him.
19.2.3	The horse is Prajapati.
19.2.4	They go with the horse, for the sake of following Agni.
19.2.5	With this (horse) indeed the gods overcame the Asuras.
19.2.6	When they go with the horse (it is) for overcoming the enemy.
19.2.7	The horse is not overcome by the Rakshas.
19.2.8	When they proceed with the horse (they do so) for overcoming the Rakshas (and their influence).
19.2.9	They lead the horse first and the donkey afterwards.
19.2.10	For the exclusion of the sinful and the wicked.
19.2.11	Therefore the good one goes first, the sinful one follows after.
19.2.12	He carries with a donkey.
19.2.13	Therefore he is the lowest of animals carrying semen.
19.2.14	For Agni burned his semen.
19.2.15	Because by this he gathers the energy and light in her, therefore he is the most living in her.
19.2.16	"Run swiftly, O horse, drive the young ass!"
19.2.17	This is indeed for the horse and the ass.
19.2.18	"At every union, at every union, we invoke thee, at every race, at every race. We invoke thee, O Indra, with our friends."
19.2.19	For the union and the race Agni is piled up.
19.2.20	Come, O Agni, advancing, without enemies.
19.2.21	One's enemy is many.
19.2.22	One who builds the fire becomes this.
19.2.23	The horse is the thunderbolt.
19.2.24	The enemy is sin and enemies.
19.2.25	With the thunderbolt one advances against the sin and enemy.
19.2.26	Come, O Agni, to the lordship of Rudra and the Gaṇas.
19.2.27	The animals are indeed fierce.
19.2.28	Having driven away the animals from Rudra, he performs the rite for himself.
19.2.29	"He says, "Do thou carry the earth."
19.2.30	For this is now the deity of the atmosphere.
19.2.31	" "He says, "With Pūṣan, the companion, together."
19.2.32	Pūṣan indeed is the arranger of paths; for the accomplishment.
19.2.33	" "From the abode of the earth, Agni, the purifier, like the Angiras, I bring."
19.2.34	Agni is the abode of excrement.
19.2.35	The Angirasas first brought him together with the deities.
19.2.36	He brings him together with the goddesses, indeed, his own abode.
19.2.37	One should say, "May Agni be like Angiras, the abode of excreta," with whom one may be united.
19.2.38	Every man has Agni.
19.2.39	He takes his own strength.
19.2.40	Agni should be brought together with Prajapati.
19.2.41-48	Having told the king, he is indeed the darkest of Prajapati. This indeed is Prajapati.  His ear is this anthill. Having dug up the anthill and recited the mantra, he builds the fire altar, having told Prajapati. They listen to him building the fire altar. He does not build the fire altar. The ear is indeed the anthill.
19.2.49	He says to Karna:
19.3.1	"Agni has announced the foremost of the dawns." For the sake of following.
19.3.2	"Having come, O Agni, having driven away all enemies, having conquered." He indeed drives away the enemies by this.
19.3.3	"Having stepped, O Agni, upon the earth, thou hast desired Agni with thy radiance."
19.3.4	Prajapati desired him with the former (verse),
19.3.5	he found him with the latter.
19.3.6	He desires with the former (verse).
19.3.7	He obtains with the latter (verse).
19.3.8	"The sky is your back, the earth is your seat."
19.3.9	The horse is indeed the thunderbolt, belonging to Prajapati.
19.3.10	With the hairs on both sides of the mouth, he gives away animals. With the hairs on the other side of the mouth,
19.3.11	he seizes his enemy with the thunderbolt.
19.3.12	Where the sacrifice is performed in accordance with its proper form, there the animals are born in accordance with their proper form.
19.3.13	He makes him go out and come in with the Anurupas.
19.3.14	Therefore animals are born in pairs.
19.3.15	With two (verses).
19.3.16	The sacrificer has two feet; for stability.
19.3.17	If the Adhvaryu offers a oblation without fire, the Adhvaryus becomes blind.
19.3.18	The Rakshas destroy the sacrifice.
19.3.19	Agni desired Varuna's waters.
19.3.20	His brilliance fell down.
19.3.21	That became gold.
19.3.22	When one offers with gold, one offers to Agni, for prosperity.
19.3.23	The Adhvaryu does not become blind.
19.3.24	The Rakshas do not destroy the sacrifice.
19.3.25	"I long for Agni with my mind and ghee."
19.3.26	Mind is more important than speech.
19.3.27	One attains the offering through mind.
19.3.28	All the worlds are destroyed. Therefore, all beings are destroyed towards him.
19.3.29	The most excellent food, the most excellent food, is given. He makes food tasty for him.

19.3.35	At the beginning of the sacrifice, the demons seek to harm the sacrifice.
19.3.36	When he draws (the altar) around, it is for the removal of demons.
19.3.37	He writes with three (verses).
19.3.38	These are the three worlds.
19.3.39	He removes the obstacles from these worlds.
19.3.40	He writes with the Gayatri verse, "The wise Vaja-pati has surrounded us."

19.3.47	With the Tristubh, 'Thou, O Agni, with thy light',
19.3.48	The Tristubh is vigour.
19.3.49	He conquers him with vigour.
19.3.50	He writes around in the middle with the Anushtubha.
19.3.51	The Anushtubh is speech.
19.3.52	He places speech in the middle.
19.4.4	The sacrificer with two feet is established for stability.
19.4.5	He takes up the lotus leaf, saying, "You are the back of the waters, the womb of Agni."
19.4.6	For this is indeed the back of the water, the womb of the Agni.
19.4.7	He collects with a lotus leaf.
19.4.8	He collects it with its own womb, for peace, for non-injury.
19.4.9	He collects (the fire) with a black antelope skin.
19.4.10	The black antelope skin is indeed the sacrifice.
19.4.11	By means of sacrifice, he gathers the sacrifice for non-falling.
19.4.12	For the sacrifice does not fall at the sacrifice.
19.4.13	This is indeed the form of Brahman, namely the black antelope skin.
19.4.14	He gathers him with Brahman, and with the Rik and Sama.
19.4.15	You are the shelter and
19.4.16	You are the armour. Thus he spreads.
19.4.17	This is the lotus leaf.
19.4.18	That is the black antelope skin.
19.4.19	He strews them on this very (earth).
19.4.20	"They are the two, the unpierced and the abundant," because they are the two, unpierced and abundant.

19.4.22	"The Agni who is the lord of the house," because he is the lord of houses.

19.4.25	"You are the one who is full of excrement, the bearer of all." He is indeed full of excrement and the bearer of all.
19.4.26	"Atharva first churned you, O Agni." Prajapati was Atharva.
19.4.27	Prajapati first churned him.
19.4.28	Prajapati himself generates him.
19.4.29	"He is the one whom the sage Dadhyan has known."
19.4.30	Dadhyan Atharvaṇa was shining.
19.4.31	He himself collects him.
19.4.32	"The one whom Pathya, the bull, has known." He repeats what was said before.
19.4.33	He pours with four (verses).
19.4.34	There are four metres.
19.4.35	He pours it with the metres.
19.4.36	One should pour for a Brahman with Gāyatrī verses.
19.4.37	For the Brahman is Gāyatrī.
19.4.38	With Tristubh verses for a Kṣatriya.
19.4.39	For the Kṣatriya is Tristubh.

19.4.46	He places brilliance and the sense-organ in it in the right order.
19.4.47	He pours with eight (verses).
19.4.48	The Gāyatrī has eight syllables.

19.5.2	From their place of rest, the plants grew up, the excellent plants. Therefore plants bear fruit.
19.5.3	May the wind, the son of Matariśvan, bestow it on you. Therefore the wind carries rain.
19.5.4	The wind is indeed the breath.
19.5.5	He places the breath in him.
19.5.6	To that god, let there be a 'Vasat' for you.
19.5.7	The seasons are six.
19.5.8	He places the rain in the seasons.
19.5.9	Therefore it rains season by season.
19.5.10	If one were to offer the Vasat-call directly, the Vasat-calling would be exhausted.
19.5.11	If one does not offer the Vasat call, the demons would destroy the sacrifice.
19.5.12	Therefore, O god, let there be the Vasat-offering for you.
19.5.13	The Vasat-call is not wasted.
19.5.14	The Rakshas do not destroy the sacrifice.
19.5.15	If one were to offer with clarified butter, one would injure the earth with the ladle.

19.5.23	The Anushtubh is Agni's dear body.
19.5.24	He enclosses him with his dear body.

19.5.32	He establishes him in these two.
19.5.33	"Agni, the beautiful one, is borne among the plants." Therefore Agni is among all plants.
19.5.34	"He thunders above his mothers." The plants are his mothers.
19.5.35	He indeed directs him towards them.
19.5.36	"Be firm, O Vīḍvaṅga!" He makes the ass bear the burden.
19.5.37	Therefore he is the most burdened of animals.
19.5.38	"Be auspicious to the human beings, O Angiras!" Now indeed he grieves the creatures. For peace.
19.5.39	"Do not burn the heaven and earth, do not burn the atmosphere, do not burn plants." He thus appeases him from these worlds.
19.5.40	"Let the horse go, neighing." For the purpose of union.
19.5.41	"Do not burn the foot, the abode of life." He thus places life in him.
19.5.42	Therefore the donkey lives its entire life.
19.5.43	Therefore they are afraid when the donkey dies.
19.5.44	"Bearing the bull, the bull, Agni," for he is indeed a bull, and he bears the bull.
19.5.45	"The embryo of the waters, the ocean," for he is the embryo of the waters.
19.5.46	"O Agni, come with the Vitas," for the gods indeed won this (world) with Agni, for victory.
19.5.47	He who has fallen from his abode and has not yet gone to his destination, he thinks of the sacrificer and the Adhvaryu.
19.5.48	"Truth, truth." This is truth.
19.5.49	That is truth.
19.5.50	He establishes him in these two.
19.5.51	The plants receive him, Agni, coming here, peaceful. To you all, O plants, he says. The plants are his share.
19.5.52	He establishes him in them.
19.5.53	And he establishes him in those by which he is thrown down.
19.5.54	Therefore plants take fruit.
19.5.55	He takes it with two (verses),
19.5.56	because the Sacrificer has two feet, for support.
19.5.57	He lets it fall with the verse, "Thou art let loose."
19.5.58	He lets loose Varuna's noose.
19.5.59	He sprinkles water with the verse, "The waters are firm, the bountiful ones."
19.5.60	The waters are calm.
19.5.61	He appeases his impurity with the peaceful (verses).
19.5.62	With three (verses).
19.5.63	Agni is threefold.
19.5.64	He appeases the impurity of Agni, whatever its extent.
19.5.65	He mixes it with goat's hair.
19.5.66	The goat is Agni's dear body.
19.5.67	He mixes him with his own dear body.
19.5.68	With sand.
19.5.69	For firmness.
19.5.70	He mixes them with skulls of animals.
19.5.71	He causes the animals of the forest to be mixed with the ashes.
19.5.72	If he were to mix them with the animals of the village, he would cause the animals of the villages to be mixed with ashes.
19.5.73	Therefore, these are the youngest of the animals that are born.
19.5.74	For these are the animals that are mixed with ashes.
19.6.1	"The friends have united the earth." This is the Varuna-bond.
19.6.2	He approaches the Varuna-band with a friend.
19.6.3	"The Rudras have united the earth, united with the Vasus and the Rudras." It is with these deities that Prajapati created her.
19.6.4	He unites her with them.
19.6.5	He gives it to the others.
19.6.6	He recites with other (verses).
19.6.7	He makes it a pair.
19.6.8	And he obtains the blessing of the sacrifice in the middle.
19.6.9	"Thou art the head of the sacrifice," the sacrifice is the Makha.
19.6.10	He makes it the head of the sacrificer.
19.6.11	"The Vasus make thee with the Gayatri metre," it was with these deities that Prajapati made it.
19.6.12-20	He makes it with those (bricks). He makes it three-fold. These are the three worlds. He obtains these worlds. He makes it five-fold. The sacrifice is five-fold. He wins the sacrifice. "May the offspring be in me." This is a blessing. The milking of the metres is (thus) done. One should make it the size of an arm.
19.6.21	The sacrifice is equal to a man.
19.6.22	The sacrifice is equal to the man.
19.6.23	One should make it as long as one can reach with one's arms.
19.6.24	This is the strength of a man.
19.6.25	It is equal to strength.
19.6.26	One should do it the size of a span.
19.6.27	This is indeed the size of the mouth.
19.6.28	The mouth of the gods is Agni.
19.6.29	It is the equal of the mouth.
19.6.30	One should make it unlimited for the purpose of enclosing the unlimited.
19.6.31	One should make it with four breasts for the milking of Aditi.
19.6.32	One should (make it) with six breasts for the milking (of the cows) of the seasons.
19.6.33	One should do it with eight breasts for the milking by the Gāyatrī.
19.6.34	One should have two breasts for the milking the heaven and earth.
19.6.35	One should perform the one with nine corners for the purpose of cursing.
19.6.36	The thunderbolt is three-fold.
19.6.37	He strikes the thunderbolt at his brother.
19.6.38	He makes the hole with the formula, "May Aditi hold the string, may Aditi hold your hole."
19.6.39	For men make holes with formulas.
19.6.40	They turn it away with a human vessel.
19.6.41	Or if it were to break before being baked, the sacrificer would be afflicted, his sacrifice would be ruined.
19.6.42	Having made it into a big pot, he gives it to the deities.
19.6.43	"May the Vasus fumigate you with the Gayatri metre." Prajapati fumigated it with these deities.
19.6.44	With those (sticks) alone he fumigates it.
19.6.45	He fumigates with horse-dung.
19.6.46	The horse belongs to Prajapati.
19.6.47	Prajapati is the sacrifice. For the sake of having the same origin.
19.6.48	He fumigate with seven (sticks).
19.6.49	The cauldron is indeed the head of the sacrifice.
19.6.50	There are seven vital airs.
19.6.51	He places the vital airs in the head.
19.6.52	Therefore the vital airs in head are seven.
19.7.1	"The goddess Aditi, the one who is worshipped by all the gods, is this (earth). Aditi is indeed this (earth).
19.7.2	One digs out Aditi for Aditi, for her non-injury.
19.7.3	For one does not injure oneself.
19.7.4	The wives of the gods, indeed, the wives of the gods first placed her here.
19.7.5	She places her with them.
19.7.6	The goddesses, indeed, the goddesses are knowledge.
19.7.7-12	He binds her with the Veda. "He says, "O Varutris!" Varutris are the Hotr. He cooks her with the Hotr. "O Gnas!" The Gnas are the metres. He cooks it with the metres. " "O Janas!" The Janas are the wives of the gods. They cooked her first."
19.7.13-20	He cooks it with those (oats). He says, 'May the enemies cook it.' Therefore, the crops are cooked twice in a year. He cooks it with six (oats). There are six seasons. The gods cooked this (oats) for their wives with the seasons. He cooks with them. This (oats) was cooked by Varuna and Meni.
19.7.21	"And Mitra, the holder of the people," thus he approaches Varuna with Mitra.
19.7.22	"May the god Savitr sprinkle thee," thus he sprinkles with the Savitri verse for prosperity.
19.7.23	"Uninjured, thou fillest the directions on earth," therefore Agni shines in all directions.
19.7.24	"Rise up, be the great one, stand upright, be firm," thus he firmly establishes him.
19.7.25	Or if it were to break, the sacrificer would be afflicted, his sacrifice would be ruined.
19.7.26	"I give this pot to Mitra." Mitra is indeed Brahman.
19.7.27	He gives it to Brahman itself.
19.7.28	If it were to break he should join it with those potsherds and make another.
19.7.29	That itself is the atonement for the sacrifice.
19.7.30	The Vasus should sprinkle you with the Gāyatrī metre. The rite is performed with metres.
19.7.31	It is sprinkled with metres.
19.7.32	Cooked with metres.
19.7.33	They sprinkle with metres the metres with their own place.
19.7.34	The vessel is not sprinkled if it is not divine.
19.7.35	When one sprinkles, one makes it divine.
19.7.36	He offers it with the milk of a she-goat.
19.7.37	For Agni is the most excellent one, for prosperity.
19.7.38	And with the highest milk.
19.8.1	Now these animals are offered to Agni and the desires.
19.8.2	The fires are the desires.
19.8.3	He conquers all these desires.
19.8.4	He obtains all desires.
19.8.5	If he does not offer animals, his animals would be unprotected.
19.8.6	If he were to establish them, the heads would be worn out.
19.8.7	If he does not establish them, he would interrupt the sacrifice.
19.8.8	When he offers animals, he protects the animals.
19.8.9	When he releases them after having been put around the fire, it is for the heads not to be worn out.
19.8.10	With one (verse) he establishes (the animal) for the continuity of the sacrifice, for non-interruption.
19.8.11	With the Prajapati verse.
19.8.12	The sacrifice is Prajapati.
19.8.13	He establishes the sacrifice in the sacrifice.
19.8.14	He does not interrupt the sacrifice.
19.8.15	Those animals which are offered to Agni are Indra's.
19.8.16	When those which are Indra's are offered to Agni, he makes the deities equal.
19.8.17	He should perform the Agniya and Tristubh Yagya and Anuvakya.
19.8.18	The Tristubh is related to Indra.
19.8.19	By this, the Indra-related (verses) are performed.
19.8.20	He does not make the deities equal.
19.8.21	Now this is the Vayu-related white sheep.
19.8.22	This is offered after having offered all animals.
19.8.23	The horse that is the last one is offered to the animals.
19.8.24	The man with beard is offered to the man.
19.8.25	The animal with eight teats is offered to the eight-teat animals.
19.8.26	One should perform the Yajya and Anuvakya verses for the Niyutvatis for the stability and non-madness of the sacrificer.
19.8.27	If the Niyutvati verses are not performed, the sacrificer may become mad or fall.
19.8.28	Vāyumati, Shukravatī.
19.8.29	Vāyu is the brilliance of Agni.
19.8.30	Therefore, wherever the wind blows, Agni follows.
19.8.31	It follows its own brilliance.
19.8.32	Vāyus is the beloved abode of animals.
19.8.33	Prāṇa is Vāyu.
19.8.34	Animals stand near him, knowing that he is Vāyu.
19.8.35-39	They discuss whether the animal should be offered to Vayu or Prajapati. If one offers it to Vayu, one goes to Prajapati. If one offers it to Prajapati, one goes to Vayu. If any animal is offered to Agni, one should offer a cake to Agni Vaiśvānara. Since the animal is offered to Vayu, it does not go to Vayu.
19.8.40	By the cake to Prajapati, he goes to Prajapati.
19.8.41	By the cake on twelve potsherds, he goes to the twelve-month year, to the year, to Agni Vaisvānara.
19.8.42	By that, because of his being Vaisvānaraness, he goes to Agni Vaisvarana.
19.9.1	He offers a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni-Vishnu.
19.9.2	Agni is all the deities.
19.9.3	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
19.9.4	and the gods and the sacrifice.
19.9.5	The gods' mouth is Agni, Vishnu is the end.
19.9.6	He took the ends of the sacrifice.
19.9.7	Then a rice-cake of ghee for the Adityas.
19.9.8	The Adityas came to this world from above.
19.9.9	The Aditvas are these creatures, the Adityas are the most excellent.
19.9.10	He approaches his own deity.
19.9.11	It is made of ghee.
19.9.12	The Adityas are indeed portions of ghee.
19.9.13	Now, for Agni Vaisvānara, a cake on twelve potsherds.
19.9.14	The year is Agni Vaisvânara.
19.9.15	The year has twelve months. For the attainment of the year.
19.9.16	He who builds Agni without a womb enters the womb of the sacrificer.
19.9.17	He burns him.
19.9.18	The year indeed is Agni Vaisvarana.
19.9.19	The year is the womb of Agni.
19.9.20	He builds him with the womb-verse for Agni Vaiśvānara, for he is the womb of the year.
19.9.21	This is Agni's dear body, the one that is Vaiśvānari.
19.9.22	He takes the dear body of Agni Vaiśvănara, having made it an oblation, for he is dear to his own body.
19.9.23	Agni Vaiśvānaran is desire.
19.9.24	When one offers to Agni Vaiśvānara, one attains the desire for which it is given.
19.9.25	When it is in twelve potsherds, the year has twelve months.
19.9.26	Those beings that perish, they perish from the year.
19.9.27	Those that stand firm, they stand firm in the year.
19.9.28	He carries Agni in the year itself for stability.
19.10.1-9	He offers six times the Yajus recited during the recitation. There are six seasons. He consecrates him with the seasons. He generates his energy with the seasons. He offers seven times. There are seven vital airs. He consecbrates him with the vital airs. (He offers) separately. Therefore the vital airs are of different kinds. The eye, the ear, the speech,
19.10.10	He offers the Anushtubh verse as the last.
19.10.11	Anushtubh is speech.
19.10.12	He makes speech the last.
19.10.13	Therefore speech is the last of the vital airs. It speaks what is prescribed.
19.10.14	Anushtup is all the metres.
19.10.15	Cattle are the metres.
19.10.16	Food is cattle.
19.10.17	He wins cattle and food.
19.10.18	Whatever is in the embers, he obtains by that. Whatever is in the fire, he obtains by it.
19.10.19	The embers are to be turned over.
19.10.20	The future will be more than the past.
19.10.21	"Do not be afraid, do not be hurt." By this he strengthens her.
19.10.22	"You have risen without injury at this sacrifice." For the sake of unity.
19.10.23	He turns over with two (verses).
19.10.24	The sacrificer with two feet is established for the sake of stability.
19.10.25	For one who desires to shine,
19.10.26	The embryo is consecrated.
19.10.27	For indeed, he becomes like that.
19.10.28	He generates him from that very (source).
19.10.29	Having churned, one should place it in a vessel that has lost its edge.
19.10.30	For indeed it is a being.
19.10.31	He approaches his own deity.
19.10.32	Having taken it from another, he should place it for him whom he desires to make his enemy. He makes him an enemy.
19.10.33	He should place it in the place of roasting for one who desires food.
19.10.34	Food is prepared in the place of cooking.
19.10.35	He obtains food of the same kind.
19.10.36	He should put it on a tree that is burning above for one who desires heaven.
19.10.37	This is the auspicious Agni of the heavenly world for the attainment of the heavenly world.
19.10.38	He places the Krimuka, smeared with ghee, saying, "The Krimuka is the food of Agni, the ghee is the nourishment."
19.10.39	The dear body of Agni entered the Krimuka.
19.10.40	Ghee is brilliance.
19.10.41	He anoints his dear body with brilliance.
19.10.42	He places Muñja grass.
19.10.43	Muñja grass is energy.
19.10.44	He bestows strength on him.
19.10.45	"On the other side of the year" - the Udumbara (twig).
19.10.46	The Udumbara is strength.
19.10.47	He bestows strength on it.
19.10.48	"On this side of the highest" - the Vaikankata (twig).
19.10.49	When Agni was created, his radiance reached the Vaikankatas.
19.10.50	He obtains that.
19.10.51	"Whatever Agni has done" -
19.10.52	Agni does not burn what has been cut with an axe.
19.10.53	The sage made it palatable to him by these offerings.
19.10.54	When one offers kindling wood with these (offerings), he makes it palatable to him.
19.10.55	His food becomes palatable, he who knows this.
19.10.56	The Chhandas are the womb of Agni.
19.10.57	Whatever he places with the metres, he nourishes it with its own womb.
19.10.58	"He says, "They bear the night after night without ceasing," he is asking for a blessing."
19.10.59	"He says "Agni, the one who is kindled from the navel of the earth," he conquers the enemies by this."
19.10.60	"The ones who are the enemies, the ones who are the destroyers," when Agni was born, the demons attacked him,
19.10.61	Those gods saw these verses.
19.10.62	With them they drove away the demons from here.
19.10.63	When he lays down the kindling woods with these (verses), it is for the sake of driving away the demons.
19.10.64	Now this is the Malimlā.
19.10.65	The gods and the Asuras were contending.
19.10.66	Those gods saw this Malimlā (verse).
19.10.67	With it they overcame the Asuras.
19.10.68	When he lays down the kindling woods, it is for the sake of overpowering his enemy.
19.10.69	Therefore, when they build a fire of equal size, they become thieves.
19.10.70	"The woods of the Udumbara tree are those which are used in the army for protection."
19.10.71	When the gods divided the food, the Udumbara was born from it.
19.10.72	He bestows food on the one who is born.
19.10.73	With the fangs, O Agni, the Malimbas. With the leaves of the ashvattha tree.
19.10.74	This is indeed the vanquisher of enemies among the trees, for victory.
19.10.75	If one were to say, "With the fangs," one should mentally think of the one whom one hates.
19.10.76	The mind is more powerful than speech.
19.10.77	He offers him the oblation that has become Agni.
19.10.78	Those who are among men, the Vaikankati (kindling wood) is called 'Malamlava'.
19.10.79	The Vikankata light of Agni, when created, reached it.
19.10.80	He indeed obtains that (light).
19.10.81	"He who would do us harm" (is said) with the Sami wood, for peace.
19.10.82	"He who censures us, from greed" (is said).
19.10.83	Therefore one who has kindled the fire should not utter anything indecent.
19.10.84	The Brahman is indeed the most refined; the Kshatra is refined by the Brahman, and the Brahman by the Kshatra.
19.10.85	Therefore the Kshatra, with the Brahman as its priest, is superior to other Kshatras.
19.10.86	Therefore the Brahman, like the Kshatra (in power), is superior to other Brahmanas.
19.10.87	"He raises their arms, he raises their radiance and strength." He indeed blesses.
19.10.88	I destroy the enemies of Brahman, I raise up my own. As per the Yajus.
19.11.1	The golden one shines with light, having spread out. One should release the golden one.
19.11.2	Death is Agni, immortality is gold.
19.11.3	One covers up death with immortality.
19.11.4	There are twenty-one obstructions for stability.
19.11.5	There are twenty-one worlds of the gods.
19.11.6	He overcomes his enemies from them.
19.11.7	He should overcome those outside.
19.11.8	He overcomes him from these worlds.
19.11.9	He turns around on both sides when releasing.
19.11.10	He divides him by both worlds.
19.11.11	"He says, "At night and in the morning," he embraces him by day and night.
19.11.12	The gods, holding Agni, gave him wealth.
19.11.13	The gods are the vital airs, and they give wealth.
19.11.14	He supports him with the vital airs.
19.11.15	The sling is six cubits long.
19.11.16	There are six seasons.
19.11.17	He encloses him with the seasons.
19.11.18	The sling has twelve cubits.
19.11.19	There are twelve months in a year.
19.11.20	He binds him with the rope in a year.
19.11.21	It is made of Muñja grass.
19.11.22	Muñja grass is energy.
19.11.23	He binds him with energy.
19.11.24	One should not wear it below the navel.
19.11.25	Fire would burn his semen.
19.11.26	One should wear it above the navel.
19.11.27	Above the navel is the divine.
19.11.28	Fire is all the deities.
19.11.29	He bears the deity along with the gods.
19.11.30	"He releases (the Soma) with 'All forms' for the sake of propagation."
19.11.31	He releases while seated.
19.11.32	Therefore, offspring are born while seated.
19.11.33	"He is Suparna, the Garutman."
19.11.34	These are the requisites of Agni.
19.11.35	He collects Agni with these.
19.11.36	This is Agni's beloved abode.
19.11.37	He thus obtains that very (heaven).
19.11.38	"He goes to heaven, O Lord of heaven," for the attainment of the world of heaven.
19.11.39	These worlds belonged to the Asuras.
19.11.40	The gods said to Vishnu,
19.11.41	"He gives us as long as this boy is active."
19.11.42	He stepped on this earth once, the Gayatri metre.
19.11.43	Once on the sky, the Tristubh metre,
19.11.44	The Gāyatrī metre is recited once.
19.11.45	The Anushtubh metre is recited once in all directions.
19.11.46	Those gods won these worlds from the Asuras.
19.11.47	Then the gods became victorious, the Asuras became defeated.
19.11.48	He who, knowing this, recites the steps, wins these worlds from his enemy.
19.11.49	One becomes oneself.
19.11.50	One's enemy becomes defeated.
19.11.51	With the verse, "Agni has cried out," Vatsapriya Bhālandana attained Agni's beloved abode.
19.11.52	One attains Agni's beloved dwelling with this very verse.
19.11.53	"O Agni, returning, O Agni, Angiras, again with energy and wealth," one returns again.
19.11.54	Therefore, domestic animals come to the village from the forest in the evening.
19.11.55	with four (verses).
19.11.56	For the animals have four feet.
19.11.57	The gift turns around.
19.11.58	Therefore the right half of the body is more vigorous.
19.11.59	"He says, "I have brought you to yourself," for he brings him to himself."
19.11.60	"May all the classes desire you, may the kingdom be established in us."
19.11.61	He who desires a kingdom should mentally contemplate him.
19.11.62	The nation itself is (his) country.
19.11.63	"The best noose of Varuna is above us," so Shunashepa, who was seized by Varuna, saw.
19.11.64	By that he was freed from Varuna's noose.
19.11.65	He is freed from Varuna by this.
19.11.66	"Standing above the bright ones, he is in front, the great one."
19.11.67	Papman is darkness.
19.11.68	He thus removes evil.
19.11.69	"He pleases the Sapta rivers with the words, "The swan is in the pure ones."
19.11.70	"The word "sat" means "true."
19.11.71	He thus establishes him in the true.
19.11.72	He places him on a seat.
19.11.73	The one who is carried in the cauldron is indeed the most auspicious of the fires.
19.11.74	Therefore he places him on a wooden seat.
19.11.75	If he were to place it below, the foetuses would be born prematurely.
19.11.76	He places it above, for the stability of the foetuses and for their not being born prematurely.
19.11.77	With three (verses) he stands up.
19.11.78	There are three vital airs: Prāṇa, Vyāna and Apāna.
19.11.79	He places them in the sacrificer.
19.11.80	These are the three worlds.
19.11.81	He prospers in these worlds.
19.12.1	Now this is the Vatsa-rite.
19.12.2	By this very one, Vatsaprin Bhaalandana attained the dear abode of Agni.
19.12.3	By this very one, one attains the dear abode of the very Agni.
19.12.4	By means of this very one, he conquered the praise of the sages.
19.12.5	By means means of this very praise, one conquers sin.
19.12.6	By means this very one, conquered the curses.
19.12.7	He who, knowing this, worships with this (verse), conquers the curses.
19.12.8	He supports the day by the steps he takes, and the night by the worship.
19.12.9	He takes the steps on the previous day.
19.12.10	He worships on the next day.
19.12.11	Therefore the mind of other creatures is in the day, and the peace of others.
19.12.12	Therefore the Yāyāvarī rules over peace.
19.12.13	Therefore the Yāyāvarīya (rite) is the most auspicious.
19.12.14	It becomes the eleventh.
19.12.15	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
19.12.16	The Tristup is energy.
19.12.17	One indeed obtains energy.
19.12.18	There was only one in the beginning.
19.12.19	Then the sages saw the two-fold Agnihotra for Agni.
19.12.20	Therefore they perform the two-fold Agnicayana.
19.12.21	This is the imitation of the two-fold offering.
19.12.22	"The All-gods have raised thee up." The All-gods are the breaths.
19.12.23	He raises him up with the breaths.
19.12.24	The All-gods are men.
19.12.25	He raises up him with men.
19.12.26	"May men support thee with their thoughts." He supports him with that thought with which he raises him up.
19.12.27	"O Agni, come with light!" He is now indeed burning his creatures. For peace.
19.12.28	If he were to bark, one should recite the verse, "Agni has cried out."
19.12.29	For the Anasvins carry him away when he cries.
19.12.30	Therefore the Anasvin and the charioteer are the most honoured of guests.
19.12.31	"O Lord of Food, give us food!" He gives him food.
19.12.32	"Of the one without disease, the shining one."
19.12.33	This means "of the one without disease."
19.12.34	"May the giver lead us to the giver, may he bestow on us strength, on the two-footed and the four-footed." He prays for a blessing.
19.12.35	Having anointed with ghee, he places the kindling wood, saying, "May I be united with Agni."
19.12.36	Just as one cooks ghee for a guest brahmin, so it is done.
19.12.37	One should offer the Gāyatrī verse to a brahmin.
19.12.38	Because a brahmin is Gāyatrī.
19.12.39	The Tristubh verse to a kṣatriya.
19.12.40	Because a kṣatriy is Tristubh.
19.12.41	The Jagatī verse to a vaiśya.
19.12.42	Because vaiśya is Jagatī.
19.12.43	According to the respective verses.
19.12.44	"The goddesses of the waters accept this ash." He scatters the ash in the water.
19.12.45	The waters are the womb of Agni.
19.12.46	He sends him to his own womb.
19.12.47	With three (verses).
19.12.48	Agni is threefold.
19.12.49	He sends Agni to his own extent.
19.12.50	He who scatters ashes in water, scatters Agni.
19.12.51	"He sits down again with the light, united with his mothers." He thus places light in him.
19.12.52	He who scatters ashes into water, is separated from his cattle and energy.
19.12.53-56	Again with energy and wealth. Thus he again obtains energy and cattle. "The most excellent one, O Indra, understands my words." Therefore the offspring of those who sleep wake up. "The wise Sura, O Maghavan," Therefore cattle, having gone out and grazed, return and sit down as they like.
19.12.57	The sacrificer with two feet is established for stability.
20.1.1	He approaches the divine assembly, saying, "Gone, departed, and spread out."
20.1.2	If one were to build a fire without first offering to the divine assembly, the fires would be built for Yama.
20.1.3	Yama is his overlord.
20.1.4	One should build a fire for oneself after offering to the divine community, which is Yama, as the overlord.
20.1.5	The gods, desiring immortality, did not know it.
20.1.6	When one builds the fire altar with this (verse), one builds the fire of immortality.
20.1.7	Sanaschāva said: "This (verse) has fallen from the abode of the Yajurveda."
20.1.8	Agni should be built in the beloved abode of heaven.
20.1.9	Uṣa is the dear abode of heaven.
20.1.10	When he pours down sand, he builds Agni in the dear abode of Heaven.
20.1.11	These are the bricks of Vaiśvānara, the unlimited sand.
20.1.12	When he puts down sand, he wins them.
20.1.13	This is the dear body of Agni Vaiśvānari, the sand.
20.1.14	He thereby wins the same (fire).
20.1.15	This is the hymn of Visvamitra: "This is the Agni."
20.1.16	By this (hymn) Visvamitra won the dear abode of Agni.
20.1.17	By this (verse) he wins the dear abode of the Agni.
20.1.18	He lays down four towards the east.
20.1.19	There are four metres.
20.1.20	The gods went to the heavenly world by means of the metres.
20.1.21	Their directions were lost.
20.1.22	They saw these directions.
20.1.23	They established the directions by means of them.
20.1.24	When he lays down two in front and two behind, it is for the support of the directions.
20.1.25	He lays down eight of these.
20.1.26	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
20.1.27	The Gayatra knows the heavenly world by direct means.
20.1.28	For the knowledge of the world of heaven.
20.1.29	He lays down eight (bricks) -
20.1.30	The Gayatri has eight syllables,
20.1.31	Agni is Gayatri,
20.1.32	He builds up Agni as much as he is.
20.1.33	Having laid down these eight (bricks), he lays down thirteen Lokamprana (bricks).
20.1.34	They become twenty-one.
20.1.35	Twenty-one is the established number of Stomas,
20.1.36	The Garhapatya is the established one.
20.1.37	One who knows this stands firm with the Garhapatya fire, following the firm foundation of the twenty-one (bricks).
20.1.38	One who knows this stands firmly by the fire when he is being built.
20.1.39	One who is building for the first time should build a five-layered (fire-altar).
20.1.40	The sacrifice is fivefold.
20.1.41	Animals are fivefold.
20.1.42	He wins the sacrifice and animals.
20.1.43	One who builds for the second time should build a three-layered (fire altar).
20.1.44	These are the three worlds.
20.1.45	One prospers in these worlds alone.
20.1.46	One who performs the Ekaciti sacrifice, performs the supreme sacrifice.
20.1.47	One who goes to heaven alone.
20.1.48	There are five layers.
20.1.49	There are the five kinds of soil.
20.1.50	That makes ten.
20.1.51	The Viraj has ten syllables.
20.1.52	Food is Viraj.
20.1.53	One stands firm in food through Viraj.
20.1.54	The bone is the brick, the flesh is the excrement.
20.1.55	When he covers the brick with excrement, therefore the bone is covered with flesh.
20.1.56	He who knows this does not become one with bad skin.
20.1.57	He puts down the bricks with the words, "You should be of equal size."
20.1.58	The two fires that are carried in the ox-cart and those that are piled up are the two classes among the fires.
20.1.59	The Brahman and the Kshatra are equal.
20.1.60	The Brahman is the Yajus.
20.1.61	He places them together with Brahman.
20.1.62	He places together with four (verses).
20.1.63	There are four metres.
20.1.64	He places the two together with the metres.
20.1.65	This is Agni's dear body, namely the metres.
20.1.66	He instructs them with their own dear body.
20.2.2	The three black ones are cooked in husks.
20.2.3	For the black ones are the colour of that which Nirriti seizes.
20.2.4	This is indeed the share of Nirriti.
20.2.5	By means of the form and the share, he appeases Nirriti.
20.2.6	"He gives (the oblation) to Vaisvânara, saying, 'What is beyond this dust.'
20.2.7	He appeases it.
20.2.8	They carry this direction.
20.2.9	They carry him to that direction which Nirriti seizes.
20.2.10	This is the direction of Nirriti.
20.2.11	He appeases Nirriti in his own direction.
20.2.12	He places the stone of his own doing.
20.2.13	This is her Nirriti-seized.
20.2.14	Wherever he appeases Nirriti, there he appeases Nirrti.
20.2.15-21	He places it with the point towards himself. He thus appeases Nirriti with the point towards him. He places three (bricks). Man is divided into three parts. He appeases Nirriti from as much as his body is. Placing the noose, he says, 'The goddess Nirriti bound thee.' The noose is Nirriti.
20.2.22	He releases him from the noose of Nirriti.
20.2.23	Those who move towards the south go to the world of the fathers.
20.2.24	The Ahavanīya is the world of the gods.
20.2.25	When he approaches the Ahavanīya, he approaches the world of the Gods.
20.2.26	He approaches with a Tristubh verse.
20.2.27	The Tristubh is power.
20.2.28	He places power in him.
20.2.29	With one (verse).
20.2.30	He places the strength in one place only.
20.3.1	He measures with a bamboo stick as long as a man with arms raised.
20.3.2	That is the extent of the strength in a man.
20.3.3	He measures him with strength.
20.3.4	He measures three men facing east and four men facing west.
20.3.5	Therefore, he eats food from seven men, three in front and three behind, the self being the seventh.
20.3.6	He places the two arms at the length of an arm, and the tail at the length of a span.
20.3.7	The sacrifice is equal to a man.
20.3.8	The sacrifice and the man are equal.
20.3.9	Therefore, the arms are longer than the legs.
20.3.10	He ploughs with a six-yoke.
20.3.11	There are six seasons.
20.3.12	By means of the seasons.
20.3.13	He accomplishes three-three (seasons).
20.3.14	Agni is threefold.
20.3.15	They become twelve.
20.3.16	Twelve months are a year.
20.3.17	He follows the form of the year.
20.3.18	And having ploughed by means of the seasons, he stands firm in the year.
20.3.19	This (earth) was afraid of Agni's burning.
20.3.20	She made this field twice as large, both cultivated and uncultivated.
20.3.21	What is cultivated and unculti-vated, it is for her non-burning.
20.3.22	And with twice the strength she makes her effort.
20.3.23	These are the animals, those with two feet and those with four feet.
20.3.24	He puts them back in Agni.
20.3.25	If one were to let loose towards the north, one would be giving the cattle to Rudra and would become without cattle.
20.3.26	If one were to let them loose towards the south, one would be offering them to the Fathers.
20.3.27	If one lets them loose towards the west, the Rakshas would kill them.
20.3.28	One lets them loose towards south and east, towards the sun.
20.3.29	The sun is the life of cattle.
20.3.30	One lets loose them towards the life.
20.3.31	With the verses of the plants, he sows the fruits of the plants.
20.3.32	He indeed wins food with its form.
20.3.33	He sows for every kind of food.
20.3.34	He indeed gains all kinds of food.
20.3.35	If he does not sow for someone, he is deprived of it.
20.3.36	If he were to not sow for someone then he should mentally contemplate it.
20.3.37	He indeed obtains it by that.
20.3.38	He sows with fourteen (verses).
20.3.39	The seven plants are of the village, the seven are of the forest.
20.3.40	He wins them both.
20.3.41	Food is the sun.
20.3.42	The sun is Agni.
20.3.43	Herein he wins the sun.
20.3.44	He sows in the ploughed (field).
20.3.45	For in the ploughed field the plants stand firm.
20.3.46	(He sows) in the sown (field), for propagation.
20.3.47	He sows on twelve furrows.
20.4.7-14	He becomes greedy. He pours down the northern altar. For the fire is piled on the northern altar. And also (he does so) because the sacrifice is not interrupted. The northern altar is indeed the animals. He indeed wins the animals. With the six verses, "O Agni, thy fame is ours," he pours down. There are six seasons, a year.
20.4.15	The year is Agni Vaiśvānara.
20.4.16	He wins Vaiśvānaran by means of form.
20.4.17	The first one has eight syllables.
20.4.18	Animals have eight kinds of hoofs.
20.4.19	He wins animals.
20.4.20	The unequal and excessive ones are for procreation.
20.4.21	This is the name of the metre of Prajapati, the ocean.
20.4.22	Animals are born from the ocean for the propagation of animals.
20.4.23	Indra struck Vritra with the thunderbolt.
20.4.24	It became three-fold: the wooden mallet was one-third, the sacrificial post was one-third and the chariot was one-third.
20.4.25	What broke off were the gravels.
20.4.26	The animal is Agni, the thunderbolt is gravels.
20.4.27	Whatever he encloses with sugar, he encloses the animals for him with the thunderbolt.
20.4.28	Therefore the animals are held by the thunderbolt.
20.4.29	That is why one does not give to one who is not as good as oneself.
20.4.30	One should enclose with ten (sugar lumps) for one who desires food.
20.4.31	The Viraj has ten syllables.
20.4.32	Food is Viraj.
20.4.33	He stands firm in the food of Viraj.
20.4.34	Nine times nine for one who is to be attacked.
20.4.35	The thunderbolt is threefold.
20.4.36	He strikes his enemy with the thunderbolt.
20.4.37	Seven times seven for one who desires cattle.
20.4.38	Seven are the vital airs.
20.4.39	Cattle are born from the vital airs; for the propagation of cattle.
20.4.40	He should strew sand without limit for him whom he desires to be without cattle.
20.4.41	His semen is scattered without being held.
20.4.42	He becomes without cattle.
20.4.43	He should strew sand with limit for him whom one desires to be with cattle.
20.4.44	His seed is scattered and held.
20.4.45	He has cattle.
20.4.46-51	The metres are the womb of Agni. Soma is the seed-bestowing one. When he arranges the Somas in the metres, he places the seed in the womb. Therefore the foetus grows in the womb. They are of equal size, but of different shapes. Therefore from the womb of equal size, offspring of different shapes are born.
20.4.52	One should recite the Gāyatrī for a Brāhmaṇa.
20.4.53	For the Brāhmaṇa is Gāyatrī.
20.4.54	The Tristubh for a Kṣatriya.
20.4.55	For the Kṣatriya is Tristubh.
20.4.56	The Jagatī for a Vaiśya.
20.4.57	For a Vaiśya is Jagatī.
20.4.58	According to the respective metres.
20.5.1	One should recite in a low voice.
20.5.2	Now Agni is not specified, when he is not excluded.
20.5.3-9	Therefore one recites the Upamśus. One recites the metres. Agni, with the metres, ascended the Uttaravedi. Therefore one recites the metres They go along the path of the sun when they make the horse step forward and backward. Therefore the sun moves forward and backward. The horse is Prajapati's.
20.5.10	When he places the horse, he builds him up with Prajapati.
20.5.11	He places the lotus leaf, saying, "You are the back of the waters, the womb of Agni."
20.5.12	He builds him up in his own womb for peace and non-injury.
20.5.13	"Growing, great, and beyond the lotus,"
20.5.14	for he who becomes this grows.
20.5.15	"Spread out by the measure of heaven," he spreads out.
20.5.16	He places the golden (brick) with the verse, "Brahman, the first-born, is in front."
20.5.17	Prajapati attained success through the utterances of Brahman and his progeny.
20.5.18	It is twenty-one-fold to establish.
20.5.19	There are twenty-one worlds of gods.
20.5.20	He thus repels his enemy from them.
20.5.21	He should make the fire-places below, for the subjugation of his enemies.
20.5.22	One should not make fire on the earth, in the sky, or in heaven.
20.5.23	If one were to make it on the earth, one would burn the plants with grief; if in the sky, the birds; if in heaven, heaven itself.
20.5.24	Gold is immortal.
20.5.25	When one places gold, one builds the fire with immortality.
20.5.26	"The golden-bodied Person is the first to be born." He places the golden-bodied Person.
20.5.27	He thus supports the world of the sacrificer.
20.5.28	He builds the fire in the middle of the light.
20.5.29	He touches it with the verse, "The drop has fallen."
20.5.30	He establishes him in truth in the Hotr-s.
20.5.31	He worships with the heads of serpents.
20.5.32	He gives him over to Death.
20.5.33	Now, he indeed obtains that very brilliance which is of the serpent.
20.5.34	If one were to place it below, one would be prone to death.
20.5.35	If one places it too close to the other heads, the domestic animals would be afflicted; if too far, the wild animals.
20.5.36	One should speak the Yajus.
20.5.37	By that very brilliance he obtains it, and by that it is pacified.
20.5.38	From this (fire) they formerly sought to see the fire.
20.5.39	For all these rays are bound up in the fire, in the serpent, in the sun.
20.5.40	And this is Vamadeva's Rakshas-destroying (hymn) at the beginning of the sacrifice.
20.5.41	For the Rakshas attack the sacrifice at the beginning of a sacrifice. For the destruction of the Rakshas.
20.5.42	It consists of five verses.
20.5.43	Agni is fivefold.
20.5.44	As much as the fire is, so much does it drive away the Rakshas.
20.5.45	He offers in all directions, going around.
20.5.46	He drives away the Rakshasas from all directions.
20.5.47	He places them with the ladle.
20.5.48	He places these here.
20.5.49	He places silently.
20.5.50	They do not deserve to be obtained with a Yajus.
20.5.51	The man is the Self.
20.5.52	The arms are the ladles.
20.5.53	When he places the ladle, it is for the sake of the Self.
20.5.54	The oblations of the gods were stolen by the Rakshas from the south.
20.5.55	They placed them in the middle with the Karshmarya wood.
20.5.56	When he places the Karshmary wood ladle on the south, it is for hiding the Rakshas.
20.5.57	He fills it with ghee.
20.5.58	Karshmarya is a thunderbolt.
20.5.59	Ghee is a thunderbolt.
20.5.60	He places the thunderbolt on the thunderbolt.
20.5.61	He places the Gayatri verse.
20.5.62	Agni is indeed Gayatri, the Gayatri metre.
20.5.63	He prospers him with his own metre.
20.5.64	He fills the Udumbara vessel with curds.
20.5.65	Curd is indeed food.
20.5.66	Udumbara is energy.
20.5.67	He places food in energy.
20.5.68	He puts the Tristubh verse.
20.5.69	The Tristubh is indeed Indra's.
20.5.70	Food is the sense-organ.
20.5.71	He wins food by means of the sense-organ itself.
20.5.72	This (brick) is made of wood-apple, that of Udumbara.
20.5.73	In that he places the Udumbara brick on the north, therefore it is on the north of this (brick).
20.5.74	It has a point.
20.5.75	The head is made by these two.
20.5.76	Agni should be conceived as Viraj.
20.5.77	The ladle is Viraj.
20.5.78	When he places the bricks with the ladle, he builds Agni with Viraj.
20.6.1	If the Adhvaryu places the first brick without knowing, he obstructs the life of the sacrificer and the life of his offspring and cattle.
20.6.2	It becomes self-perforated for the release of the vital airs, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
20.6.3	The horse is Prajapati's.
20.6.4	When he makes the horse smell (the earth), he makes it out of Prajapati.
20.6.5	This is the self-sprouting (grass).
20.6.6	He puts it down here.
20.6.7	If one thinks that his enemy has gone before him, he should carry it towards the east.
20.6.8	He drives away with it the enemy who has gone before him.
20.6.9	If he thinks, "My enemy is behind me," he should drive it away to the west.
20.6.10	He drives away the enemy who is behind him.
20.6.11	He drives the superior enemy away.
20.6.12	He drives an inferior enemy away.
20.6.13	If he thinks, "I am equal to him," he should shake it.
20.6.14	The offspring that were born here were driven away and became others.
20.6.15	This very (earth) shakes him.
20.6.16	Now this is the Dūrvā brick.
20.6.17	The Agni is an animal.
20.6.18	Animals do not delight in a place of rest.
20.6.19	He makes it a place of rest for animals, for the stability of animals.
20.6.20	It grows from stalk to stalk, for stability.
20.6.21	With a thousand and a hundred.
20.6.22	The thousandfold is measured by Prajapati.
20.6.23	He who, knowing this, places it, goes to a thousandfold prosperity of cattle.
20.6.24	Now this is the one that takes the left.
20.6.25	By means of this the gods took the left cattle of the Asuras.
20.6.26	By means means of this one takes the left cattle of one's enemy.
20.6.27	It has two verses.
20.6.28	By means one takes the world of one's enemies by means of the one with two verses.
20.6.29	For in this world, the second is the enemy.
20.6.30	One becomes the lord of gold.
20.6.31	One goes to heaven, the world of light.
20.6.32	The two arms are made of gold.
20.6.33	Therefore, the eyes are the two arms.
20.6.34	Then these two are the seed-seed.
20.6.35	This is the king of heaven.
20.6.36	This is Viraj.
20.6.37	A man sprinkles seed on a woman lying supine.
20.6.38	He pours the semen into this (earth).
20.6.39	This generates.
20.6.40	Fire eats.
20.6.41	One builds up fire with semen.
20.6.42	One is born, eats food, he who knowing thus puts these down.
20.6.43	"He puts down (the brick) with the formula, "Thou art the lord of the self."
20.6.44	Therefore a man lies down on the right side of a woman.
20.6.45	If he were to build in the earlier age, he should place it in the first layer.
20.6.46	It would be the same as the semen being deposited.
20.6.47	He should place the other one in the one he hates.
20.6.48	He would be weakening his semen.
20.6.49	If he were to build at the later age, he should put one in the first layer and the other in the last layer.
20.6.50	The semen is indeed deposited by these two.
20.6.51	He places the Rtuvyas (bricks) for the sake of holding the seasons.
20.6.52	He places two (bricks) each.
20.6.53	For there are two seasons each.
20.6.54	Now this is drawn with three lines.
20.6.55	The gods and the Asuras indeed performed the sacrifice together.
20.6.56	Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did that.
20.6.57	Those gods saw this (verse) written in three lines.
20.6.58	They placed it with the auspicious characteristics facing upwards.
20.6.59	The Asuras did not follow it.
20.6.60	Then the gods became (victorious),
20.6.61	the Asuras became (defeated).
20.6.62	He who, knowing this, places it with the auspicious characteristic facing upwards, becomes victorious over his enemy. He becomes victorious over his own self, and his enemy becomes defeated.
20.6.63	He should place the lower mark on the one whom he hates.
20.6.64	He destroys him by means of the womb of the Asuras.
20.6.65	These worlds are marked with three lines.
20.6.66	He obtains these worlds by this.
20.6.67	One should make this for the one whose mud is used to make the pot.
20.6.68	By this, all his bricks become luminous and have mantras.
20.7.1	The tortoise is indeed the intelligence of animals.
20.7.2	When he places the tortoise, the animals stand around him, knowing that he is the intelligence.
20.7.3	He places it alive.
20.7.4	It is indeed intelligent.
20.7.5	It has four feet.
20.7.6	There are four directions.
20.7.7	It stands firm in the directions.
20.7.8	The earth and heaven are the same. He thus supports the form of heaven and earth.
20.7.9	He anoints with curds and honey.
20.7.10	Honey is indeed the sap of plants and water.
20.7.11	When he anoints with honey, he obtains the sap of plants.
20.7.12	Curds is indeed the sap and strength of animals.
20.7.13	Whatever he anoints with curds, he places the brilliance and energy of cattle.
20.7.14	One Agni is made of bricks, another is made of animals.
20.7.15	When he places the living tortoise, he makes it animal-oriented.
20.7.16	This is the highest step of the heavenly world.
20.7.17	Just as a farmer, knowing the field, leads the cattle to the right place, so does this (fire) lead him to heaven.
20.7.18	The fire should be built on Vishnu's navel.
20.7.19	One who builds a fire on the navel enters the navel of the sacrificer.
20.7.20	He burns him.
20.7.21	This is indeed Vishnu's navel.
20.7.22	When he places the mortar, he builds Agni on Vishnu's navel.
20.7.23	It is made of Udumbara wood.
20.7.24	Udumbara is energy.
20.7.25	He places energy in the middle, in the sacrificer and in the offspring.
20.7.26	Therefore, offspring are energetic in the middle.
20.7.27	It is the size of a span.
20.7.28	This is the size of Vishnu's navel.
20.7.29	He places the two (bricks) in the place of the rite of Vishnu.
20.7.30	For this is a rite that is performed.
20.7.31	Now this is the Ukhā.
20.7.32	This is the strength and energy that is collected.
20.7.33	He obtains strength and energy.
20.7.34	He obtains the light of these worlds.
20.7.35	He places the light in the middle.
20.7.36	He builds Agni with light in the middle.
20.7.37	Therefore they worship the light in the middle.
20.7.38	He fills it with sand, with his own place.
20.7.39	For this is the ash of Agni Vaisvānara, namely sand.
20.7.40	He wins Vaisvānaran by means of form.
20.7.41	If he were to place it less than full, the sacrificer would be hungry.
20.7.42	He places it full.
20.7.43	The sacrificer becomes non-hungry.
20.7.44	He eats the food without reciting any mantra.
20.7.45	He fills it with ghee.
20.7.46	This is indeed the dear abode of Agni, namely ghee.
20.7.47	He makes it prosper with its own dear abode.
20.8.1	Having placed twenty-one beans, he brings the head of a man.
20.8.2	Beans are impure.
20.8.3	The head of a man is impure.
20.8.4	He buys the impure with the impure.
20.8.5-13	There are twenty-one. Man is twenty-one. He buys him as big as his own self. He places the mound of the seven-layered earth. This is contrary to the vital airs. There are seven vital airs in the head. He makes it complete with vital airs. He sings the Yama-song. He wins him from the world of Yama.
20.8.14	He sings three times.
20.8.15	These three are the worlds.
20.8.16	He takes away from these worlds.
20.8.17	Therefore, one should not give (anything) while singing.
20.8.18	One takes away only the verses.
20.8.19	From here, indeed, the senses, the vital airs, the head, the strength, the eye, the ear, and the speech go away.
20.8.20	The senses become impaired and impure.
20.8.21	This is what they call the dead head.
20.8.22	The gold is pure.
20.8.23	When he offers with gold plates, he makes it pure and fit for sacrifice.
20.8.24	Having placed it in the pot, he offers.
20.8.25	Having led it to the firm foundation, he makes it prosper with the vital airs.
20.8.26	He places the human head with the formula, "Thou art the giver of a thousand, for a thousand thee."
20.8.27	The man indeed gives a thousand animals.
20.8.28	Other animals are a thousand.
20.8.29	When he places the head of a man in the middle, it is for the sake of being.
20.8.30	Then these are the heads of animals.
20.8.31	These indeed are the thousand bricks, Somadatta Kauśreya, son of Śyāmaparṇa, placed.
20.8.32	From then on he went to the thousandfold prosperity of animals.
20.8.33	He who, knowing this, places them thus, obtains a thousandfold increase of cattle.
20.8.34	He places the head of the horse in front, facing west, and the head of the bull in back, facing east.
20.8.35	He places cattle and horses in order in him.
20.8.36	One should place them in order if one desires, "May he be possessed of cattle."
20.8.37	He places cattle in order in him.
20.8.38	He should place the stakes in a straight line, if he wishes, 'May he be without cattle.'
20.8.39	He makes the cattle turn away from him.
20.8.40	The Adhvaryu should not pass between the heads of the animals.
20.8.41	This Agni is indeed called the most excellent.
20.8.42	He would take away his life, he would perish.
20.8.43	Having placed one (stake), he should worship with all of them.
20.8.44	He should place it everywhere, without leaving anything out.
20.8.45	All the (other) things are placed on it.
20.8.46	The Adhvaryu does not suffer any pain.
20.8.47	He does not suffer any loss.
20.8.48	These are the animals, the two-footed and the four-footed.
20.8.49	He offers them to the pure (fire).
20.9.4	When he places the Apasyā bricks, he places the seed in the womb.
20.9.5	When the animal is born, then it is born.
20.9.6	Animals are the Chhandasya bricks.
20.9.7	When he places the Apasya bricks after the Chhandas bricks, it is for the propagation of animals.
20.9.8	He places five (bricks).
20.9.9	Animals are fivefold.
20.9.10	He generates the animal as much as it is.
20.9.11	This (earth) was afraid of Agni's burning.
20.9.12	She created these Apasyas.
20.9.13	She placed them.
20.9.14	Because the Apasyas are placed, (it is) for the non-burning of this (earth).
20.9.15	He said, "This is to be given."
20.9.16	"He who places these gives food to the Brahmans."
20.9.17	He who, knowing this, places these, eats the food of the Brahmans.
20.9.18	He places five Apasyas in front, facing west.
20.9.19	Therefore, an animal is born in front, facing east.
20.9.20	Five are to the south, and five to the north.
20.9.21	Therefore a man lies with a woman from the south.
20.9.22	Five are behind, and five in front.
20.9.23	Therefore semen is deposited from the west to the east.
20.9.24	Five are to the north, and five to Chandasya.
20.9.25	Animals are the northernmost, animals are the most distant.
20.9.26	He places the animals, which are born, around their own abode, for the non-injury of animals.
20.9.27	One should not place them from the north.
20.9.28	If one were to place them, the offspring would be taken away by Varuna.
20.9.29	He places them in the direction of the wind, for the life of the offspring.
20.9.30	When the semen is deposited, he places the life, mind, sight, hearing, and speech.
20.9.31-38	Therefore, the animal is born seeing, hearing, speaking, and breathing. "This is the eastern direction." Those that have life, he places in the east. He places life in the east. Therefore, the animal breathes towards the east. "This (is) the southern direction, the creator." Those that are endowed with mind, he places in south. He places mind in the south.
20.9.39-46	Therefore the right half is more intelligent. Therefore they attend to the mind on the right side. This is the back, with all-embracing space. Those that have sight are in the back. He places sight in the back. Therefore the animal looks towards the east. This is above, the heaven. Those that are endowed with hearing are above.
20.9.47-54	He places the ear in the north. Therefore, the animal hears more from the north. This is the highest wisdom. The words are in the middle. He places speech in the middle. Therefore, speech is spoken from the middle. The eyes are placed. Therefore, with the eyes, the limbs and animals go away.
20.9.55	Those which he placed in front, by them Vasishtha prospered.
20.9.56	Those which were on the right, by them Bharadvaja.
20.9.57	Those which are in the back, by them Jamadagni.
20.9.58	Those which in the north, by them Vishvamitra.
20.9.59	Those which at the centre, by them Vishvakarman.
20.9.60	He who knows thus the prosperity of these (goddesses) prospers.
20.9.61	He who knows the binding of these, is bound to them.
20.9.62	He who knows the kinship of these, becomes related to them.
20.9.63	"He who knows the source of these, becomes the source of them."
20.9.64	"He who know the abode of these, becomes their abode."
20.9.65	"He becomes the abode of these."
20.9.66	"He knows the source of them, and becomes the source of these."
20.10.1	Now these are the Ashvini (bricks).
20.10.2	The fire-altar is indeed a neglected sacrifice.
20.10.3	Who knows how much of it is not done, how much is not piled up? With these (bricks) he makes it up, and heals it.
20.10.4	He lays down five of them.
20.10.5	Agni is fivefold.
20.10.6	He heals him to the extent that Agni is.
20.10.7	He arranges the directions with these (verses) of Agni.
20.10.8	"He places thee on the back of Aditi."
20.10.9	He thus supports these worlds.
20.10.10	He places the Rituviya (bricks) - for the fulfilment of the seasons.
20.10.11	He places five (bricks).
20.10.12	There are five seasons.
20.10.13	He arranges as many seasons as there are.
20.10.14	The seasons beginning with Sama are of equal size.
20.10.15	The seasons beginning with Sama have equal size.
20.10.16	One turns them around with one Vyahrti.
20.10.17	Therefore the seasons turn around.
20.10.18	Therefore the different forms of the year of Sama are.
20.10.19	He places the Ashvini stars in accordance with the seasons.
20.10.20	He places them in accordance with the semen, in accordance with the season.
20.10.21	Therefore, the semen is beneficial, and the offspring are born in accordance with the seasons.
20.10.22	He places the Vayu-bricks in accordance with the directions.
20.10.23	He places life in the seasons.
20.10.24	Therefore, these (seasons) are similar and do not decay.
20.10.25	Therefore, the wind blows in accordance with the (seasons).
20.10.26	He places the Apasya-bricks in accordance to the wind.
20.10.27	Therefore, wind carries rain.
20.10.28	By these (verses) he secures rain.
20.10.29	If he were to place them in one layer, there would be rain in one season.
20.10.30	He places them in layers one above the other.
20.10.31	Therefore it rains season by season.
20.10.32	He puts the Apasyas and Anuvasyas (verses) in the middle.
20.10.33	The Anuvasyas are cattle.
20.10.34	Because he puts the Apasyās and Anuvasyās in the middle, therefore cattle have different minds and different vows.
20.10.35-40	The waters are indeed the same as the mind. One should place the Vayasya bricks above the Apsi bricks for one whom one desires to be rich in cattle. The waters are indeed the sign of cattle. One builds the fire with the sign of cattle in mind. One becomes rich in cattle. One should place the Apsi bricks above the Vayasya for one whom one wishes to be poor in cattle.
20.10.41	He piles up the fire for the animals themselves.
20.10.42	He becomes without animals.
20.10.43	He places four (bricks) in front.
20.10.44	Therefore the animal is smaller in front.
20.10.45	There are four forms of the eyes, two white and two black.
20.10.46	They are placed on the head.
20.10.47	Therefore the head of the animals is in front.
20.10.48	Five five times around the animal for the sake of its strength.
20.10.49	Therefore the animal is sloping towards the east.
20.10.50	He places the stone on the south with the verse, "May the bull be our wealth." He places the stone on north with the verse, “May the bull be ours.”
20.10.51	He places the stones on the shoulders.
20.10.52	He places a stone on the right wing with the verse, "May the tiger be our wealth."
20.10.53	He places a tiger on the left wing with the verse "May the lion be our wealth." "He places the stones in the wings, "He places the stones of the wings."
20.10.54	The tiger is in the east, the lion in the west.
20.10.55	Therefore the tiger is born first, then the lion.
20.10.56	The man is in the middle.
20.10.57	Therefore the man is the lord of the animals.
20.11.1	"O Indra and Agni, you two, without being hurt, strengthen the brick." Indra and Agni are strength and virility.
20.11.2	This is the layer of the atmosphere.
20.11.3-9	The sky seems to be loosened. The sky is the offspring. He places strength and vigour in the offspring. It becomes self-perforated for the release of the vital airs, for the attainment of the heavenly world. The horse is Prajapati. When he makes the horse smell, he makes it out of Prajapati. Then these are the directions.
20.11.10	The gods went to the heavenly world, and their directions were scattered.
20.11.11	They saw these directions.
20.11.12	They established the directions with them.
20.11.13	When these are placed, it is for the establishment of the directions.
20.11.14	"You are the queen of the eastern direction." Therefore this is the queen of the directions. "
20.11.15	"You are Viraj, the southern direction." Therefore this shines as Viraj among the directions.
20.11.16-19	"Thou art the sovereign of the western quarter," therefore sovereignty belongs to this quarter. "Thou art the sovereign lord of the northern quarter," therefore lordship belongs to this quarter.
20.11.20	"He places ten bricks in front, saying, 'Protect my life!'
20.11.21	There are nine breaths in man.
20.11.22	The navel is the tenth.
20.11.23	He places the breaths in him.
20.11.24	'Grant me light!' he says of the last one.
20.11.25	He places light at the end.
20.11.26	Therefore speech is the light of the breaths.
20.11.27	He places ten (bricks).
20.11.28	The Viraj has ten syllables.
20.11.29	Viraat is the light of the metres.
20.11.30	The eye is the light.
20.11.31	He places the eye in front of the creatures.
20.11.32	He places (the stone) with the verse, "Do not let the metres go away." on the south.
20.11.33	Therefore the months are turned to the right.
20.11.34	"The earth is the metre," (he places) on the west for support.
20.11.35	"Agni is the deity," (he places it) on the north.
20.11.36	Agni is strength.
20.11.37-42	He places the Ojas in the north. Therefore, he who goes forth from the north conquers. He places twelve in the south, twelve in the west, and twelve in the north. They become thirty-six. Thirty-six syllables are in the Brihatī. The Brihatī attained sovereignty among the metres.
20.11.43	He who, knowing thus, places these (bricks), goes to his own kingdom.
20.11.44	These are thirty-six.
20.11.45	Thirty-six syllables are in the Brihatī.
20.11.46	Cattle are connected with the Brihatī (metre).
20.11.47	This is the layer of the atmosphere.
20.11.48	Cattle are the atmosphere.
20.11.49	He places cattle in cattle.
20.11.50	The Prāṇas are of the nature of the sun, others are of the nature Angiras.
20.11.51	Those in front are of the nature sun.
20.11.52	Those at the back are of the nature angiras.
20.11.53	He places the head in front with the verse, "Thou art the king of the head."
20.11.54	He thus supports those Prāṇas which are of the nature Sun.
20.11.55	He places it at the back with the verse,
20.11.56	The vital airs which are the Angiras-Dhamanis, he placed in that (the head).
20.11.57	He places seven in front and seven behind.
20.11.58	Therefore the lower vital air is the half-share of the upper vital airs.
20.11.59	Prajapati, having created the creatures, desired of them, 'May I be the head.'
20.11.60	He saw these (vital airs) in the head.
20.11.61	He united them.
20.11.62	Their head became (the altar).
20.11.63	That is why they are called the 'head-ones'.
20.11.64	He who knows this and places them, becomes the head of those who are equal.
20.12.1	He places the Trivrit (brick) in front with the verse, "The swift one is Trivrit."
20.12.2	The Trivrit is the mouth of the sacrifice.
20.12.3	He spreads out the mouth of the sacrificie in front.
20.12.4	He places (the brick) called Vyomasa Saptadasa on the right side.
20.12.5	Saptadasa is food.
20.12.6	The food is produced in the seventeenth year.
20.12.7	Food is on the right side.
20.12.8	Therefore a man eats food with his right hand.
20.12.9	Because he places the seventeen-fold (brick) on the right side, therefore the feathers of the right wing fly over.
20.12.10	The twenty-one-fold (brick), on the back, for stability.
20.12.11-17	Then the animals stand back. The fifteen-fold (verse) is from the north. The fifteen is strength. He places strength from the north. Therefore he who goes forth from the north conquers. "The share of Agni, the lordship of consecration," two Trivrt verses in front. He spreads out the mouth of the sacrifice in an orderly manner.
20.12.18	The southern side has fifteen bricks, the northern side seventeen, for the purpose of stability.
20.12.19	Seventeen is food.
20.12.20	When he lays down the seventeen bricks on both sides, he places food on both sides.
20.12.21	Therefore man eats food, holding it with both hands.
20.12.22	The side has twenty-one bricks, for the purpose or stability.
20.12.23	You are the share of Agni, the lordship of consecration.
20.12.24	Indeed, the gods attained this by means of these (bricks).
20.12.25	He indeed attains this by means of them.
20.12.26	These are the bricks called Spritayas.
20.12.27	By one (brick) they praised, offspring increased.
20.12.28	Indeed, by means of these the gods generated this.
20.12.29	By means of these he indeed attains everything.
20.12.30	This is in accordance with the form of Arka.
20.12.31	Food is Arka.
20.12.32	Arka is Agni.
20.12.33	He who knows this is fed with food.
20.13.1	The gods and the Asuras performed the sacrifice together.
20.13.2	Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did.
20.13.3	The gods saw this fourth layer.
20.13.4	Having thus spoken of it, he laid it down otherwise.
20.13.5	The Asuras did not follow it.
20.13.6	Then the gods became victorious, the Asuras became defeated.
20.13.7	He who, knowing this, lays down this fourth layer, becomes victorious over his enemy. He himself becomes victorious, his enemy becomes defeated.
20.13.8	"He lays down (the layer) with the verse, "The swift one is three-fold." In front (he lays down).
20.13.9	The three-fold is the face of the sacrifice.
20.13.10	He places the Yajna-mukha (the mouth of the sacrifice) in front.
20.13.11	The seventeen-fold (verse) is on the right side.
20.13.12	The seventeen is food.
20.13.13	He secures food on the right side alone.
20.13.14	The twenty-one-fold (verse), on the west, for stability.
20.13.15	The fifteen-fold (verse,) on the north.
20.13.16	The fifteen is strength.
20.13.17	He places strength on the north.
20.13.18	Therefore, he who goes forth from the north conquers.
20.13.19	Praturti is eighteen. Thus, in front.
20.13.20	Two Trivrit (verses).
20.13.21	He places the beginning of the sacrifice facing east.
20.13.22	Abhivartas is twenty. Thus, on the right side.
20.13.23	Savish is food.
20.13.24	He secures food on the right side itself.
20.13.25	Varcas is twenty-two. Thus, behind.
20.13.26	The two feet of the sacrificer are for stability.
20.13.27	The twenty-two are the two Virājas, food is Virāja, he stands firm in food.
20.13.28	The nine and a half are from the north.
20.13.29	Therefore the left hand is more capable of performing austerities.
20.13.30	The twenty four are from the front.
20.13.31	The twentyfour is the mouth of the sacrifice.
20.13.32	He places the mouth of the sacrifice in front.
20.13.33	The embryo is twenty-five (bricks) on the right side.
20.13.34	The twenty-five is food.
20.13.35	He secures food on the right side;
20.13.36	The ten (bricks) are the Viraj consisting of ten syllables, and the Viraj is food. He is established in food.
20.13.37	The fifteen-fold is the sacrifice. He places the fifteen-fold above, for the destruction of the Raksases.
20.13.38	"The nine-fold is the strength." From the west.
20.13.39	These worlds are nine-fold.
20.13.40	He is established in these worlds.
20.13.41	The twenty-three-fold is the collection. From the north.
20.13.42	Therefore the left hand is more capable of collecting.
20.13.43	The Ekātrimśa is in front.
20.13.44	Speech is the Ekātrimśaka.
20.13.45	He places speech at the mouth of the sacrifice.
20.13.46	The Brāhmaṇaspatya is the Catuṣṭriṃśa on the right.
20.13.47	This Aditya is the Brāhmaṇaspati.
20.13.48	Brahmavarchas is this Aditya.
20.13.49	He secures Brahmavarchas on the right.
20.13.50	The Trayastrimsa deities are in the rear.
20.13.51	The Trayastrimsa are the deities.
20.13.52	One is established in the deities themselves.
20.13.53	The Nakas are in the north.
20.13.54	The heaven is the Nakas.
20.13.55	In heaven, the sacrificer is established.
21.1.1	He places the Trayastrimsa in the rear, saying, "You are the share of Agni, the lordship of consecration."
21.1.2	Agni is the mouth of the sacrifice.
21.1.3	Initiation is the mouth of sacrifice.
21.1.4	The Trivrt (Stoma) is the mouth of a sacrifice.
21.1.5	He places it in front, the mouth of the sacrificial rite.
21.1.6	You are the share of the wise, the lord of the Dhatri (Stoma). On the right side.
21.1.7	Those who know are the wise.
21.1.8	Food is the Dhatri.
21.1.9	Reproduction is the Saptadasa (Stoma).
21.1.10	He places food on the offspring, on the offspring that have been generated.
21.1.11-18	Therefore, he who is born seeks food. "One is one's own; the other belongs to a friend. The share of Mitra, the lordship of Varuna." "One is the share of Mitra, and the other belongs to Varuna. The share of Indra, the lordship of Vishnu." "One belongs to Indra, and the other to Vishnu. The share of Yama, the lordship of Nirriti." "One (share) belongs to Yama, and the other is Nirriti. The share of Aryaman, the lordship of Bhaga." "One share belongs to Aryaman, and the other share belongs to Bhaga. The share of Pusan, the lordship of Savitr." "One shares belongs to Pusan, and the other shares belongs to Savitr. The share of Sarasvati, the lordship of Sarasvati." "One part belongs to Sarasvati, and the other part belongs to Saraswati. The share of Brhaspati, the lordship of Brhaspati." "One half belongs to Brhaspati, and the other half belongs to Brhspati. The share of the Maruts, the lordship of the Maruts." "One quarter belongs to the Maruts, and the other quarter belongs to the Manuts. The share of Dhruva, the lordship of Dhruva." "One eighth belongs to Dhruva, and the other eighth belongs to Dhuruva. The share of Suniva, the lordship belongs to Suniva." "The share of Suniwa, the lordship belongs Suniwa. The share of Vivasvan, the lordship belongs Vivasvan." "The shares of Vivasvan and of Vivasvan. The share of Sav
21.1.19	Ojas is the fifteenth.
21.1.20	He places Ojas in the north.
21.1.21	Therefore, one who goes forth from the north conquers.
21.1.22	"You are the share of the Vasus, the lordship of the Rudras." In front.
21.1.23	The Vasus are the face of the sacrifice.
21.1.24	The Rudras are the face of sacrifice.
21.1.25	The twenty-fourth is the face of sacrifice
21.1.26	He places the face of sacrifice in front.
21.1.27-34	"Thou art the share of the Adityas, the lordship of the Maruts." On the right side. Food is the Adityas. Food is Maruts. Food is Pañcaviṃśa. He wins food on the right side. "Thou art the portion of Aditi, the lordship of Pūṣan." On the west. Aditi is the foundation. Pūṣan is the foundation.
21.1.35-41	The Pratiṣṭhā (rite) is the Triṇava (rite). For the establishment. "Thou art the share of Savitar, the god, thou art the lordship of Brihaspati," from the north. Brihaspati is indeed Brahman. The Brahman is the Catuṣṭoma. He indeed places Brahman-lustre from the north. It is Savitar-related.
21.1.42	Therefore the Udici (verse) is the gift to Brahmanas.
21.1.43	The Catuṣṭoma is the support. So says the text in front.
21.1.44	The Catusṭoma is the mouth of the sacrifice.
21.1.45	He places the mouth of thesacrifice in front.
21.1.46	This is the share of the barley, the lordship of the barley. So says thetext on the right.
21.1.47	Barley is the months.
21.1.48	Months are food.
21.1.49	He wins food on the right side.
21.1.50	"He wins the share of the Rishis, the lordship of all the gods."
21.1.51	The thirty-three deities.
21.1.52	He stands firm in the deities.
21.1.53	"The Viverta is forty-eight."
21.1.54	Therefore the two hands are equal in strength.
21.1.55	This is the form of Arka.
21.1.56	Food is Arka.
21.1.57	Arka is Agni.
21.1.58	He who knows this, eats food.
21.1.59	He places those which are the chief ones in front.
21.1.60	He who thus knows, becomes chief.
21.1.61	Those which are full of food, he places on the right side.
21.1.62	He who so knows, becomes a food-eater.
21.1.63	Those which are established are in the rear.
21.1.64	He who knows thus goes to the established.
21.1.65	Those which are powerful are in the north.
21.1.66	He who thus knows becomes strong.
21.1.67	He who understands the power of these attains prosperity.
21.2.1	He places the Agni Jāta Prāṇudā Sapatnān in front.
21.2.2	He drives away with it the enemy who has gone before him.
21.2.3	"The "born together" (verses) are at the end."
21.2.4	He drives away with it his enemy who is behind him.
21.2.5	He drives away the superior enemy, he drives away the inferior enemy.
21.2.6	The Stoma of forty-four (verses) is on the right side.
21.2.7	The Stoma is sixteen. From the north.
21.2.8	The sixteen is the thunderbolt.
21.2.9	The thunderbolt is the Tristubh.
21.2.10	The Tristubh is forty-four.
21.2.11	The thunderbolt takes the left and releases the right.
21.2.12	He releases the thunderbolt on his enemy, having driven him away.
21.2.13-19	The Stoma of forty-four is placed on the south. The Stoma of forty four is indeed Brahman-splendour. He thus secures Brahman-splendur on the south. The Stoma of sixteen is placed on the north. The Stoman of sixteen is indeed strength. He thus places strength on the north. Therefore one who goes forth from the north conquers.
21.2.20	"Thou art the excrement of the earth," in the middle.
21.2.21	The excrement is the middle of the self.
21.2.22	He builds the fire with the self.
21.2.23	These are the bricks called "without enemies."
21.2.24	He who, knowing this, places them, has no enemy.
21.2.25	And these are the bricks of Viraj.
21.2.26	He places Viraj as the highest among the animals.
21.2.27	Therefore, one who has cattle speaks the highest speech.
21.2.28	He places ten by ten for the sake of firmness.
21.2.29	The gods going to the heavenly world, their verses which were not recited went to heaven with them.
21.2.30	The sages sought to know them.
21.2.31	They were found with bricks.
21.2.32	These are the metres which are not the carriers of sacrifice.
21.2.33	He who knowing this puts them down, goes to heaven with those metres of the gods which are not specified and which lead to heaven.
21.2.34	Now these are the Stoma Bhagas.
21.2.35	Brihaspati brought these to the sacrifice.
21.2.36	When these are put down, it is for the establishment of the sacrifice.
21.2.37	Brihaspati indeed brought together the brilliance of the sacrifice.
21.2.38	When these are placed, one builds a fire with brilliance.
21.2.39	Prajapati created beings.
21.2.40	He created them with the Stoma-parts.
21.2.41	When these (bricks) are placed, (it is) for procreation.
21.2.42	The sacrifice of the gods was indeed lost on the right side.
21.2.43	They established him with the Stoma-parts.
21.2.44	When these are placed on the right side, facing north, it is for the support of the sacrifice.
21.2.45	He places seven times seven, for the sake of power, three in the middle for support.
21.2.46	Now these are the Nakṣatras.
21.2.47	The gods went to the heavenly world by means of the Nakṣatrathe Nakṣatras,
21.2.48	When these are laid down, it is for conquering the heavenly world.
21.2.49	Or, if he does not go to the world of the gods, he goes to nothing.
21.2.50	The world of the gods is the world of the good.
21.2.51	These are the bricks called all-backs.
21.2.52	Whatever bricks are called backs, whatever is the brilliance of the backs, he obtains that, he who, knowing this, lays them down.
21.2.53	Now these are the five-crested ones.
21.2.54	The wife is the abode of the sacrificer.
21.2.55-60	When he places the five-crested ones in the sky, he establishes the sacrificer in the sky itself. These are the Apsarases. Having assumed this form, they become wives and attend upon the sacrificer in that world. He places one towards the west and east. Therefore the wife attends upon the sacrificer from the west and east.
21.2.61	He who, knowing this, places these (bricks), attains the whole of his life.
21.2.62	These are indeed the heavenly deities.
21.2.63	By means of them alone one goes to the heavenly world.
21.2.64	These are the deities to be invoked.
21.2.65	One should say to him whom one hates, "I place him in your jaws."
21.2.66	He is indeed destroyed by these deities.
21.2.67	He is destroyed by them.
21.3.1-7	"I place you in the seat of Ayus." He places the life-breath in the highest position. Therefore life is the highest of the vital airs. It becomes self-spread for the release of the vital airs and for the attainment of the heavenly world. The horse is Prajapati. When he makes the horse smell, he makes it out of Prajapati. Then this is the diagonal one.
21.3.8	This is indeed the stride of the gods.
21.3.9	By the Vikarni (verse) he makes him stride in the stride of the Gods.
21.3.10	(The verse) containing the word Vayu.
21.3.11	Vayu is indeed the breath.
21.3.12	Ayus is the self-supporting.
21.3.13	He places the life and breath in him in the right order.
21.3.14	When one builds, one kindles him.
21.3.15	One kindles him with the Vayu-verse.
21.3.16	One should build the fire after having served as the chief for a year.
21.3.17	The year is indeed the fire, the all-consuming.
21.3.18	Its days and nights are the bricks.
21.3.19	One should build it with bricks that have been obtained. One prospers.
21.3.20	If one does not build it thus, one would cause one's own body to deteriorate.
21.3.21	If one builds it thus, one causes one's own self to prosper.
21.3.22	The Vaiśvānara is indeed being built up with its own body.
21.3.23	He places the Rtavya bricks; for the securing of the seasons.
21.3.24	He places two-two bricks;
21.3.25	for there are two-two seasons.
21.3.26	He puts four bricks in the middle layer;
21.3.27	The middle layer is like the sky;
21.3.28	The sky is indeed loose.
21.3.29	There are four directions.
21.3.30	He establishes himself in the directions.
21.3.31	The gods created these (verses) from the seasons.
21.3.32	That is why the Rtuvyas are called Rtuvyas.
21.3.33	He who, knowing this, places these (verses), establishes himself in the approaching and approaching season.
21.3.34	They have different beginnings and the same end.
21.3.35	Therefore, in the same year, there are different forms.
21.3.36	Having placed the Avakā, he places the brick.
21.3.37	This is indeed the womb of Agni Vaiśvānara, namely the Avakā.
21.3.38	He places it in its own womb for peace and non-injury.
21.3.39	He prospers who, knowing this, places these (bricks).
21.3.40	Now these are the Viśvajyotiṣa (bricks).
21.3.41	These are indeed the breath-bearers of the sacrificer.
21.3.42	He supports the vital breath with the first, the upward-moving breath with the second, and the downward-moving breath with third.
21.3.43	These are the deities leading to heaven.
21.3.44	By means of them one goes to the heavenly world.
21.3.45	These are indeed the luminous deities.
21.3.46	Fire is his light in this world, wind in the atmosphere, and sun in heaven.
21.3.47	All these worlds of ours become luminous.
21.3.48	They are the ones who have power over.
21.3.49	He goes to power over them.
21.3.50	"He says, "Fill the world, fill the gap."
21.3.51	He fills what is deficient and what is lacking.
21.3.52	"Then he says, "Be firm, be stable," thereby he makes her firm."
21.3.53	Indra-Agni, and Brihaspati, etc. Indra-Agni are strength and vigour.
21.3.54	He builds him with strength and vigour. "
21.3.55	"They are his Sudas and Doha, etc." Therefore, the Sudas is in every place.
21.3.56	"They press Soma, the Priyashni, etc." Priyashni is food.
21.3.57	He obtains food.
21.3.58	In the three shining heavens. The three Savanas.
21.3.59	He builds him in the Savanas.
21.3.60	The Anushtubh is the follower.
21.3.61	The Anustubh is the breath.
21.3.62	Therefore the breath follows all the limbs.
21.3.63	The Anushthubh is speech.
21.3.64	Whatever is not done here, whatever is not stored up, that he imagines with speech, that he heals.
21.4.1	The three Agni-related Gāyatrī verses beginning with "Mūrdhanvatī" are used to place the three eastern quarters.
21.4.2	Then with Tristubh, then with Jagatī, then with Anushtubh, then with Paṅkti, then with whatever Agni-related meter there is.
21.4.3	Three (bricks) with one metre.
21.4.4	Three with one.
21.4.5	He lays down all Agni in succession.
21.4.6	This very altar was made by Yajnasena and Citra.
21.4.7	By it he indeed prospered.
21.4.8	He who, knowing this, lays them down prospers.
21.4.9	The metres are indeed cattle.
21.4.10	The left (side) of the gods.
21.4.11	He seizes the left side of his enemy in the form of cattle.
21.4.12	The Self is the Āhavanīya.
21.4.13	The enemy is the Dhishnya.
21.4.14	If one were to place the Garhapatya, one would give one's own animals to the enemy.
21.4.15	One places the Āhavanīyas.
21.4.16	One gives one's own cattle to oneself.
21.4.17	This is the altar called the Uttaravedi.
21.4.18	Therefore they are placed on the highest altar.
21.4.19	The best of those who know this puts these (bricks) down.
21.4.20	The animal is Agni.
21.4.21	Prajapati created animals with Agni as their leader.
21.4.22	Because there are five layers, animals are called 'paṅkti' (a row).
21.4.23	Because there are three (layers), Agni is threefold.
21.4.24	Because there were two (layers), the sacrificer is biped for stability.
21.4.25	Two syllables for hair.
21.4.26	Two syllables for skin.
21.4.27	Two syllables are for flesh.
21.4.28	Two syllables is for bone.
21.4.29	Two syllables of marrow.
21.4.30	That is ten.
21.4.31	Ten syllables are for Viraj.
21.4.32	Therefore, animals are called Virajas.
21.4.33	He who is knee-high is Gayatri-cit.
21.4.34	He who reaches the navel is Trishtup-cit.
21.4.35	The person who is a man is the universe.
21.4.36	One who desires heaven should make a hawk-shaped bird.
21.4.37	The hawk is the most powerful of birds, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
21.4.38	One who seeks stability should make a bird shaped like an alligator, with four feathers.
21.4.39	There are four directions.
21.4.40	One finds stability in the directions.
21.4.41	One who desires to be in the next world with his head should perform the Kankacita.
21.4.42	He becomes in the next world along with his head.
21.4.43	One who thinks that his enemy has gone ahead of him should perform the Praugacita.
21.4.44	The gods, performing the Praugacit, drove away the Asuras who had gone ahead of them.
21.4.45-49	He who has already passed him in the past, that one he drives away by it. One should perform the Upavasatha rite on both sides if one thinks, "My enemy is behind me." He who is behind him, that one he pushes away by it. He pushes away the superior enemy. He pushes away the inferior one.
21.4.50	One who is performing an attack should make it out of a chariot wheel.
21.4.51	The gods hurled the thunderbolt at the Asuras, saying, "This much of you!"
21.4.52	He strikes his enemy with the thunderbolt.
21.4.53	They drive him away.
21.4.54	One who desires cattle should make it out from a heap of grass.
21.4.55	Cattle are the excrement.
21.4.56	He gathers cattle for him.
21.4.57	He lays down the Uttaravedi on all sides.
21.4.58	The Uttaravedi is indeed the cattle.
21.4.59	He indeed wins cattle.
21.4.60	One who desires to be united with his kinsmen should perform the Paricayya.
21.4.61	The kinsmen indeed enter around.
21.4.62	He indeed unites him with his kinsmen.
21.4.63	One who seeks food should perform the Dronacit.
21.4.64	Food is indeed eaten with a vessel.
21.4.65	He indeed eats food with that mouth.
21.4.66	One who desires to attain the world of the ancestors should perform the funeral rites in a cremation ground.
21.4.67	Yama attained the world beyond by performing the funeral rites in the cremation ground.
21.4.68	One attains the world of the fathers.
21.4.69	One who desires heaven should perform the rites of a bird in the Gayatri form.
21.4.70	Agni, having become a bird, attained the heavenly world.
21.4.71	As it is said, "The Gāyatrī, having become a bird, flew to the heavenly world." For the attainment of the heavenly world.
21.4.72	Other fires are built upward, others downward.
21.4.73	Those built upward are for the heavenly world, those built downward are for this world.
21.4.74	When he sprinkles him standing above with golden scales, he thereby builds him up above for the attainment of the heavenly world.
21.5.1	One should attain Viraj through consecration.
21.5.2	One should be consecrated for three nights.
21.5.3	Viraj has three feet.
21.5.4	One attains Viraj.
21.5.5	One should remain consecrated for six nights.
21.5.6	There are six seasons in a year.
21.5.7-16	Viraj is the year. He attains Viraj. One should be consecrated for ten nights. Viraj has ten syllables. He attains viraj. One who is consecrated for twelve nights. Twelve months are a year. Viraj is the year. He attains Viraj. One who is consecrated for thirteen nights.
21.5.17-25	Thirteen months make a year. The year is Viraj. One attains Viraj. A person should be consecrated for fifteen nights. Fifteen nights make half a month. Half a month is attained by the year. The Year is Viraj. One attains Viraj. A person should be consecrated for twenty-four nights.
21.5.26-34	The year has twenty-four half-months. The year is attained by half-months. The year is Viraj. One attains Viraj. He should be consecrated for a month. What is a month is a year. The year Viraj.  One attains Viraj. He should be consecrated for four months.
21.5.35	The Vasus, four in number, were afraid of him.
21.5.36	They conquered the earth and the Gāyatrī metre.
21.5.37	The Rudras, eight in number,
21.5.38	They conquered the atmosphere and the Tristubh metre.
21.5.39	The Adityas, twelve in number,
21.5.40	Conquered heaven and the Jagatī metre.
21.5.41	Then they went away, having obtained the pre-eminence among the gods.
21.5.42	Therefore one should build the fire after twelve months.
21.5.43	Twelve months make a year.
21.5.44	The year is Agni Vaiśvānara.
21.5.45	Its days and nights are the bricks.
21.5.46	He builds him with the bricks obtained.
21.5.47	He prospers.
21.5.48	He goes to the most prominent position among his equals.
21.5.49	He chants the Gāyatrī verse in front.
21.5.50-58	The Gâyatra is the head of the gods. Agni is Gâyatra. Therefore he sings the Gâyatra first. In the Agni-Pâvamânî. This indeed is the breath that blows, it is the breath. Agni, the mouth of the gods. He places the breath in the mouth. Therefore the breath is in the mouth. The Rathantara is sung northwards, the Brihat southwards.
21.5.59	He places the two (verses) of the same kind together.
21.5.60	This (earth) is the Rathantara, that (sky) is the Brihat.
21.5.61	He thus encloses him with these two.
21.5.62	He sings the Yagyayajniya on the tail, the Vamadevya on the hips.
21.5.63	The Yagyayajniyam is the self.
21.5.64	The Vamadevya is the body.
21.5.65	He thus builds him with self and body.
21.5.66	The heart is in the armpit,
21.5.67	Therefore, the heart is not in the hollow.
21.5.68	Therefore, the heart is without a fixed abode.
21.5.69	He recites the Arka hymns.
21.5.70	Agni is indeed the sun.
21.5.71	He recitess the Arka hymns for peace.
21.6.1	The year is indeed between darkness and the heavenly world.
21.6.2	These thousand bricks are luminous.
21.6.3	When he sprinkles with gold and shells, he makes him (Agni) dwell for a year in the light.
21.6.4	"You are the measure of a thousand."
21.6.5	"You are a measure of a thousand."
21.6.6	These worlds are measured by a thousand.
21.6.7	They destroy Agni here, when it is not done here, when it does not get piled up.
21.6.8	Gold is immortal.
21.6.9	When he sprinkles with gold and shells, he nourishes his body with nectar.
21.6.10	"He makes them into cows by saying, "May these bricks of mine be cows for you, O Agni."
21.6.11	They stand by him in the other world, giving what is desired.
21.6.12	The gods divided the sacrifices among Rudra.
21.6.13	He approached the gods with a long stride.
21.6.14	The gods saw this (rite) of a hundred Rudras.
21.6.15	With it they appeased him.
21.6.16	When he offers the rite of a hundred Rudra, he appeases him with it.
21.6.17	He offers first at the knee.
21.6.18	He appeases Rudra from this (world).
21.6.19	Then at the navel.
21.6.20	He appeasess Rudra from the atmosphere.
21.6.21	Then at the height of a man.
21.6.22	He offers to Rudra in the same place.
21.6.23	He offers to Rudra above this place.
21.6.24	Then at the height of a man.
21.6.25	Then at navel-height.
21.6.26	Then at knee-height.
21.6.27	He offers Rudra facing this way.
21.6.28	It becomes six.
21.6.29	There are six seasons.
21.6.30	He offers the Rudra to the seasons.
21.6.31	Or he offers with the seeds of Gavidhuka, or with barley, or with the oil of Kusayasa, or with the milk of a deer.
21.6.32	If he offers with the domestic (material), he makes Rudra wander in the village.
21.6.33	With the wild (material) he propitiates the wild Rudra.
21.6.34	He offers with the leaves of Arka.
21.6.35	Arka is Agni.
21.6.36-41	He offers it on the last brick of the northern half. This is the direction of Rudra. Having driven away Rudra from his own direction, he offers. Agni is an animal. Now when he is being built, he is born.
21.6.42	Just as a calf, when born, seeks the teat, so now he seeks his share.
21.6.43	He thinks of the sacrificer and the Adhvaryu.
21.6.44	When he offers the Satarudriya, he appeases him with his share.
21.6.45	The Angirasas were going to the heavenly world. They poured down the heat on the goat.
21.6.46	She, lamenting, touched a leaf.
21.6.47	He became the Sun.
21.6.48	That is the reason why it is called Arka.
21.6.49	When one offers with the Arka leaf, it is for the sake of having offspring.
21.6.50	One should place the animals of the one whom one hates in the path of the Sun.
21.6.51	The animals that first come to the Sun are afflicted.
21.6.52	The animals which come last should be made to recite the Yajus.
21.6.53	These are the deities leading to heaven.
21.6.54	By means of them alone he goes to the heavenly world.
21.6.55	These are the deities to be invoked.
21.6.56	One who hates him should say, "I place him in your jaws."
21.6.57	He thus invokes him to these deities.
21.6.58	He then shoots him.
21.7.1	"The one who is resting on the mountain of strength, on the stone," he sprinkles with water.
21.7.2-6	The water is indeed the essence of Prajapati. He thus satisfies him with the essence of Prajapatl. He, being satisfied and pleased, stands by him without hunger. "He sprinkles three times, saying, 'O stone, may thy hunger reach him whom we hate.' He thus causes hunger and grief to him whom he hates.
21.7.7	These are the three worlds.
21.7.8	He pacifies him from these worlds.
21.7.9	He goes around three times sprinkling again.
21.7.10	That makes six.
21.7.11	There are six seasons.
21.7.12	He pacifiies him from the seasons.
21.7.13	If he were to practice sorcery, he should go around three times sprinkling and then sprinkle on the right hip.
21.7.14	"This one I am casting out against so-and-so, the son of so-and- so."
21.7.15	Taking the ash from the fire, he throws it at him.
21.7.16	He suffers misfortune when he is being split.
21.7.17	When he takes the name, he cuts off his root.
21.7.18	This is a pile of Varuna's noose.
21.7.19	He pulls it with a frog.
21.7.20	The life of a frog passes.
21.7.21	He does not harm domestic animals or wild animals.
21.7.22	Therefore, he approaches it in spring and rainy season.
21.7.23	For this is the season of grief.
21.7.24	He pulls with an Avaka plant and a Vetasa branch.
21.7.25	The Avaka is the arrow of water, the Vetasa is the prosperity of water.
21.7.26	The waters are peaceful.
21.7.27	He appeases his impurity with the peaceful ones.
21.7.28	With three (verses).
21.7.29	Agni is threefold.
21.7.30	He appeases the impurity of Agni, whatever its extent.
21.7.31	Prajapati created beings.
21.7.32	They became hungry.
21.7.33	He gave them food.
21.7.34	They said, "It was not enough for us."
21.7.35	Food is purifying.
21.7.36	Those which are the most fiery, they are for food.
21.7.37	Which Agni is for us to worship?
21.7.38	He draws with seven (sticks).
21.7.39	There are seven metres.
21.7.40	With the metres he appeases his impurity.
21.7.41	He draws with eight (sticks).
21.7.42	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
21.7.43	Agni is Gayatri.
21.7.44	As much as the fire, so much does it pacify the impurity.
21.7.45	He places it on the heap of ashes.
21.7.46	This is her purity.
21.7.47	He places purity on her.
21.7.48	If one hates someone, one should place it on him.
21.7.49	He gives him purity.
21.7.50	He puts five gold flakes in the five-fold taken ghee.
21.7.51	Gold is brilliance.
21.7.52-58	The ghee is for life. He offers it with the verse, "May the ghee be for life." Then he offers the oblation to Agni with the verse, “May the oblation be for life." He offers it with the same verse. He advances with the verse, "Salutations to your radiance, O Agni." For one advances towards the superior after paying homage. He offers with the verse, "May the oblation not be exhausted." For the sake of non-exhaustion. He offers the oblation with the verse,"O Agni, may the oblation be offered to you." For the oblation to be offered to Agni. He offers to Agni with the verses,"O Agni who are the lord of oblations, may the oblations be offered to you. O Agni, may we offer the oblations to you." He offers to Agni with these verses. He offers in the fire with the verse,"
21.7.59	The gods who are offered and those who are not offered.
21.7.60	By offering to Agni, one obtains both of them.
21.7.61	What one offers and what one pours out, one pleases and obtains them.
21.7.62	Both of them are pleased with his sacrifice.
21.7.63	One pours out with a ladle.
21.7.64	It is the most suitable for Prajapati.
21.7.65-71	Therefore, it is not offered nor not offered. He makes the sandals of black antelope skin. This is the form of Brahman, namely, the black antelope skin. Death is Agni. By means of Brahman, he conceals death. He conceals death. He should make one of the two sandals of black antelope hide. He should make one of them of the other food.
21.7.72	He places it within the death.
21.7.73	He secures food.
21.7.74	One who builds a fire is deprived of his life and cattle.
21.7.75	The first one approaches him.
21.7.76	"He says, "You are the giver of life, you are the giver of breath," thus he makes him complete with life."
21.7.77	"He says "You are the Giver of Light, you are the Giver of Wealth," offspring is light,
21.7.78	cattle is wealth."
21.7.79	And by offspring and cattle he prospers him.
21.7.80	He descends with the words, "The giver of life, the giver of breath."
21.7.81	By his form.
21.7.82	With two.
21.7.83	The sacrificer has two feet for stability.
21.8.1	Indra indeed slew Vritra.
21.8.2	He struck him with sixteen strokes with his thunderbolt.
21.8.3	He burns away the sins and their enjoyments by Agni, and is freed from sins by the two (Agni and Vaisvānara).
21.8.4	When he offers with the Agniya (verse), he burns away the sins with Agni, and is released from sins by the (Agni and) Vaisvānaran (verses).
21.8.5	If one desires, one should offer with each (verse),
21.8.6	"May I be released from sin for a long time."
21.8.7-13	He is freed from sin for a long time. If one wishes, one should offer all the oblations together at the end, saying, "May I be freed from sin." One is freed from sin. It becomes sixteen. The person has sixteen parts. He is freed from sin as much as his own self is.
21.8.14-20	Then he cuts it with sixteen (pieces) and a knife. He offers with two different Sūktas. For the different power of the two Sūktas. He puts in the kindling woods. He puts in the share of Agni. Just as one who is going to a village makes a shelter, so here the hospitality to Agni is done. He puts three (kindling woods).
21.8.21	Agni is three-fold.
21.8.22	He performs hospitality as much as Agni is.
21.8.23	They are made of Udumbara wood.
21.8.24	Udumbara is energy.
21.8.25	He bestows energy on him.
21.8.26	He anoints with ghee.
21.8.27	This is Agni's beloved abode, namely ghee.
21.8.28	He performs the hospitality as his beloved abode.
21.8.29	"The All-Gods have raised thee up."
21.8.30	The All-Gods are the breaths.
21.8.31	He raises him up with the breaths.
21.8.32	The All-gods are men.
21.8.33	He raises up him with men.
21.8.34	"May men raise thee up with their thoughts."
21.8.35	He raises him with the thought for which he is being raised.
21.8.36	The five directions are the directions themselves. He directs him towards them.
21.8.37	Two (verses) are taken up, for the removal of the Rākṣasas.
21.8.38	"Harikeśa, sūryarasmi" (the Savitri verse) is for the sake of progeny.
21.8.39	"The gods, the Adhvaryus, stood among the gods" (the Savitar verse) is for prosperity.
21.8.40	This is indeed the milking of blessings.
21.8.41	"This is indeed the heaven" (the Savitari verse) is for heaven.
21.8.42	This is the heaven of the heavenly world.
21.8.43	Uksha, the ocean, Arun, the golden-winged one.
21.8.44	He places the stone in the Agnidhra chamber.
21.8.45	The space between heaven and earth is indeed like something without a foundation, without a support.
21.8.46	The Agnidhra chamber is space.
21.8.47	When he places it in the Agnidhrā chamber,
21.8.48	he makes it a support.
21.8.49	"He places it with the verse, "Prsni is placed in the middle of heaven,"
21.8.50	Prsni is food.
21.8.51	He obtains food.
21.8.52	He settles with two (verses).
21.8.53	The sacrificer has two feet; for stability.
21.8.54	They go from the Āgnīdhra with six (verses).
21.8.55	There are six seasons.
21.8.56	It is indeed by the seasons.
21.8.57	With four (verses) up to the tail.
21.8.58	There are four metres.
21.8.59	It is by the metres.
21.8.60	(He says) 'Indra'.
21.8.61	He wins the sense-organ.
21.8.62	"He grows,"
21.8.63	he attains growth.
21.8.64	" "The Vājas (are)
21.8.65	food."
21.8.66	He wins food.
21.8.67	They proceed with the Anushtubh (verse) addressed to the All-gods.
21.8.68	The Anushtubh is speech.
21.8.69	Speech is addressed to the All gods.
21.8.70	It has all forms,
21.8.71	All forms are offered in the fire.
21.8.72	Therefore, they go with this (verse).
21.8.73	"O Agni, do thou come to us with thy good grace."
21.8.74	Sacrifice is good grace.
21.8.75	He indeed wins the sacrifice.
21.8.76	"O Agni! I have seized thee with the impulse of the steed, with the grasping."
21.8.77	Brahma is the grasping.
21.8.78	Brahma is grasping.
21.8.79	This is the sun rising, the Udgṛhīta.
21.8.80	This is the sun setting, the Nigrāhita.
21.8.81	One seizes oneself with Brahman.
21.8.82	One seizers one's enemy with Brahman.
21.8.83	Then one says, "May Indra and Agni separate my enemies who are far away."
21.8.84	Indra and Agni are strength and energy.
21.8.85	By his own strength and energy, he pushes away his enemies.
21.9.1	"Go in order with Agni to heaven."
21.9.2	It is the ascent to the world of heaven.
21.9.3	"Go, knowing, to the eastern direction."
21.9.4	He turns towards the world of the gods.
21.9.5	"All directions shine, illuminating."
21.9.6	Therefore Agni shines in all directions.
21.9.7	I ascend from the earth to the sky, from the sky to heaven.
21.9.8	These are the ways of these worlds.
21.9.9	They reach the heaven without depending on others.
21.9.10	For the attainment of the heavenly world.
21.9.11	O Agni, go first, stretching out to the gods.
21.9.12	He places the eye among the gods and among men.
21.9.13	"The Bhrigus, the gods, are seeking him, in unison."
21.9.14	He sends him to the heavenly world.
21.9.15	He advances with five (verses).
21.9.16	Agni is fivefold.
21.9.17	He advances, having paid homage to Agni as much as he is.
21.9.18	"O Agni, with the thousand eyes, O Night and Dawn."
21.9.19	He offers with the two (verses) of the Samhita.
21.9.20	He unites the day and night.
21.9.21	Therefore, when the day and night are joined together.
21.9.22	He offers to the black cow with a white calf.
21.9.23	He gives him the night by day.
21.9.24	Cattle are of different forms, of different vows.
21.9.25	They made this very form of cattle.
21.9.26	He offers with milk.
21.9.27	The cattle stand near him, knowing this very thing.
21.9.28-35	He offers in the Svayamatrinna pot with curds. Svayamatrinna is this (earth). Curds is food. He places food in this (earth). Therefore, they live on food from here onwards. "He says, "You are Suparna, the Golden-hued." He places it with the Gayatri verse." He places it on this (earth).
21.9.36	He fills the space with light.
21.9.37	With a Tristubh verse.
21.9.38	He makes him step on the space.
21.9.39	"He who offers, the well-directed, in front."
21.9.40	With a Jagati verse.
21.9.41	He causes him to step on the sky.
21.9.42	Having united him with these deities, he establishes him.
21.9.43	With three (verses).
21.9.44	Agni is threefold.
21.9.45	He makes it reach as far as the fire extends.
21.9.46	"He places it with the formula, "This is Savitri's."
21.9.47	He places it with Savitri's formula for prosperity.
21.9.48	The Udumbara wood.
21.9.49	Udumbara is energy.
21.9.50	He places energy in him.
21.9.51	The fire indeed yields to the fire-kindler, the fire-kindled yields to the fire.
21.9.52	Kanva, indeed, knew the milking of this (cow) of straw.
21.9.53	Just as one milks a cow that has been milked, so one milks Agni with this (cow) that is milked.
21.9.54	"We wish to Agni, the prosperous one."
21.9.55	The Vikaṅkatī (verse).
21.9.56	When Agni was created, the radiance of Vikaṅkata reached him.
21.9.57	He indeed obtains that (radiance).
21.9.58	"Agni, the kindled one, shines in front of us."
21.9.59	made of the śamī tree, for peace.
21.9.60	Virāj.
21.9.61	This is the Soma-cow with the ear-guard.
21.9.62	Somadatta Kauśreya, the sacrificer, asked this of the sacrificers:
21.9.63	"Do you know the Soma-cow, with the ear-guards?"
21.9.64	"We know her as she is in the forest."
21.9.65	The ear of this is indeed cattle.
21.9.66	One obtains cattle.
21.9.67	The gods, indeed, hurled the thunderbolt, the hundred-killer, against the Asuras, saying, "Against so many of you."
21.9.68	He strikes his foe with the thunderbolt.
21.9.69	He makes him fall down.
21.9.70	"Seven are thy kindling-sticks, O Agni,"
21.9.71	he thus delights him with the sapta-kindling-sticks.
21.9.72	He offers with a full ladle.
21.9.73	Just as a mother would give milk to her calf, so does he give him his share.
21.9.74	He offers with curds in front.
21.9.75	With ghee above.
21.9.76	Curds is energy.
21.9.77	Ghee is brilliance.
21.9.78	He places energy and brilliance in the upper part of him.
21.9.79	And he also gives him these two.
21.10.1	Now this is the chariot that cannot be conquered.
21.10.2	By means of this the gods conquered the Asuras.
21.10.3	That is why it is called the chariot that cannot he conquered.
21.10.4	One conquers one's enemy by means of this.
21.10.5	This is the Gayatri with the luminous wings.
21.10.6	By means means of this one goes to heaven.
21.10.7	It consists of ten verses.
21.10.8	The Viraj has ten syllables.
21.10.9	The Virai is food.
21.10.10	He stands firm in the food of Viraj.
21.10.11	By this very (rite) Bharadvaja used to go to Prati-dan.
21.10.12	Then indeed he (Bharadvaja) became a king.
21.10.13	He whom one desires to be a king, one should go to him with this (rite).
21.10.14	He indeed becomes a king.
21.10.15	This is the oblation called 'the moving of the world'.
21.10.16	By this (rite) he drives away his enemy from his own place.
21.10.17	One should perform it in a battle.
21.10.18	The fire-pit should be made of clay or of wood.
21.10.19	If the embers spread, the enemy's army spreads.
21.10.20	Then to Agni Vaiśvānara, twelve pot-fulls (of oblations).
21.10.21	Agni Vaiśvānāra is the year.
21.10.22	This is the dear body of the year, which is Vaiśvānara.
21.10.23	When he offers hospitality to Agni Vaiśvānari, it is indeed his dear body.
21.10.24	Vaiśvānara is the nobility.
21.10.25	The Maruts are the people.
21.10.26	When the Maruts are invoked after Vaiśvānaran,
21.10.27	he indeed unites the people with the nobility.
21.10.28	He offers to Vaiśvānāra loudly.
21.10.29	He offers to the Maruts in a low voice.
21.10.30	Therefore the Kshatriya class surpasses the Vaishya class.
21.10.31	The animal is Agni.
21.10.32	Prajapati created animals with Agni as their leader.
21.10.33	The animals are the Maruts.
21.10.34	When the Maruts are invoked after Vaishvanara, it is for the propagation of animals.
21.10.35	If one were to turn towards the east, one would be confused with the divine classes.
21.10.36	If the Dakshina is to be offered to the Pitrs, it should be offered to the east.
21.10.37	If it is to be offered for the Rakshas, it should be to the west.
21.10.38	If it should be offered for the Manes, it should be in the north.
21.10.39	The Homa should be performed in a straight line for the establishment of the sacrificer.
21.10.40	Now these are the Maruts.
21.10.41	Seven Kapalas each.
21.10.42	Because the Maruts are seven and the groups are sevenfold.
21.10.43	One should offer after running with each group.
21.10.44	The Maruts are indeed a group, and he satisfies them as a group.
21.10.45	The group of hymns in the forest, he offers in the middle.
21.10.46	The Maruts are indeed the nobility, and the others are the people.
21.10.47	He makes the people the middlemost of the nobility.
21.10.48	If one wishes, "May I destroy the nobility with the people," he should confuse the group of hymns in forest with the others.
21.10.49	The people destroy the nobility.
21.10.50	If one desires, "May I destroy the people with the nobility," one should perform the Yagya and Anuvakya in the Tristubh meter.
21.10.51	The Tristubh meter is indeed strength and energy.
21.10.52	One takes away the strength and energy of the people and bestows it on the nobility.
21.10.53	If one desires, "I may drive out the nobility," one may drive away the chariot-drawn sacrificial post from the fire with the Anuvakya chant in the forest.
21.10.54-59	This indeed is the royal power of the king. It is the royal power itself of the Maruts. He drives him away with royal power from the royal power. The divine hosts of Indra follow the Maruts. This indeed is the path of the gods. He makes the path of the sacrificer follow the path of the Gods.
21.10.60	He who builds (the fire-altar) is indeed offering to it.
21.10.61	He illuminates it with the names of Maruts.
21.11.1	He offers a stream of ghee.
21.11.2	"He offers with the verse, "May I be a stream of ghee."
21.11.3	This is indeed offered.
21.11.4	This stream of ghee indeed stands by the sacrificer in the other world.
21.11.5	He offers continuously for the continuity of food and for non-interruption.
21.11.6	He should offer it to the one whom he hates.
21.11.7	He cuts off his food.
21.11.8	He offers with ghee.
21.11.9	Ghee is radiance.
21.11.10	The stream of ghee is radiance.
21.11.11	He places radiance in radiance.
21.11.12	This is offered for the establishment of the unequipped, for the binding of the unbound, for the conquest of the unconquered.
21.11.13	The breath and the out-breath.
21.11.14	He places the Prāṇāpāna (winds) in the sacrificer.
21.11.15	Food and sight.
21.11.16	This is the form of food.
21.11.17	He wins food by means of its form.
21.11.18	He offers twelve oblations.
21.11.19	Twelve months are a year.
21.11.20	He wins the food of the year.
21.11.21	Fire and water.
21.11.22	This is indeed the source of food.
21.11.23	He obtains food with its source.
21.11.24	He offers half of the Indra-offerings.
21.11.25	For the attainment of the deities.
21.11.26	When he offers half of the Indras,
21.11.27	Therefore Indra is the most favored among the deities.
21.11.28	He makes Indra the last.
21.11.29	He establishes the sacrificer in the power.
21.11.30	The rays and the light
21.11.31-38	The mouth of the sacrifice is the rays and the rays. He indeed obtains the mouth of the sacrifice. The ladles and the cups. These are indeed the forms of the sacrifice. He indeed obtains the sacrifice by means of the forms. The Avabhrtha and the Svagakara, for stability. Agni and the Gharma, for brahminical splendour. This is indeed the brahminical splendour of Agni.
21.11.39	He thus obtains the same.
21.11.40	"Three-fold and three-fold" (is the formula).
21.11.41	There are so many stages of animals.
21.11.42	He thus obtains animals of the same stage.
21.11.43	"One and three" (is the mantra).
21.11.44	"One and Three" is the human desire.
21.11.45	He thus attains the human desire. "Four and eight" (is the
21.11.46	formula).
21.11.47-54	The four and eight are the same as the divine desire. One obtains the divine desire. The two and three are the same as one and two. The two and three are one and two. The two and four are the same as two and four. The two, three, and four are the two, three, four, and five. The two, three, five, and six are the two, four, six, and eight. The two are the same as four. The two, four, and eight are the two, six, and ten. The two-and-a-half and three-and-a half are the same as three and four. One generates with the two-and-three-and-a quarter. One and three. One offers up to thirty-three. The thirty-three deities.
21.11.55	He wins the gods.
21.11.56	Four and eight.
21.11.57	Forty-eight.
21.11.58	The Jagati has forty-eight syllables.
21.11.59	Cattle are Jagatis.
21.11.60	He wins cattle.
21.11.61	He prospers in this world with the human metre,
21.11.62	in the other world with the divine metre.
21.11.63	He conquers both worlds.
21.11.64	Vājas and Prasavas.
21.11.65	These are the thirteen Vyāhrtis.
21.11.66	The year has thirteen months.
21.11.67	He grows to the end of the year.
21.11.68	May life be accomplished by sacrifice.
21.11.69	This is the accomplishment of the sacrifice.
21.11.70	Rks and Sāmans.
21.11.71	The stream of Soma is indeed food.
21.11.72	Having bound the stream of food with the stream of food, he becomes the giver of food.
21.11.73	Stoma and Yajus.
21.11.74	Stoma is indeed the divine kingdom, and Yajus is the divine kingdom.
21.11.75	He bestows the divine kingdom at the very end.
21.12.1	The gods fought a race for the Vaja-prasava.
21.12.2	Agni won it.
21.12.3	When one offers the Vaja-prasuva, it is for the winning of food.
21.12.4	He offers on every kind of food.
21.12.5	He obtains all kinds of food.
21.12.6	If he does not offer on a particular kind of food, he is deprived of it.
21.12.7	If he is not going to offer on a particular food, he should sprinkle it on the fire.
21.12.8	He obtains it by that.
21.12.9	He offers with a spoon made of Udumbara wood.
21.12.10	Udumbara is energy.
21.12.11	He obtains food by energy.
21.12.12-19	This is the consecration of Agni. Therefore, when it rains, one should not run. If one runs, one runs away from food. These are the National Supporters. This is the Agni that is being built up, the Kshatra (warrior caste) among the Agnis. These support his kingdom. That is why they are called National Supporters.
21.12.20	He gives him the kingdom with the same (bricks).
21.12.21	They are six.
21.12.22	There are six seasons.
21.12.23	He gives him the kingdom by means of the seasons.
21.12.24	And he stands firm in the seasons.
21.12.25	The oblations are in pairs for propagation.
21.12.26	They are twelve.
21.12.27	There are twelve months in a year.
21.12.28	He gives the kingdom to him by means of the year.
21.12.29	Then indeed he stands firm in the year itself.
21.12.30	He offers on the thirteenth day at the Rathamukha.
21.12.31	The chariot is indeed the thunderbolt.
21.12.32	By means of the thunderbolt he conquers the directions.
21.12.33	Having conquered those directions, he proceeds by chariot.
21.12.34	He offers the Vātahoma.
21.12.35	He indeed wins the wind.
21.12.36	He indeed is being worshipped by the fire-kindled one in this world.
21.12.37	He offers three times.
21.12.38	These are the three worlds.
21.12.39	He wins the wind from these worlds.
21.12.40	These worlds blow the wind for him.
21.12.41	He offers with a joined pair of hands.
21.12.42	The wind is the offering of the hands.
21.12.43	One should not offer the wind with offerings.
21.12.44	He obtains it only by one (offering).
21.12.45	"He says, 'You are the ocean, the shining one.'
21.12.46	These are indeed the forms of the wind.
21.12.47	One binds the wind with forms.
21.12.48	The breath is indeed the Gāyatrī.
21.12.49	The Gāyatrī is the Havirdhāna.
21.12.50	The Vyāna is the Tristubh.
21.12.51	The Tristubh is the Agnidhra.
21.12.52	The Apāna is the Jagatī.
21.12.53	The Jagatī is the Sadas.
21.12.54	"He is placed in the middle of heaven, the speckled stone."
21.12.55	Indeed, he is the Asura, the speckled stone.
21.12.56	He thus places the breath and out-breath in the Soma.
21.12.57	For the support of the breath and outbreath.
21.12.58	He places twenty-one in the Hotri-cup.
21.12.59	The twenty-one is the support of the Stoma-s; for support.
21.12.60	Eleven in the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsa.
21.12.61	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
21.12.62	The Tristup is power.
21.12.63	He thus wins power.
21.12.64	Eight in the others.
21.12.65	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
21.12.66	One indeed stands firm in the Gayatri.
21.12.67	Six for the Marjalis.
21.12.68	There are six seasons.
21.12.69	The seasons have taken away this (oblation) to the south.
21.12.70	The fathers are the seasons.
21.12.71	Therefore, six are placed here.
22.1.1	The divine chariot is yoked for the heavenly world.
22.1.2	The human chariot is for desire.
22.1.3	"I yoke Agni with strength and ghee."
22.1.4	He yokes the chariot of the gods.
22.1.5	The yoked one carries him to heaven.
22.1.6	If he were to yoke with all (verses), Agni would be yoked to him.
22.1.7	The oblations would be without a support.
22.1.8	He yokes with three (verses).
22.1.9	Agni is threefold.
22.1.10	He yoked Agni as much as he is.
22.1.11-15	When that is done, the sacrifice is completed. With two (verses) he does not offer the oblations, for the establishment of the oblations. With two verses he touches the Stotra of the Yajñāyajñiya. This much is the sacrifice, as much as the Agniṣṭoma. The earth is yours, the sky is yours, the heaven is yours, the space is yours, the quarters are yours, the directions are yours, the world is yours, the world of heaven is yours, this world is yours, this is yours, this belongs to you, this is yours. This is done for you.
22.1.16	As far as the sacrifice extends, as far as the Agniṣṭoma extends, so far he ascends to heaven.
22.1.17	Indeed, these two fires, the Agniṣṭomah and the Vaiśvānara, are indeed burning.
22.1.18	He touches with two verses containing the word "peace" for peace.
22.1.19	With two verses.
22.1.20	The sacrificer has two feet for stability.
22.1.21	"May the seasons increase thee, O Agni, in accordance with the Rta."
22.1.22	He makes the seasons grow with the Sama hymns.
22.1.23	With the seasons, the year.
22.1.24	"He shines with the divine light."
22.1.25	Therefore Agni shines in all directions.
22.1.26	"The Asvins have taken away death from him."
22.1.27	One should do this for one who is afflicted with disease.
22.1.28	He removes death from him.
22.1.29	"We have risen above darkness."
22.1.30	sin is darkness.
22.1.31	He thus removes sin.
22.1.32	"He sees the light, the supreme."
22.1.33	The supreme light is the sun.
22.1.34	He attains union with the sun.
22.1.35	One should perform those which are not auspicious for peace.
22.1.36	Twenty-four.
22.1.37	The half-months of the year are twenty-four.
22.1.38-45	The year does not stand, nor does its glory stand, for him for whom these are performed. Now these are the Apryas. Prajapati, having created the creatures, was as if dissatisfied. He saw these Apryas. With them he satisfied himself. The sacrifice is Prajapati. When one becomes Apryas, One satisfies the sacrifice.
22.1.46	The (bricks) are deficient and excessive.
22.1.47	The (bricks) in pairs are for the sake of propagation.
22.1.48	This is the name of the metre of Prajapati, namely, Lomasha.
22.1.49	Animals are born with hair; for the sake of the propagation of animals.
22.1.50	All these are forms.
22.1.51	All forms are made in the fire-altar.
22.1.52	Therefore they are in the fire-altars.
22.2.1	Just as the re-installation of the fire, so is the re-installation.
22.2.2	One who does not prosper by the installation of the fire, he installs it again.
22.2.3	If one does not prosper by building the fire, one should build it again.
22.2.4	One prospers.
22.2.5	The first layer is the self.
22.2.6	The second layer is the offspring.
22.2.7	The third layer is the cattle.
22.2.8	One who is building the third fire should place these bricks on the middle layer for continuity.
22.2.9	This Agni is called Napāt.
22.2.10	One who knows this and places these (bricks) eats food.
22.2.11	He places eight (bricks).
22.2.12	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
22.2.13	He indeed stands firm in the Gayatri.
22.2.14	The oblation that is offered in the Agni-cīci-fire flows away.
22.2.15	The sacrifice follows that which flows away.
22.2.16	(The sacrifice) follows the sacrificer.
22.2.17	These are placed for the establishment of the oblations.
22.2.18	The sacrifice then follows those which have been established.
22.2.19	(The sacrificer) follows the sacrifice.
22.2.20	He places eight of them.
22.2.21-28	The Gayatri has eight syllables. Agni is Gayatri. He builds him as big as Agni. Having placed eight (bricks) he covers them with clay. The Gayatri has eight (syllables). Brahma is Gayatri. He builds him with Brahma. Having placed eleven Lokamprana bricks with the Gayatri metre, he covers them with earth.
22.2.29	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
22.2.30	The Tristubh is energy.
22.2.31	He builds him with energy.
22.2.32	Having placed the twelve Lokamprana bricks with the Tristubh metre, he covers them with the earth.
22.2.33	The Jagati has twelve syllables.
22.2.34	The animals are Jagati.
22.2.35	He builds them with animals.
22.2.36	With the Jagati metre, there are three layers and three earth.
22.2.37	That makes six.
22.2.38	There are six seasons.
22.2.39	He establishes himself in the seasons.
22.2.40	They say, "This is indeed the northern altar. If his fire were to be built here first, he should perform the sacrifice after approaching it."
22.2.41	Just as one adds more to a burning fire, so he places that superior brilliance in him.
22.2.42	They say, "Who is worthy to awaken the sleeping one?"
22.2.43	By offering oblations, he nourishes him.
22.2.44	When one builds a fire altar, one is creating a house.
22.2.45	Whatever one obtains from elsewhere, one brings it to the house.
22.2.46	If one were to sacrifice with the desire, if with an animal, if with Soma, then one should sacrifice after having approached the fire that was previously laid down for him.
22.2.47	Just as one brings home wealth from elsewhere, so does one do this.
22.3.1	Having performed the Ukhā sacrifice for a year, in the second year, he should offer an oblation of eight potfuls to Agni, eleven potfuls to Indra, twelve potfuls to Viśve Devās, rice-gruel to Brhaspati, three potfuls to Viṣṇu. In the third year, having performed the Pariyajña sacrifice, one should perform the Abhijit sacrifice.
22.3.2	The oblation of eight pots is because the Gāyatrī metre has eight syllables.
22.3.3	The morning pressing is Agni's, in the Gayatri metre.
22.3.4	He thus established the morning pressing and the Gayatri metre in it.
22.3.5	Because it has eleven potsherds, the Tristubh metre has eleven syllables.
22.3.6	The midday pressing is Indra's, in Tristubh metre.
22.3.7	He established the midday pressing and the Tristubh in it.
22.3.8	The potsherds are twelve, the Jagati metre has twelve syllables.
22.3.9	The Visvadevya is the third pressing.
22.3.10	He thus supports the Jagati metre.
22.3.11	What is dedicated to Brhaspati, Brhaspati is Brahman.
22.3.12	He thus supported Brahman.
22.3.13	What is for Vishnu, Vishnu is sacrifice.
22.3.14	He thus upholds the sacrifice.
22.3.15	What is offered in the Abhijit (pressing), it is for victory.
22.3.16	What is the Ukhya (vessel) that is kept for a year,
22.3.17	He thereby touches this world.
22.3.18	What he sews as the second,
22.3.19	He thereby touches the atmosphere.
22.3.20	What he offers, he thereby touches that world.
22.3.21	Parāṅnāra, Kākṣīvāna, Auśija, Trasadasyu, Paurakutsas, desiring offspring, sewed it.
22.3.22	Then they obtained a thousand sons.
22.3.23	He goes to the very place where they went, he who knowing thus builds it.
22.4.1	Prajapati first built this Agni with the seasons. He dwelt in the spring in the eastern half, in the summer in the southern half, in the rains in the northern half, in the autumn in the tail, in the winter in the middle.
22.4.2	Brahma indeed fashioned his forepart.
22.4.3	The right wing with Kshatra, the left with the people, the tail with cattle, and the middle with the vital airs.
22.4.4	This is all that there is.
22.4.5	He touches what there is.
22.4.6	They listen to him who is about to make the fire; he eats food and shines.
22.4.7-12	What is the first layer? What is the excrement? The Brahmins say. This very one is the first layer, plants are the excrement. The second layer is the intermediate space, animals are the excrement The third layer is the sky, the stars are the excrement, The fourth layer is the sacrifice, the Dakshina is the excrement, the fifth layer is the self, the progeny is the excrement.
22.4.13	If one were to build a three-layered altar, one would obstruct the sacrifice, the sacrificial fee, oneself, and offspring.
22.4.14	Therefore, it should be built with five layers.
22.4.15	If there are three layers, Agni is threefold.
22.4.16	If there is one, the sacrificer is bipedal.
22.4.17	These are the three worlds.
22.4.18	One prospers in these worlds.
22.6.1	The year with its seasons is the same.
22.6.2	The year is the year.
22.6.3	The months are the Ayus, the Ushas are the Arunas, the Sun is the Etash, these are the Ashvins.
22.6.4	The year is Agni Vaisvānara.
22.6.5	Animals are Ida.
22.6.6	Animals are ghee.
22.6.7	Animals are born after the year.
22.6.8	He generates animals for him from the year itself.
22.6.9	He offers on a darbha stalk.
22.6.10	Or, whatever is her immortal (part), whatever is her strength, that he pours forth.
22.6.11	He offers in that which is her immortal (portion) and her strength.
22.6.12	One who offers thus does not die before his time.
22.6.13	"The variegated army of the gods has risen."
22.6.14	He offers on the head of a man.
22.6.15	Day is Mitra.
22.6.16	Night is Varuna.
22.6.17	This is all that exists.
22.6.18	Whatever exists, he touches.
22.6.19	He offers with a Sūrya verse.
22.6.20	Therefore, among animals, the man alone faces the sun, others face away from it.
22.6.21	Because he offers twice with the same verse, therefore a man has two feet.
22.6.22	He who does not yoke himself to the Agni Yoga when it has come, and does not yoke himself when others are yoked,
22.6.23	For thou, O Agni, art the summoner of the gods, and thou art the summoner for them.
22.6.24	He thus yokes Agni when he has come to the yoke.
22.6.25	He yokes him in those who are yoking him, who know thus.
22.6.26	He yoked him with two (verses).
22.6.27	The two are not rigid.
22.6.28	He who does not unyoke Agni when he has arrived at the unyoking, and does not unyoil him in those who unyoke him,
22.6.29	Earth is like a mother to her son, the man.
22.6.30	He thus releases Agni when he has come.
22.6.31	He releases those who are being released, he who knows thus.
22.6.32	Now these are the Sanyani (verses).
22.6.33	These are the divine deities leading to heaven.
22.6.34	By them alone one goes to the heavenly world.
22.6.35	This indeed is the Gāyatrī with luminous wings.
22.6.36	By it alone one goes to heaven.
22.6.37-43	Just as a boat crosses from water to water, so does one cross over to the other world through these (stones). That is why they are called 'crossers'. Now these are the names of the seasons. One indeed obtains the seasons. 'Sumeka' (means) the year. One indeed attains the year.
22.6.44	Now these are the bricks of the sun.
22.6.45	The sun takes away the brilliance of him who is about to build a fire-altar, and does not shine.
22.6.46	When these are laid down, it is as if one were to add more to something shining. Thus he places the brilliance in him in an increasing manner.
22.6.47	The sun does not take away his brilliance.
22.6.48	As he is among the gods, so is he among men.
22.6.49	Now these bricks of ghee.
22.6.50	Fire is brilliance.
22.6.51	Ghee is brilliance.
22.6.52	He places brilliance in brilliance.
22.6.53	Now these are the bricks for rain.
22.6.54	He obtains rain with these.
22.6.55	With these, Agni, when built, rains as he wishes.
22.6.56-61	That is the nature of the clouds. Now these are the Self. This indeed did Shankha Kousya say to his son Agni who was about to perform the fire sacrifice: "Do not perform the fire sacrifice." "Why?" "Because all the Self is not Agni." "But how can it be that all the Self is Agni?"
22.6.62	When these are placed, he builds the fire with a self.
22.6.63	They become re-cut.
22.6.64	He joins the breath with the breath.
22.6.65	Now this is the sixth layer.
22.6.66	If one who is building a fire does not succeed, he should place this sixth layer.
22.6.67	There are six seasons in a year.
22.6.68	He stands firm in the seasons themselves in the year.
22.6.69	These are indeed the deities leading to heaven.
22.6.70	By means of them one goes to the heavenly world.
22.6.71	These are the deities to be invoked.
22.6.72	One should say to him whom one hates, "I place him in your jaws."
22.6.73	He is indeed turned away from these deities.
22.6.74	He is indeed destroyed.
22.7.1	The gods went to heaven by means of Agni.
22.7.2	They were pursued by the Raksases, who followed them from behind.
22.7.3	The gods saw these Vitarani bricks.
22.7.4	With them they killed the Raksases.
22.7.5	When he lays down two in front and two behind,
22.7.6	he places the eyes on both sides for the sake of killing the Raksases.
22.7.7	They are of the same size as the sacrificial grass, for the release of the vital airs, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
22.7.8	There are four.
22.7.9	From that, the eyes have four forms, two white and two black.
22.7.10	For the attainment of the heaven, Agni is piled up.
22.7.11	If one were to make it eleven-fold, one would be seized by the thunderbolt in front and would not attain heaven.
22.7.12	If the animals of one who has performed the Ekādaśina sacrifice are not protected,
22.7.13	one should offer eleven animals on one stake.
22.7.14	It is indeed heavenly.
22.7.15	It protects the animals.
22.7.16	One should not make it equal to the wings.
22.7.17	If one were to make it equal to wings, one would approach a lesser sacrificial rite.
22.7.18	One's own progeny would be inferior.
22.7.19	This is what Jātaśākaṇya said to Śaṅkha Kauṣya.
22.7.20	"The Ekādaśini (eleventh day) is measured by the length of the wings, and it is called Ameṣṭa."
22.7.21	Having heard about the lesser sacrificial rite, he approached.
22.7.22	"He thought, 'This will be the offspring of my sinful self.'"
22.7.23	Then they consider him to be defeated.
22.7.24	One should measure it by the length of a Veda.
22.7.25	He approaches the sacrifice of the elder.
22.7.26	His offspring does not become inferior.
22.7.27	They say, "For whom is Agni to be piled up?"
22.7.28	Agni is piled up so that the gods may know him.
22.7.29	He who, knowing this, piles up Agni, the gods know him.
22.7.30	They say "For whom is Agnis to be piled up?"
22.7.31	"My house is here" - thus the fire is piled up.
22.7.32	He who, knowing this, piles up the fire, becomes a householder.
22.7.33	They say, "For whom is the fire piled up?"
22.7.34	"Food is obtained" - thus the Agni is piled up. 
22.7.35	He who, knowingly, piles up the Agni, eats food.
22.7.36	One should observe the vow after piling up the fire.
22.7.37	Having first built the fire, one should not approach his wife.
22.7.38	Having built the second, one should not go to other women.
22.7.39	Having built a third, one should not (go to) any (woman).
22.7.40	One who builds a fire places semen.
22.7.41	If one approaches (his wife), one would be deprived of semen.
22.7.42	They say that those bricks which are the semen-seeds are the semen-bearers of the fire-builder.
22.7.43	Therefore, one should approach it.
22.7.44	One who is going to perform the first sacrifice should offer a thousand bricks.
22.7.45	This world is of the size of a thousand.
22.7.46	One who performs the second sacrifice should offer two thousand bricks.
22.7.47	It is of the size equal to the atmosphere.
22.7.48	One who offers the third sacrifice should offer three thousand bricks.
22.7.49	These are the three worlds.
22.7.50	It is equal to these worlds.
22.7.51-58	Prajapati, indeed, created Agni in the form of a fire-altar. By that he created the creatures. They entered him. He said, "He alone shall prosper among my creatures who will build this (fire-altar). Agni is Prajapati. When one builds Agni, one builds Prajapati. One prospers. That is the reason why it is called 'cit'.
22.7.59	He gave it to the Vasus.
22.7.60	With that, the Vasus created three hundred and thirty.
22.7.61	Those Vasus gave it to the Rudras.
22.7.62	With that the Rudras created three hundred and sixty.
22.7.63	Those Rudras gave it to the Adityas.
22.7.64	The Adityas created three hundred and thirty.
22.7.65	The Ukha is the thousandth.
22.7.66	He who knows the Ukha as the thousandth goes to the thousandfold prosperity of cattle.
22.8.1	The Agni should be built in accordance with the prescribed form.
22.8.2	He who builds the Agni in accordance with the form prescribed, does not have any other form.
22.8.3	He should touch the first layer of bricks laid down with the Gayatri verse, the second with the Tristubh verse, the third with the Jagati verse, the fourth with the Anustubh verse and the fifth with the Pankti verse.
22.8.4	One builds the fire in the form in which it is built, and it does not take on another form.
22.8.5	The first layer is the breath, the second layer is the Vyana breath, and the third layer is the Apana breath.
22.8.6	He kindles it with the Prāṇāpāna breaths.
22.8.7	This is the division of Ida.
22.8.8	Ida is cattle.
22.8.9	He builds him with cattle.
22.8.10	One should build Agni after having told Prajapati.
22.8.11	He who builds Agni without having told Prajapata suffers misfortune.
22.8.12	The horses should stand around, a black one to the north and a white one to the south.
22.8.13	One should offer them at each brick.
22.8.14	This is indeed the form of Prajapati.
22.8.15	The horse is of Prajapati's nature.
22.8.16	He indeed offers to Prajapati and Agni.
22.8.17	He does not meet with misfortune.
22.8.18	He gives a golden vessel filled with honey to the Brahman.
22.8.19	He becomes one who enjoys honey.
22.8.20	One hundred.
22.8.21	Man has a life span of one hundred years and one hundred powers.
22.8.22	He indeed obtains life and power.
22.8.23-30	The bright array of the gods has risen. He looks at the bright one. He becomes bright. At midday he makes the horse smell. This is indeed the sun. This is Indra, the Prajapati. The horse is Prajapati. He becomes visible.
22.8.31	He who knows the attainment of Agni attains him, for whom Agni is piled up.
22.8.32	One should approach the piled up Agni while departing.
22.8.33	"With initiation, with austerity, with sacrifice, with Avabhṛtha, with Vasha, you attain."
22.8.34	It becomes five.
22.8.35	There are five seasons.
22.8.36	The seasons are the year.
22.8.37-42	The year is Agni Vaiśvānara. One attains the desire for which Agni is kindled. The Brahmanists say that it is one brick. Speech is one brick. The Brahman is one brick. These are the worlds.
22.8.43	They say, the three bricks called "Sarkara" are known to us. We know the three worlds to be the Agni to be kindled.
22.8.44	Agni should be kindled with truth.
22.8.45	One should touch the first brick with the word "bhūr", the second with the word "bhuvah" and the third with the word "svar".
22.8.46	This is indeed the truth of speech.
22.8.47	He builds the fire with truth.
22.8.48	The Brahmavādins say that the fire is built with truth, without truth.
22.8.49	He who builds it thus builds it with truth.
22.8.50	They say, "For which deity is the fire built?" The Brahmavādins reply,
22.8.51	For Prajapati alone.
22.8.52	What is the offering for him?
22.8.53	The self itself.
22.9.1	Water was here, only water.
22.9.2	That Prajapati, having become wind, moved on the lotus leaf.
22.9.3	He did not find support.
22.9.4	He saw this nest of water.
22.9.5	Prajapati built this fire in the middle of the water.
22.9.6	This became.
22.9.7	Then he stood firm.
22.9.8	This is indeed Agni.
22.9.9	Therefore, whatever they dig here, they dig for the desired (earth), they dig for the gravel.
22.9.10	What he placed in front, that became the head.
22.9.11	That is the eastern direction.
22.9.12	What he put on the right side, that became the right wing.
22.9.13	That is called the southern direction.
22.9.14	What was placed behind, that became the tail.
22.9.15	That is known as the western direction.
22.9.16-23	The northern direction was the northern wing. The western direction was the western wing. The southern direction was the southern wing. The northern direction was the upper wing. The upper direction was the upper part. This is Agni, the five-brick. He who knows this is born, goes, and attains stability. The Brahman is Agni. Therefore, one should give to a Brahman in all directions.
22.9.24	He follows his own direction.
22.9.25	For all this world shines by night for the Vayas.
22.9.26	Therefore these Vayas do not approach by night.
22.9.27	This is the nest of the waters.
22.9.28	Therefore the waters are very near to it.
22.9.29	For this is the nest of waters.
22.10.1-5	If he thinks that his enemy has gone before him, then he should place eight Lokamprinas before the Bahispavamana. Eleven before the Madhyandina Pavamana. Twelve before the Arbhava Pavamana. This indeed is the Pavamana. Vayu is the brilliance of Agni.
22.10.6	He who has gone before him is his enemy, he drives him away by means of his energy.
22.10.7	If he thinks that his enemy will be behind him, he should place them behind these Pavamana verses.
22.10.8	This indeed is the Pavamana, he who blows.
22.10.9	Vayu is the energy of Agni.
22.10.10	He who is his enemy behind him, he drives him off by means of his power.
22.10.11	He pushes away the better brother.
22.10.12	He pushes away the worse brother.
22.10.13	This is the one who is sacrificed to.
22.10.14	Prajapati was afraid of the fire in the cauldron.
22.10.15	His head fell off.
22.10.16	The gods became exhausted by it.
22.10.17	They put his head back.
22.10.18	When Agni, Prajapati, ascended the cauldron, he ascended the year.
22.10.19-23	The one who carries the fire for a year. He restores the head of Prajapati. Therefore, the fire should be carried for a year. If it is carried for less than a year, it is not proper. The gods who ascended upwards with light, the Adityas and Vasus, and the Rudras,
22.10.24	By means of that (fire) by which the Angirases attained greatness, may the sacrificer come (here) with welfare. Having anointed the kindling-wood with ghee, he places it.
22.10.25	This is indeed a kindling-wood.
22.10.26	And this is indeed a means of welfare for the sacrificer.
22.10.27	The fires that have entered the ashes, following the earth,
22.10.28	Of these, you are the best. Do thou, O Agni, for our life, bestow wealth. He should approach his own Agni, saying, "Thou art Agni, the best."
22.10.29	He attains the whole span of life.
22.10.30	"O Agni, I approach thee day by day."
22.10.31	With this three-verse hymn, he should approach others.
22.10.32	It is indeed a blessing.
22.11.1	When the Dhishnya bricks are laid down, then with three Barhaspatya bricks he lays down three towards the south.
22.11.2	Then with three Yamya bricks three towards the east.
22.11.3	Then with the three Rudra bricks three towards the south of the animal sacrifice.
22.11.4	Then with thee Varuni bricks three in the Avabhrtha.
22.11.5	The Rakshas demons tried to steal the sacrifice of the gods from the south.
22.11.6	They were slain by Brahma.
22.11.7	Brahma is Brihaspati.
22.11.8	The offerings to Brihaspati are placed in the south for the sake of destroying the Rakshas.
22.11.9	Now the Yami goddesses.
22.11.10	By these goddesses, the Asura Devala obtained the lower and higher worlds.
22.11.11	Those who are placed here, may these worlds, the lower and the higher, shine for him.
22.11.12	Now the Rudra ones.
22.11.13	This is indeed Rudra. The animal sacrifice is itself.
22.11.14	He is indeed the lord of this. Having risen from here, he would destroy.
22.11.15	By placing the Rudra ones, he appeases Rudra by that.
22.11.16	Now the Varuna ones.
22.11.17	The waters are indeed Varuna.
22.11.18	This is indeed the Lord, who is released from the Avabhṛtha, and is seized by Varuna.
22.11.19	When he lays down the Varuni bricks, it is for release from Varuna.
22.12.1	If this deity were to injure the creatures while being carried on the Ukhā, then with the three Agniya and Bhisagvatī bricks he should lay down three kindling-sticks.
22.12.2	This indeed is what this deity injures.
22.12.3	Whatever she puts in with the Bhishaghvatis, she makes it a remedy.
22.12.4	That is indeed peace.
22.12.5	If one desires rain when the fire is being carried around, one should put in three kindling-sticks with the three Sūrya-rays-possessing verses.
22.12.6	When Parjanya does not rain, he indeed throws his creatures into distress.
22.12.7	When he places the rays, he causes rain to fall.
22.12.8	It rains immediately.
22.12.9	If one desires that it should not rain when the oblation is being carried on the fire, one should place three kindling woods with the three rays of the sun.
22.12.10	It causes brightness.
22.12.11	It does not rain equally.
22.12.12	If the ladle is broken while being heated, one should place it on these four (bricks) with the formulas, "O Agni, turning back, O Agni, Angiras, again with energy and wealth."
22.12.13	They indeed find (the ladle).
22.13.1	They make the eastern beam.
22.13.2	The eastern direction indeed belongs to the gods.
22.13.3	He indeed turns towards the world of gods.
22.13.4	This is the eastern direction.
22.13.5	He goes up to this very sun.
22.13.6	They consecrate him when the Parashrita (rite) is performed.
22.13.7	Having surrounded the world of gods, they consecrate him in it.
22.13.8	He who goes to the other world from this world,
22.13.9	The other world is as if hidden from here.
22.13.10	One should perform the consecration in the Sraktis.
22.13.11-19	Therefore he does not go from this world. He offers a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni-Vishnu. Agni is all the deities. Vishnu is the sacrifice. Having obtained the deities and the sacrifice, he approaches initiation. Agni indeed is the purifier. Vishnu indeed is the sacrifice. Having obtained the purifier and the sacrifice, one approaches the sacrifice. Since it is on eight potsherds, it is dedicated to Agni.
22.13.20	The one with three potsherds is for Vishnu.
22.13.21	One does not go to both by that.
22.13.22	One offers the Agni-Vishnu oblation on eleven potsherds.
22.13.23	Agni is the lowest of the gods.
22.13.24	Vishnu is the highest.
22.13.25	Just as one would take up the two ends of a rope, so here one takes up the two ends and pours the oblation in the middle.
22.13.26-31	The cake should be for one who desires Brahmic glory. The cake is the head of the sacrifice. The cake means Brahmic glory. One becomes Brahmic glory. The cake should be in ghee for one who desires offspring or cattle. Ghee and rice are a pair.
22.13.32	The cow's ghee, the buffalo's rice.
22.13.33	He places the pair at the mouth of the sacrifice for procreation.
22.13.34	For this is the form from which the oblation-cake is made.
22.13.35	For the initiated one goes to this world as if moving.
22.13.36	For he initiates himself for this world.
22.13.37	When it is an oblation-cake, it is for prosperity.
22.13.38	He anoints.
22.13.39	He anoint.
22.13.40	He bathes.
22.13.41	He puts on a garment.
22.13.42	These are the body parts of a man.
22.13.43	Having become all body parts, he approaches the consecration.
22.13.44	A man is defective, impure within.
22.13.45	When he eats, it is for the sake of purity and for the sake of being without defects.
22.13.46	In this way, in the other world, as one is being consecrated.
22.13.47	One should perform the vow thus: "May he not torment me."
22.13.48	Now, if one who is consecrated for a sacrifice is about to perform a vow, he should eat thus.
22.13.49	He shaves his hair and beard.
22.13.50	He cuts his nails.
22.13.51	He cleans his teeth.
22.13.52	This is the dead man's impurity.
22.13.53	Having removed the impurity, he approaches the purity.
22.13.54	He bathes.
22.13.55	The Angirasas, having deposited the consecration in the water, went to the heavenly world.
22.13.56	He who bathes in it, obtains that very consecration.
22.13.57	One should be affectionate to the one who is struck by the noose.
22.13.58	For it is by placing him in the noose that one goes.
22.13.59	If one bathes with as much water as there is, one obtains that very consecration with that.
22.13.60	One should not bathe in flowing water.
22.13.61	If one were to bathe in flowing water, one would attain the glory of the warrior.
22.13.62	One should not bathe in a well.
22.13.63	If one bathes in a well, one would attain misfortune and fame.
22.13.64	One should bathe in a standing (pool).
22.13.65	These are the initiated ones of the waters, the ones with animals, which are standing.
22.13.66	They are hairy and continuous.
22.13.67	Animals are hairy.
22.13.68	One makes the sacrificer attain fame.
22.13.69	One must bathe at a sacred place.
22.13.70	One becomes a sacred place among equals.
23.1.1	The consecrated one is the oblation.
23.1.2	One does not attain the oblation without ghee.
23.1.3	When he anoints, he anoints it for the sake of being fit for oblation.
23.1.4	Ghee is of the gods.
23.1.5	Butter is of men.
23.1.6	Butter-milk is of Gandharvas.
23.1.7	Butter is self-melted of the sun.
23.1.8	This is neither divine nor human, namely butter.
23.1.9	He who is consecrated is neither among the gods nor among men.
23.1.10	He has fallen from this world.
23.1.11	He has not attained the other world.
23.1.12	When he anoints himself with ghee, it is for prosperity.
23.1.13	He puts on a garment.
23.1.14	It is the sheath of Agni.
23.1.15	It is a turban of the ancestors.
23.1.16	It is an opening of the plants.
23.1.17	It is wind's wind-cloth.
23.1.18-25	The threads and the warp of all the gods. The stars are the lights. The garment belongs to all the gods. The one who is consecrated belongs to all the gods. He indeed prospers with all the deities. He anoints himself. Indra, while slaying Vritra, was attacked by the demons. He hid them in the mountain of ointment.
23.1.26	The Rakshas follow him who is consecrated.
23.1.27	For this reason,
23.1.28	He anoints himself, to hide from the Rakshas.
23.1.29	Indra killed Vritra.
23.1.30	His eye fell down.
23.1.31	It entered the Trikakubha (the three-cornered altar).
23.1.32	When he anoints, it is for the recovery of that eye.
23.1.33	He anoints twice on the right side and once on the left.
23.1.34	The sacrifice is threefold.
23.1.35	One performs the sacrifice from the mouth itself.
23.1.36	One applies the paste three times to the right and twice to the left.
23.1.37	The sacrifice is applied.
23.1.38	One indeed obtains the sacrifice.
23.1.39	One applies it first to the right.
23.1.40	Because humans apply it first to the left, for turning away.
23.1.41	One applies with the Yajus.
23.1.42	For men anoint themselves with the Yajus, for the purpose of separation.
23.1.43	He anoints the posterior part.
23.1.44	He does not anoint the anterior part.
23.1.45	For men anoint themselves from the posterior to the anterior part, for the purpose separation.
23.1.46	He smears with a grass-blade.
23.1.47	For men smear themselves with Salla grass, for the purpose, of separation.
23.1.48	It becomes with cotton.
23.1.49	Cotton is friendly.
23.1.50	The fallen leaves are Varuna's.
23.1.51	The initiated one is friendly.
23.1.52	for prosperity.
23.1.53	The eye is like a deficiency, like a hole.
23.1.54	When one anoints, one fills it in, for the sake of being without holes.
23.1.55	One purifies.
23.1.56	Indra indeed killed Vritra.
23.1.57	He killed him in the waters.
23.1.58	Of those, those that were fit for sacrifice, worthy of sacrifice, they escaped.
23.1.59	They became plants.
23.1.60	The darbha grass is that splendor.
23.1.61	Therefore, they are pure.
23.1.62	Therefore, they purify water with darbha grass.
23.1.63	When one purifies with darbha grass and darbha grass tufts,
23.1.64	one purifies him with the brilliance of water and plants.
23.1.65	One purifies with two (darbha tufts),
23.1.66	two are truth and untruth.
23.1.67	One putifies his untruth with truth.
23.1.68	Two are the breath and the out-breath.
23.1.69	One putifies with three (darbha tuft),
23.1.70	The gods are three times three.
23.1.71	And there are three breaths: prāṇa, vyāna, and apāna.
23.1.72	He places them in the sacrificer.
23.1.73	He purifies with five (verses).
23.1.74	Man is fivefold.
23.1.75	He putifies as much as his self is.
23.1.76	He putifies with seven (verses).
23.1.77	There are seven metres.
23.1.78	He putrfies him with the metres.
23.1.79	He purities with nine (verses).
23.1.80	Nine breaths.
23.1.81	He purifies him with the breaths.
23.1.82	He (the sacrificer) purifies with twenty-one (breaths).
23.1.83	Man is twenty-one, ten fingers, ten toes, and the self is the twenty-first.
23.1.84	He pusifies him as much as his self is.
23.1.85	May Citpati purify you.
23.1.86	Citpati is indeed Brahman.
23.1.87	He putifies him with Brahman.
23.1.88	"May Vakpati purify you."
23.1.89	He is the purifier.
23.1.90	"May the god Savitar purify you."
23.1.91	It is with the deities that he purifies him, impelled by Savitar.
23.1.92	"With the stainless purifier."
23.1.93	He purifies him with the stainless purifier.
23.1.94	"With rays of the sun."
23.1.95	He pusifies him with the body of the sun.
23.1.96	"He says, 'Purify this, O purifier of the sacred thread.'
23.1.97	The sacrifice is the lord of the sacred thread.
23.1.98	He purifies it for the sacrifice.
23.1.99	He says, 'I am able to purify for whomsoever I am able to purify.'
23.1.100	He says, in effect, 'I am capable of performing the sacrifice.'
23.1.101	He purifieth the body.
23.1.102	The breath is in the body.
23.1.103	When the breath becomes horizontal, then one dies.
23.1.104	If one were to purify a beast, one would make his breath a beast. He would die.
23.1.105	He makes his breath follow his own.
23.1.106	He purifies outside.
23.1.107	Having purified him in the human world, he sends him to the pure divine world.
23.2.1	The embryo is the consecrated one, the womb is the consecrated one's measure, the membrane is the consecrated one’s garment, the placenta is the black antelope skin.
23.2.2	From this very womb Indra was born.
23.2.3	Having made the covering, he approaches.
23.2.4	Therefore, one should not let the sun rise or set on an initiated person except at the distance of an initiated person.
23.2.5	One is born from one's own womb.
23.2.6	"To Akriti, to Pratiti, to Agni, Svāhā!"
23.2.7	The sacrifice is indeed performed with a purpose.
23.2.8	He offers it at the very place where the sacrifice is performed.
23.2.9	"He offers it with the formula, "To Medha, to Manas, to Agni, svāhā."
23.2.10	One indeed approaches with Medha and Manas.
23.2.11	"He says, "To the sacrificers, svāhā," thus he offers the sacrifice."
23.2.12	"He offers with the formula, "To Initiation, to Tapas, to Agni, Svāhā."
23.2.13	Indeed, one attains the sacrifice through Initiation and Tapas.
23.2.14	He indeed wins the sacrifice.
23.2.15	"To Sarasvati, to Pusan, to Agni, to Svāhā."
23.2.16	Sarasvati is speech.
23.2.17	Pusan is cattle.
23.2.18	The sacrifice is offered to cattle through speech.
23.2.19	He offers the sacrifice to cattle through speech itself.
23.2.20	"The goddesses, the great, the all-nourishing waters."
23.2.21	The waters are the sacrifice.
23.2.22	The sacrifice in heaven, in the atmosphere, on earth.
23.2.23	Brahma is Brihaspati.
23.2.24	Here, here indeed is the sacrifice.
23.2.25	Wherever there is a sacrifice, there he offers it to Brahma.
23.2.26	He offers these five oblations.
23.2.27	The sacrifice is fivefold.
23.2.28	He indeed wins the sacrifice.
23.2.29	These are the requisites of the sacrifice, namely, these mantras.
23.2.30	If he were not to offer these, his sacrifice would be without requisites.
23.2.31	Whatever he offers with these (oblations), he gathers as much as the sacrifice.
23.2.32	One who is not initiated, offers with one oblation.
23.2.33	Those whose these are not offered, their food is eaten by others.
23.2.34	When he offers with these, it is for initiation and for the second status.
23.2.35	He offers with "To Agni svāhā, to Agni svāhā."
23.2.36	Agni is all the deities.
23.2.37	All the deities are indeed included in this.
23.2.38	One offers five oblations.
23.2.39	The sixth is the Audgrabhan.
23.2.40	There are six seasons.
23.2.41	One indeed stands firm in the seasons.
23.2.42	When the sacrifice was created, the Yajus slipped away, the Sama slipped away.
23.2.43	It was indeed the Rig that held it together. There are nine Sāmans, twelve Yajuses,
23.2.44	Therefore they chant the Bahispavamāna with nine verses.
23.2.45	They offer the Udgrabhana oblation with two verses.
23.2.46	When one offers the Udgrab hana oblation with twoverses, one causes the created sacrifice to be raised up with the verse.
23.2.47	The Karudveshinas used to offer the Udgrabhana oblation with twelve verses.
23.2.48	One should offer it after making it twelvefold.
23.2.49-56	By that alone he obtains it. One offers with a full ladle. Prajapati is full. One obtains Prajapati. If one were to offer with a deficient (ladle), one would make a world for one's brother. The full (ladle) is the desire. One makes for the full (ladle), whatever desire one desires. One obtains whatever desire one desires.
23.2.57	Anushtubh is the self-nature of Prajapati's metre.
23.2.58	Prajapati is the sacrifice.
23.2.59	When one offers the Udgṛbhṇāni in Anushtubh,
23.2.60	one establishes the sacrifice in its own metre.
23.2.61	The sacrifice is established in the metres.
23.2.62	It should be established in the metres as they are.
23.2.63	This is the Anushtubh.
23.2.64	It has seven syllables, one foot, and three feet of eight syllables.
23.2.65	Of those seven, three are the eight Upayanti.
23.2.66	Those are eleven.
23.2.67	That is Tristup.
23.2.68	Of those four, those are the eight Upayantis.
23.2.69	Those are twelve.
23.2.70	That is Jagati.
23.2.71	Those eight are Gāyatrī.
23.2.72	Anushtubh is undivided.
23.2.73	The Pankti is with the Svāhā sound.
23.2.74	These are the extent of the metres.
23.2.75	He establishes the sacrifice in the Chandas in accordance with the Chandas.
23.2.76	The sacrifice was created by the deities to be worshipped.
23.2.77	"The whole is the path of the god."
23.2.78	Since it has the path, it is Savitri.
23.2.79	"Mrt" is for the Pitrs.
23.2.80	"Vishva" is for the Vaishvadevas.
23.2.81	"Dyumn" is for Brihaspati.
23.2.82	"Pashyatu" is for Pushan.
23.2.83	"Svasa" is for Sarasvati.
23.2.84	These are the only deities.
23.2.85	He offers the sacrifice created by the deities.
23.2.86	The sacrifice created entered into three parts: into the Rk with one part, into the Sama with one part, and into the Yajus with one part.
23.2.87	The part of it that was dear entered into the Yajush.
23.2.88	Therefore the Yajush should not be recited loudly.
23.2.89	The sacrifice, his beloved body, is moving upwards.
23.2.90	One becomes without brahmic lustre, naked, and one who is about to die.
23.3.1	The sacrifice indeed fled from the gods, becoming black.
23.3.2	From that sacrifice which was returning again, the Ṛk and Sāman fled.
23.3.3	They entered the black sacrifice, thinking it to be the sacrifice.
23.3.4	The Sāman is white.
23.3.5	The Ṛk is black.
23.3.6	When one is initiated with a black antelope skin, one obtains the Ṛg and Sāman verses.
23.3.7	Indeed, day and night became a couple.
23.3.8	From them, strength and power departed.
23.3.9	It entered the black (antelope).
23.3.10	When one is initiated with the black antelope skin, he obtains the strength and power of day and night.
23.3.11	Indeed, heaven and earth became a couple.
23.3.12	The divine splendour of them both departed.
23.3.13	It entered the black (cow).
23.3.14	When one is initiated with a black garment, he obtains the divine splendour of heaven and earth.
23.3.15	They are established in the art of the Ṛg and Sāman verses. He obtains the Ṛg verses and Sāman chants.
23.3.16	Just as two boats crossing a river help each other,
23.3.17	You are the protector of the directions.
23.3.18	Grant me protection.
23.3.19	And he mounts the sacrifice and the gods.
23.3.20	When one desires to be better, then one repels the worse.
23.3.21	He pays homage to the gods and the sacrifice, so that he may not be repelled.
23.3.22	The other metres had speed, the others did not have speed.
23.3.23	They raced in a race.
23.3.24	Those which had the swift ones, they entered the black one, saying, "We shall burn those which had the swift."
23.3.25	Those are the sacrifices which carry.
23.3.26	Those which had the non-swift ones, they entered into the black one, thinking, "We shall enter those which had the non swift."
23.3.27	Those became the metres.
23.3.28	Those which were not the carriers of sacrifice, they went to self-sovereignty.
23.3.29	He who knows this goes to his own kingdom.
23.3.30	He who is initiated with a black antelope skin obtains the metres that are swift, those that are not swift, and those that are both.
23.3.31	Hotr indeed departed from the gods.
23.3.32	Then the Vasat-call followed him, having become black.
23.3.33	The oblation is not spilled from the Vasat-cry.
23.3.34	Therefore they grind the oblation on the black antelope skin.
23.3.35	The consecrated one is the oblation.
23.3.36	Therefore he sits on the black antelope hide.
23.3.37	Therefore he does not spit, lest the oblation should be spilled.
23.3.38	The sacrifice and the deities are outside the animals, and the fat is inside.
23.3.39	If the outer hair is made of black antelope skin, the sacrificer would be hidden from the sacrifice and the deities.
23.3.40	If the inner hair is made of inner skin, the sacrifice would be hidden from deities.
23.3.41	One should make two (pieces) of the inner flesh and the outer hair.
23.3.42	If there is one (piece), one should sew it at the foot.
23.3.43	The sacrificer is not separated from the sacrifice and the deities.
23.3.44	The sacrifice is not separated from deities.
23.3.45	You are the protection of Vishnu, the protection of the sacrificer.
23.3.46	Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
23.3.47	The sacrificer is Vaisnava.
23.3.48	By means of Vishnu alone, he makes himself yoked on both sides with the sacrifice.
23.3.49	The womb of that sacrifice which was created, enveloped it.
23.3.50	That became the garment of the initiated.
23.3.51	The embryo is the initiated.
23.3.52	When he puts on the garment of the initiate, he covers himself with his own womb.
23.3.53	Therefore, a great rite is performed.
23.3.54	For indeed, the embryo is as if covered by the womb, as if hidden.
23.3.55	He should not speak what is contrary to the truth.
23.4.1	The Angirasas, going to the heavenly world, scattered their girdles.
23.4.2	From that the arrow stood up.
23.4.3	If the girdle is made of arrow, one takes that very girdle.
23.4.4	The gods, where they divided the strength,
23.4.5	From that the arrows stood up.
23.4.6	The girdle which is made of grass, he takes hold of that very strength.
23.4.7	The girdle is indeed strength.
23.4.8	He spreads it around the middle.
23.4.9	He places strength in the middle, in the sacrificer and in the offspring.
23.4.10	Therefore, from the middle, offspring are strong.
23.4.11	He spreads around the navel.
23.4.12	Above the navel of man is the pure;
23.4.13	Below is the impure.
23.4.14-21	For the exclusion of the pure and the impure. It is three-fold. Prajapati created beings with the three-fold Stoma. The thunderbolt is three-fold He strikes his enemy with the thunderbolt. Indra struck Vritra with the thunderbolt. The part of it that fell down became the arrow. That is the arrowness of the arrow.
23.4.22-30	The arrow is indeed a thunderbolt. If the girdle is made of arrows, he strikes his brother with a thunderbolt. He should give it to him. He should meditate on the one whom he hates while giving it away. He strikes him with a thunderbolt. The girdle is for a man. The yoke is for a woman. A woman is a girdle. A man is a yoke.
23.4.31	The two (priests) indeed turn the mouth of the sacrifice upside down for procreation.
23.4.32	The girdle is indeed the thunderbolt, the belly is hunger.
23.4.33	The enemy is sin.
23.4.34	When he puts on the girdle, he indeed strikes down the enemy, sin, with the thunderbolt.
23.4.35	Sacrifice was among the gods, the Dakṣiṇā among the fathers.
23.4.36	That sacrifice desired the Dakṣiṇa.
23.4.37	The Pitrs said, "We desire a share in the gods."
23.4.38	They said, "You have been the share of the third pressing."
23.4.39	Therefore, the third pressing is performed for the Pitrs.
23.4.40	He called her.
23.4.41	She ran at the call.
23.4.42	Therefore, a man runs at the call of a woman.
23.4.43	Therefore, the learned man is most desirous of women.
23.4.44	For he was the most worthy of the sacrifice.
23.4.45	Indra understood that.
23.4.46	He thought, "Whoever is born from this will be this."
23.4.47	He entered that womb.
23.4.48	From that he was born.
23.4.49	He looked back again.
23.4.50	He thought "Whoever is born after this will be my enemy."
23.4.51	Having cut it off, he cuts it off.
23.4.52	It becomes a horn.
23.4.53	When it becomes a horn, he offers it in the form of the seed of the sacrifice, in the form of Indra's womb, in the form (of the womb) of the Dakshina.
23.4.54	It becomes five-fold.
23.4.55	For with five (blades) he cut it off.
23.4.56	"It is Indra's womb."
23.4.57	For this is Indra's abode.
23.4.58	"For thee, O agriculture, for good harvest."
23.4.59	Therefore, what is sown is cooked.
23.4.60	One should scratch with the Yajus.
23.4.61	Therefore, plants grow above.
23.4.62	One should itch with the Yajusha.
23.4.63	Because humans itch with the Yajur, for exclusion.
23.4.64	If one itches with the Yajurusha, one would itch like Varuna. Even the embryos would be born with scabs.
23.4.65	Speech enters the gods and men.
23.4.66	What of it remained over entered the trees.
23.4.67	That is the speech that speaks in the trees, in the drum, in the pipe, in the bow.
23.4.68	When it becomes a stick, it seizes the excess of speech.
23.4.69	He gives it to the Maitrāvaruṇa.
23.4.70	He gives him speech.
23.4.71	He always divides it among the priests.
23.4.72	Therefore his speech does not fail him.
23.4.73	It should be made as long as the mouth.
23.4.74	For this is how much this speech speaks.
23.4.75	And it is in this much speech that power is accomplished.
23.4.76	If a tree bears fruit, one should do it with the words, "May it be a bearer of fruit."
23.5.1	"Svāhā to the sacrifice, to the mind."
23.5.2	The sacrifice is performed by the mind.
23.5.3	The sacrifice has Vāyu as its source.
23.5.4	The sacrifice is in heaven, in the atmosphere, on earth.
23.5.5	The sacrifice here and there.
23.5.6	Wherever the sacrifice is, there he performs it with the mind.
23.5.7	He who stays there.
23.5.8	He stays there in the sacrifice.
23.5.9	If he were to abandon the sacrifice, he would abandon it.
23.5.10	If he abandons it, he should consecrate again.
23.5.11	If he were to consecrate again, he would exceed the offerings.
23.5.12	One should recite the Gāyatrī and Viṣṇu verses.
23.5.13	Speech is Gāyatrī.
23.5.14	Viṣṇu is the sacrifice.
23.5.15	One extends the sacrifice with speech.
23.5.16	One should then recite the Brhaspati verses.
23.5.17	Brhaspati is Brahman.
23.5.18	The sacrifice is completed with Brahman.
23.5.19	Brahmaṇā indeed, he makes the sacrifice complete.
23.5.20	One should recite the verse, "O Agni, you are the lord of vows," to Agni, the lord of vows.
23.5.21	One who is initiated but does not observe the vow goes against the lord of vows of that person.
23.5.22	Agni is the lord of vows among the gods.
23.5.23	One attains the vow from the lord of vows.
23.5.24	He does not initiate him, he is not a son of such and such a person. He says three times in a low voice and three times loudly.
23.5.25	He announces the sacrifice to both gods and men.
23.5.26	Having seen the constellation, he releases speech.
23.5.27	Men perform sacrifice during the day, and gods at night.
23.5.28	Having connected the night with the day, he offers the sacrifice to the gods for protection.
23.5.29	"He performs the vow."
23.5.30	He says this, indeed, "He performs the sacrifice."
23.5.31	This is a Paṅkti (verse) Vyāhṛti.
23.5.32	The sacrifice is Paṅkti.
23.5.33	This is indeed the proper invocation of speech.
23.5.34	The initiated one should not lie down with his head towards the east.
23.5.35	If he lies down with his head to the east, he would turn towards the world of gods.
23.5.36	He should not lie down facing the north.
23.5.37	If he were to lie down facing the south, he would turn toward the world of the ancestors.
23.5.38	The people are far from here, the ancestors are far.
23.5.39	One comes from the people.
23.5.40	One would be a deceiver.
23.5.41	One should lie down only sideways.
23.5.42	The consecrated one belongs to the sky-deity.
23.5.43	One lies down turning towards one's own world, one's own abode.
23.5.44	One should not lie down away from the fire.
23.5.45	Agni is all the deities.
23.5.46	One would turn away from the deities.
23.5.47	Having turned towards Agni, one should lie down.
23.5.48	Agni is all the deities.
23.5.49	One lies down, turning towards the deities.
23.5.50	"One thinks of the divine mind."
23.5.51	One purifies oneself with the Brahman for the sake of having brilliance.
23.5.52	"Then the waters did not let go of my consecration." Food had appeared to humans.
23.5.53	The gods sought it.
23.5.54	Those waters said, "Come back, we will make these tasty for you."
23.5.55	He came back.
23.5.56	When one who is consecrated performs the Marjalyana rite, it is for the purpose of securing food.
23.5.57	Therefore, a Brahmin should eat after taking food, and after washing his hands, it is for securing food.
23.5.58	One who is consecrated should not be offered oblations, nor should he be offered oblations.
23.5.59	The gods who are born of Manu, thus he consecrates.
23.5.60	The gods are the vital airs, born of Manu.
23.5.61	He consecrates in his own deity.
23.5.62	Thus his offering is not offered nor not offered.
23.5.63	"O Agni, you are well awake."
23.5.64	One about to sleep should recite this over the fire.
23.5.65	One who sleeps a lot may transgress the vow.
23.5.66	Agni is the lord of vows of the gods.
23.5.67	One who has given the vow to the lord of vows attains his desire.
23.5.68	One should recite the mantra "You are the lord of vows, O Agni" after waking up.
23.5.69	He gives the vow to the one who is the lord of the vow.
23.5.70	Agni is the lord of rites of the gods. The lord of rites is the lord of all rites.
23.5.71	One undertakes the vow from the lord of rites.
23.6.1	One who has been initiated should not offer oblations.
23.6.2	The initiated one is the oblation.
23.6.3	Agni is Rudra.
23.6.4	If one were to offer oblations, one would consign one's own self, which is the oblation, to Rudra.
23.6.5	And if one were not to offer oblations one would interrupt the sacrifice.
23.6.6	This is the vow: having placed the fire on the other side, one approaches the eastern fire.
23.6.7	One continues the sacrifice with that.
23.6.8	Just as a cow gives milk, so does he who consecrates himself offer the sacrifice to the gods.
23.6.9	If one were to offer, one would injure the sacrifice and would be deprived of it.
23.6.10	Just as one milks a cow that has been milked before, so does one do that.
23.6.11	If one offers above, then only once, when the gods have come, one milks the sacrifice.
23.6.12	All the oblations of him who is consecrated become.
23.6.13	For he who is initiated without being told (to do so),
23.6.14	he who eats the food of him, recites the sacrifice.
23.6.15	For him the expiation is by means of the sacrifice.
23.6.16	He who is initiated is indeed indicated by the noose.
23.6.17	The noose is Varuna's.
23.6.18	He who eats the food (of him) becomes liable to be seized by Varuna.
23.6.19	Therefore one should not eat the food of one who is bound or imprisoned.
23.6.20	This is the secret of the gods, the initiated one is the secret of men. Indeed, the secret is fragrant.
23.6.21	Therefore one should not eat the food of an initiated one.
23.6.22	The initiated one is divided into three kinds of sin.
23.6.23	He who eats food is the third.
23.6.24	He who speaks indecently is the third. 
23.6.25	He who takes the name is the third.
23.6.26	Therefore, one should not eat the food of one who has been initiated.
23.6.27	One should not recite obscene verses.
23.6.28	One should refrain from taking a name.
23.6.29	One is initiated for the sake of giving.
23.6.30	If one does this, it becomes untrue.
23.6.31	If one accepts, the embryo of one who has initiated is destroyed, and the embryo of one accepted is destroyed.
23.6.32	Pūṣan is the lord of the Sāman chants, Soma is the lord of wealth.
23.6.33	Pūshan is indeed the lord of the Sama chants.
23.6.34	Soma is the giver of wealth.
23.6.35	"One should say, "May Soma give (wealth)."
23.6.36	Soma gives to him what he gives away.
23.6.37	"One says, "May it be more in the future."
23.6.38	Because one will get it again.
23.6.39	"The god Savitr, the giver of wealth, gives wealth."
23.6.40	He accepts it being impelled by Savitr for the non-injury of himself.
23.6.41	The sacrifice did not proceed among the gods.
23.6.42	He makes him meditate on it with gifts.
23.6.43	When one who has been initiated seeks a livelihood, he makes the sacrifice prosper.
23.6.44	Therefore one who has been iniated should seek a livelihood for twelve nights.
23.6.45	He makes the sacrifice prosper as much as it is.
23.6.46	Gifts are taken to the gods, others to men.
23.6.47	He directs them thus:
23.6.48	"To Vayu you." When it is lost.
23.6.49	"To Nirriti thee!" thus to the one who is dying.
23.6.50	"To Rudra thee!" thus to one whom Rudra slays, or who is torn asunder.
23.6.51	"To Varuna thee!" thus to those who are in the water, or in the woods.
23.6.52	"To Yama thee!" thus to him who is slain by death.
23.6.53	These are taken away to the gods.
23.6.54	The others to men.
23.6.55	These are they.
23.6.56	The meritorious Brahman obtains more by these.
23.6.57	He who knows this prospers.
23.6.58	"The goddesses are the waters, the waters are the feet of the waters."
23.6.59	He takes the waters, taking what is suitable for the sacrifice and what is suitable for oblations, for non-injury.
23.6.60	Agni is the initiated one.
23.6.61	The waters pacify Agni.
23.6.62	He takes the water with a Yajus, for non-pacification.
23.6.63	For the waters are indeed pacifying.
23.6.64	Then he places himself in the fire, in the Self, in the Supreme Self.
23.6.65	If one were to cross the flowing waters without reciting the Yajus, the waters would be turbulent.
23.6.66	One crosses them with the Yajus.
23.6.67	Therefore the waters flow continuously, uninterrupted.
23.6.68	If one crosses a river, one should cross it by placing the sacrificial grass and the chariot.
23.6.69	Agni is all the deities, the chariot is the sacrifice.
23.6.70	And with the gods and the sacrifice, he crosses over.
23.6.71	One should sit down crushing a stone that is on the other side of the water.
23.6.72	By that, it does not come to him.
23.6.73	"This is your natural place of sacrifice." As per the Yajus.
23.6.74	"We have come to this divine sacrifice on earth." He determines the divine sacrifice.
23.6.75	"Crossing over with the verses and the Sama, with the Yajus."
23.6.76	And he enters the divine sacrifice with the Rk and Sama verses and with the deities.
23.7.1	The gods and the Asuras both performed the sacrifice together.
23.7.2	Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did the same: Agnihotra, Darsha-Paurnamasa, Catu-r-masya.
23.7.3	This was the sacrifice then.
23.7.4	The gods saw this Soma sacrifice.
23.7.5	They brought him.
23.7.6	They initiated him.
23.7.7	They performed the Agnihotra vow.
23.7.8	The Agnihotra is indeed the vow.
23.7.9	Therefore, the expiation for the Agnihotra that has been spilled is the expiation for a vow that has been spilled.
23.7.10	Therefore, one who is initiated should be in two vows.
23.7.11	For they offer the Agnihotra twice.
23.7.12	They made the Agniṣomīya animal, which is offered on the full-moon day, the one to be offered on the previous day.
23.7.13	The one offered at the Darsa is the Agnēya, which is offered after the Soma-pressing.
23.7.14	They made the Vaisvadev animal the morning pressing.
23.7.15	The Varuna-prastha animal the midday pressing.
23.7.16	The Sākamedha animal the third pressing.
23.7.17	At the third pressing they instituted the Pitryajna.
23.7.18	At the third pressing they offered to Tryambaka.
23.7.19	The Asuras, as they were fleeing, said:
23.7.20	"They have not deceived us."
23.7.21	That is why the Adhvara is called Adhvara.
23.7.22	Then the gods became victorious,
23.7.23	and the Asuras were defeated.
23.7.24	He who knows this and initiates, and he who initiates him knowing this, becomes superior to his enemy.
23.8.1	They go to the heavenly world by means of the Prayaniya (Satra).
23.8.2	That is the reason for the Prayaniya being called Prayaniya.
23.8.3	One who goes to the other world is cut off from this world.
23.8.4	The rising of the sun is the Prayaniya.
23.8.5	He stands firm in this very world.
23.8.6	The gods, having defeated the Asuras, and being desirous of the possession of the Vairājas, deluded the directions, thinking, 'Let no one else know this.'
23.8.7	They say, 'The gods were called Sadhyas before the gods.
23.8.8	Having deluded the directions, they went to heaven.
23.8.9	No one else in this world knows this.
23.8.10	These lower gods sought to know this.
23.8.11	They did not know it.
23.8.12	Sādati said, "I choose the boon."
23.8.13	"I will proclaim these directions."
23.8.14	"The sacrifice is mine, the rising is mine."
23.8.15	Therefore the Āditya is the Prāyaṇīya (rite).
23.8.16-25	The Sun is to be worshipped at sunrise. For this is the circle of the Sun. He said, "One should worship the auspicious Pathya." "By that you will know the eastern direction." He said, "One should worship Agni." By that the southern direction. He said "One should worship Soma." By that, the western direction. He (Agni) said, "One should worship Savitar." By that direction, the northern direction.
23.8.26-31	"I alone know both these worlds." This is Aditi. Her upward direction. By that he went to the heavenly world. These are the deities worshipped for the establishment of the directions and the knowledge of the heavenly world. The gods knew the eastern direction by the path of welfare.
23.8.32	Agni and Soma have seen the truth.
23.8.33	Savitar has bestowed it.
23.8.34	This is Aditi.
23.8.35	On her they spread the sacrifice, facing east.
23.8.36	The Pravargya is indeed the mouth of the sacrifice.
23.8.37	The Pathya and the Svästi are the mouth of the Pathya.
23.8.38	When one offers the Pathya and the Svasti, one gathers speech.
23.8.39	The Prāṇāpāna (breaths) are indeed Agni and Soma. He offers them to Agni and Soma for the sake of prosperity.
23.8.40	This is Savitr, this is Aditi.
23.8.41	He offers the mouth of sacrifice on this (earth).
23.8.42	The Prayaniya (Sutra) is offered for the sake of completion.
23.8.43	The Maruts are the divine classes.
23.8.44	When the divine classes are being completed, the human classes follow.
23.8.45	The verse of the Marutvatya (hymn) is, "O Maruts, ye who bestow prosperity, ye who bestow wealth, ye who bestow happiness, ye who bestow food, ye who bestow cattle, ye who bestow strength, ye who bestow fame, ye who bestow heaven, ye who bestow the world of heaven, ye who are the bestowers of all good things, ye who bestow all good things, may ye bestow on us all good things."
23.8.46	He makes the gods' portion.
23.8.47	He makes the human portion in accordance with the gods' portion
23.8.48	He offers the Pathya Svāsti.
23.8.49	Therefore the sun rises without interruption in the east.
23.8.50	It sets in the west.
23.8.51	For he moves along the path of the auspicious.
23.8.52	He sacrifices to Agni.
23.8.53	Therefore, the plants that are being cooked come from the south.
23.8.54	For plants belong to Agni.
23.8.55	He sacrifices Soma.
23.8.56	Therefore, most of the waters flow from the west.
23.8.57	For the waters belong to Soma.
23.8.58	He sacrifices Savitar.
23.8.59	Therefore it blows most from the north.
23.8.60	It blows, being impelled by Savitr.
23.8.61	He offers to Aditi.
23.8.62	Therefore it rains above the creatures.
23.8.63	He offers five deities.
23.8.64	The sacrifice is fivefold.
23.8.65	He indeed wins the sacrifice.
23.8.66	He offers the sixth to Agni.
23.8.67	There are six seasons.
23.8.68	He stands firm in the seasons.
23.8.69	There are ten Yajus and Anuvakya verses.
23.8.70	The Viraj has ten syllables.
23.8.71	Food is Viraj.
23.8.72	He stands firm in food through Viraj.
23.8.73	The twelfth verse is at the Svistakrt offering.
23.8.74	The year has twelve months. For the attainment of the year.
23.8.75	There are seventeen Samidheni verses.
23.8.76	The year is seventeenfold.
23.8.77	The five seasons and the twelve months are indeed this year.
23.8.78	He makes the mouth of the sacrifice out of the year itself.
23.9.1	He offers the Pathya and Svashti.
23.9.2	Pathya and Svashthi are indeed speech.
23.9.3	He thus unites speech with himself.
23.9.4	He offers to Agni.
23.9.5	Whatever is dry and liable to be burnt by fire, he unites with that.
23.9.6	He offers to Soma.
23.9.7	Whatever is moist in his body, which is not to be burnt by fire, that he touches with it.
23.9.8	Savitar is for the sake of prosperity.
23.9.9	Aditi is for the sake stability.
23.9.10	They proceed with the path and prosperity.
23.9.11	They rise with the path and prosperit.
23.9.12	The path and prosperity is speech.
23.9.13	They proceed by means of speech.
23.9.14	They rise by means of speech.
23.9.15-21	The Pravargya rite is dedicated to the sun. The Udayaniya rite is dedicated to sun. He stands firm in this world and the other world through the mouth of sacrifice. The directions are indeed the heavenly world. These are the directions dedicated to the gods. When one performs the Pravargya rite, one stands firm in the directions and the heavenly world. The sacrifice moves forward as the fire moves forward.
23.9.22	The Pravargya rite is performed in honour of the sun, the Udayaniya rite is performed in honor of the sun.
23.9.23	He thus binds the two ends of the year for firmness and non-slipping.
23.9.24	The Pravargya rite has the Anuvākyā verses, the Udayanīya rite has the Yājyā verses.
23.9.25	The Yājyāverses are the Anuvāka verses.
23.9.26	They go by the same path by which they have come, for the purpose of returning and recognition.
23.9.27	One should omit the yajya and anu-yajya for the one whom one hates.
23.9.28	He is driven away from this world.
23.9.29	He does not reach him.
23.9.30	It is as if he rises from the path.
23.9.31	He cuts him off on both sides.
23.9.32	The Pravargya should be without the Anuyaja.
23.9.33	The Udayaniya should be without the Praja.
23.9.34	The oblation is the same for continuity.
23.9.35	The Praja are the self.
23.9.36	The Prajānuyājas (offerings to the progeny) are (performed).
23.9.37	If one were to do so, he would obstruct himself and his progeny. The progeny would perish.
23.9.38	The Prajās should be accompanied by the Anuyājas.
23.9.39	The oblation is common.
23.9.40	The deity is common.
23.9.41	There is a common ladle.
23.9.42	By that he extends the sacrifice.
23.9.43	He does not obstruct himself or his progeny.
23.9.44-50	They discuss whether or not it should be established. The sacrifice flows away when it is not established. The sacrificer follows the flowing one and flows away with offspring and cattle. It should be established. But one should not offer to the wife. She is impure, not purified. She is not powerful enough to go to the heavenly world.
23.9.51	He performs the Udayaniya sacrifice.
23.9.52	Just as a traveller returns to his home, so the sacrificer, through his wife, stands firm in this world.
23.9.53	For those who perform sacrifices eat the food of the initiated.
23.9.54	But they do not become more prosperous.
23.9.55	For when one performs the Prayaniya sacrifice, one is then initiated.
23.9.56	Then, when the sun rises from the Avabhṛtha, one is initiated.
23.9.57	One performs the Udayaniya (rite) after the Prāyaniya (rite).
23.9.58	One should not eat at the Udayaniya rite itself.
23.9.59	One makes the food of the initiated ones go around.
23.9.60	One becomes more prosperous.
23.10.1	Kadru and Suparni competed for their own forms.
23.10.2	Kadru conquered Suparni's form.
23.10.3	This is indeed Kadru.
23.10.4	The sky is Suparni.
23.10.5	The metres are the Suparnas.
23.10.6	Kadru said to Suparni,
23.10.7	"Bring Soma from the third heaven.
23.10.8	With that redeem yourself."
23.10.9	Suparni said to the metres,
23.10.10	"Indeed, the parents have given their sons to him.
23.10.11	May I not touch such (things).
23.10.12	May I not buy them from here."
23.10.13	She fell down in the world, being fourteen syllables.
23.10.14	Having reached it, she turned back.
23.10.15	Two syllables of her were lost.
23.10.16	She fell down taking cattle and initiation.
23.10.17	Therefore one approaches initiation with cattle.
23.10.18	Therefore they say, "The Jagati is the most cattle-yielding of the metres."
23.10.19	She, being the Tristubh, flew up with thirteen syllables.
23.10.20	Having reached, she returned.
23.10.21	Two syllables of her were lost.
23.10.22	She flew up taking Dakshina and Tapas.
23.10.23	Therefore, from the Tristubh world, Dakshina is taken.
23.10.24	This indeed is Tapas, that one gives one's own.
23.10.25	Therefore they say that the midday pressing is the most austere of the pressings.
23.10.26	She, the Gāyatrī, fell down with four syllables.
23.10.27	She fell down with Karna-Grihya.
23.10.28	She fell on him.
23.10.29	That is the reason for the name of the goat.
23.10.30	She took the four syllables and Soma and fell down.
23.10.31	She became eight-syllabled.
23.10.32	The Brahmanas say:
23.10.33	Why did the Gāyatrī, the smallest of the metres, enter the mouth of the sacrifice?
23.10.34	Why is it the most brilliant?
23.10.35	Because it brought the Soma, therefore the Gāyatṛ is the mouth of the Yajña, and therefore it is the most brilliant.
23.10.36	It brought two Savanas with the lotus, and the third with the mouth.
23.10.37	What it brought with the mouth, that it studied.
23.10.38	Therefore the two Savanas are like a mother, and the third Savana is like her child.
23.10.39	Therefore they sprinkle the third Savana with the Rijiṣa.
23.10.40	When they pour down the third Savana,
23.10.41	they think that they are gathering the third Savana.
24.1.1	One should not buy with a black-eyed, black-haired, black-hoofed cow.
24.1.2	This is the one that has been defeated and crushed.
24.1.3	It is dedicated to the Pitrs.
24.1.4	One who is dying should use it.
24.1.5	One should not buy with the one that has two forms.
24.1.6	It is the one that defeats Vritra.
24.1.7	One wins or is defeated.
24.1.8	One should buy with the one of the king.
24.1.9	There is no one between him.
24.1.10	One wins, or is defeated.
24.1.11	One should buy the Soma with the Yaadhaalo-dharkarni (verse).
24.1.12	This is an excess of forms.
24.1.13	The Sodashin (verse) is an excess.
24.1.14	One obtains an excess with an excess.
24.1.15	 One should buy the soma with the Babhru-Ekahāyanī (verse).
24.1.16	The Soma-purchasing verse is speech.
24.1.17	Man is speech.
24.1.18	Because he buys it with a single-year-old (animal), therefore a man of one year speaks.
24.1.19	Because he buys it with an older (animal), therefore he speaks more.
24.1.20	The metres brought Soma from this world. Gāyatrī became a hawk.
24.1.21	The Gandharvas surrounded him in between. Viśvāvasu.
24.1.22	He stayed for three nights as a captive.
24.1.23	Therefore, Soma stays for three nights after being bought.
24.1.24	The gods again requested him.
24.1.25	They did not give him back to them.
24.1.26	They said, "We will redeem him with a cow."
24.1.27	They thought, "We will sell him at a sacrifice, since we are redeeming him with a cow.
24.1.28	They said, "The Gandharvas, being desirous of women, created a woman by means of magic."
24.1.29	They thought, "We have created offspring by means of speech."
24.1.30	They were distressed.
24.1.31	"Our Soma, our Soma-purchasing!"
24.1.32	The Gandharvas said, "We shall lament."
24.1.33	Those Brahmins and Gandharvas spoke.
24.1.34	The gods sang.
24.1.35	She returned to the gods who were singing.
24.1.36	Therefore a woman desires one who sings,
24.1.37	not one who speaks Brahman.
24.1.38	For she returned to Brahman, not to harm.
24.1.39	Therefore they say, "Soma is not bought, there is no buying of Soma,"
24.1.40	for she returns to the gods.
24.1.41	They said, "The Gandharvas are desirous of women."
24.1.42	"There are many who have intercourse with the Gandharvas and become pregnant."
24.1.43	"Having entered the water, one should say, 'I am coming out."
24.1.44	"What was her discarded and ground-up remains became the Jaratī Kūṭā and emerged."
24.1.45	They said, "This is the deity of the fathers."
24.1.46	Therefore, they offer her to the fathers.
24.1.47	They said, "Come in and speak again."
24.1.48	She, the cow, the destroyer of Vritra, having become twofold, spoke.
24.1.49	She touched him with that form.
24.1.50	Therefore, she is the best.
24.1.51	Another is better.
24.1.52	He who, knowing this, chooses the best, the best does not harm him.
24.1.53	They said, "Come back in and speak again."
24.1.54	She became the one-day (cow) and went away.
24.1.55	With her they bought (the Soma).
24.1.56	Therefore she is the Soma-purchasing cow.
24.1.57	That is her form.
24.2.1	The third pressing is to be obtained with the Soma-purchaser.
24.2.2	The third press is indeed cattle.
24.2.3	When one buys with a cow, then one obtains the third press.
24.2.4	One measures on a red skin.
24.2.5	Therefore, cattle are mostly of the color of the red.
24.2.6	One should not sell it after having thought about it.
24.2.7	One should be a spectator when it is being sold.
24.2.8	Soma is the king of plants.
24.2.9	He throws out what has been swallowed.
24.2.10	He becomes greedy.
24.2.11	Therefore, the seller of Soma becomes greedy.
24.2.12	He buys it at the end of the water.
24.2.13	He buys him only in the form of water.
24.2.14	He buys with gold.
24.2.15	He buys him with brilliance.
24.2.16	He buys with a goat.
24.2.17	He buys it with brilliance.
24.2.18	One buys with a cow.
24.2.19	He buys her with a mouth.
24.2.20	One buys a bull.
24.2.21	He buys the fire of the sacrifice.
24.2.22	One buys (it) with a calf and a heifer.
24.2.23	He buys it with a pair.
24.2.24	He buys it with a bull.
24.2.25	He buys him with Indra.
24.2.26	They say, "He who buys with a bull buys with Prajapati."
24.2.27	If there is any bull that is impotent, one should buy with it.
24.2.28	With that he buys him with Indra,
24.2.29	he does not buy with Prajapati.
24.2.30	He buys with ten (coins).
24.2.31	The Viraj has ten syllables.
24.2.32	Food is Viraj.
24.2.33	One indeed stands firm in food through Viraj.
24.3.1	"Thou art the swift one."
24.3.2	The Soma-purchasing cow is speech.
24.3.3	For speech moves hither and thither.
24.3.4	He offers the Soma-purchasing (cow) while seeing.
24.3.5	The Soma-purchaing (cow) is speech.
24.3.6	He gives it to her while seeing.
24.3.7	"Held in the mind."
24.3.8	For the mind indeed is restrained by speech.
24.3.9	"It is pleasing to Vishnu."
24.3.10	Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
24.3.11	He makes it pleasing to the sacrifice.
24.3.12	"At her impulse, may you attain the instrument of her body, O Truth-Savitar, Svāhā."
24.3.13	He who attains the instrument of her form becomes so.
24.3.14	He attains the instrument of his form only with the impulse of Savitar.
24.3.15	He offers it with the word "svāhā".
24.3.16	Having addressed the sun, one should buy Soma.
24.3.17	Having addressed the Sun, one buys Soma, saying, "O god Sun, we are buying Soma."
24.3.18	"You are the mind."
24.3.19	Soma-buying is speech.
24.3.20	It instructs her.
24.3.21	Therefore, offspring are born from the remaining (parts).
24.3.22	"You are mind."
24.3.23	The speech is held by the mind.
24.3.24	You are firm.
24.3.25	The speech thinks thus and thus.
24.3.26	You are the southern.
24.3.27	This is the southern.
24.3.28	You are fit for sacrifice.
24.3.29	This is fit for sacrifice. 
24.3.30	You are the warrior.
24.3.31	This is a warrior.
24.3.32	And he who is favoured by this becomes a warrior.
24.3.33	Aditi is on both sides of the head.
24.3.34	For Aditi is on the two sides of the head,
24.3.35	for she is on both sides the overlord of the sacrifice.
24.3.36	The Pravargya rite is dedicated to Aditya.
24.3.37	The Udayaniya rite is dedicated to the sun.
24.3.38	May I be well-risen and well-set, he says; he makes her well-risen and wel-set.
24.3.39	"May Mitra bind thee to the place."
24.3.40	If it were bound to the place, it would be connected with the Fathers.
24.3.41	The Soma-purchasing is speech.
24.3.42	The noose is Varuna's.
24.3.43	Speech, seized by Varuna, should not speak.
24.3.44	If it were seized by the ear, it would be the slayer of Vritra.
24.3.45	If it is not seized.
24.3.46	"May Mitra bind thee on the place."
24.3.47	Brahma indeed is Mitra.
24.3.48	He binds him on the foot with Brahma alone.
24.3.49	"May Pūṣan protect us on the way."
24.3.50	This indeed is Pūṣan.
24.3.51	He gives her to her alone.
24.3.52	"To Indra, the overlord."
24.3.53	Indra indeed is the most powerful among the gods.
24.3.54	He makes him the overlord of her.
24.3.55	"May your mother and father be pleased with you."
24.3.56	And the father and mother are the approvers.
24.3.57	"She offers to the god, saying, 'To Indra the Soma.'
24.3.58	"For she is a goddess, and offers to a god.
24.3.59	"He says, 'May Rudra turn thee to Indra the Soma.' "
24.3.60	Rudra is the most impetuous of the gods.
24.3.61	He makes her belong to him beyond, and the others to the portion.
24.3.62	"Mayst thou return safely with thy Soma friend."
24.3.63	He again makes the auspicious offering to her when she has turned around.
24.4.1	He goes forward with his right foot and the right feet of the others.
24.4.2	Therefore the right half of the body is more vigorous.
24.4.3	He goes six steps forward.
24.4.4	There are six seasons.
24.4.5	He stands in the seasons.
24.4.6	There are the six backs.
24.4.7	He obtains them.
24.4.8	He takes the seventh step.
24.4.9	Seven are the domestic animals.
24.4.10	He wins them.
24.4.11	Speech speaks seven times.
24.4.12	He wins it.
24.4.13	"He says, "You are Vasa, you are Rudra."
24.4.14	He approaches these names of the gods.
24.4.15	"He means to say, "You are this, you are this."
24.4.16	Whatever happens, then this is indeed the right utterance.
24.4.17	May Brihaspati delight you in good fortune.
24.4.18	Rudra with the Vasus has come.
24.4.19	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman.
24.4.20	Rudra is the most powerful of the gods.
24.4.21	He places it at the end with those two who are the most powerful among the gods.
24.4.22	I anoint thee on the head of the earth, for the worship of the gods.
24.4.23	For this is the head of the Earth, namely the place of worship.
24.4.24	On the place of Ida, rich in ghee, svāhā.
24.4.25	This is indeed Ida, and this is her place rich in ghee.
24.4.26	He offers it with the formula "svāhā" only.
24.4.27	I cut off the neck of the Rakshas.
24.4.28	The Rakshas is the enemy.
24.4.29	He cuts off the neck of the enemy.
24.4.30	With the wooden sword he draws a line.
24.4.31	The wooden sword is the thunderbolt.
24.4.32	The line is the cattle.
24.4.33	With the thunderbolt he encloses the cattle for him.
24.4.34	He should draw the line as far as the ghee flows.
24.4.35	Cattle is ghee.
24.4.36	He indeed encloses the cattle.
24.4.37	He pours the oblation into the vessel.
24.4.38	Cattle are the Adityas.
24.4.39	Earth is Aditi.
24.4.40	The vessel is filled from earth.
24.4.41	He places them in their own womb.
24.4.42	"May you delight in us, may your wealth be with us."
24.4.43	If he were to say, "May your wealth be with me," he would give away cattle to the other (party). The Adhvaryu would become without cattle.
24.4.44	"May my wealth be with you."
24.4.45	He offers the animals to himself.
24.4.46	The offering that is made in a fireless place is not proper.
24.4.47	When one makes an offering after placing gold, one makes an offering to Agni, for prosperity.
24.4.48	One makes this offering in a fireless (place).
24.4.49	The powerful demons, having followed it, destroy it.
24.4.50	When he pours out water, it is for peace and to remove the demons.
24.4.51	He puts the animals in a clean place.
24.4.52	When he brings the animals to the place of the trench.
24.4.53	When he pours out water (for them), he releases the animals from the unclean place.
24.4.54	He makes the wife count the Soma-purchasing money.
24.4.55	This is the wife's participation in the sacrifice.
24.4.56	Then indeed he places the pair at the mouth of the sacrifice for procreation.
24.4.57	"He makes you known to Tvashtri."
24.4.58	For from here these creatures are born for procreation. For procreation.
24.5.1	Having placed gold in his hand, he measures.
24.5.2	Gold is truth.
24.5.3	He measures it with truth.
24.5.4	Gold is immortality.
24.5.5	He measures with immortality.
24.5.6	"He is ours."
24.5.7	He makes it his own.
24.5.8	"Your Graha is bright."
24.5.9	He takes it as bright.
24.5.10	"He presses him, the god Savitar."
24.5.11	He presses him with the deities that are impelled by Savitar.
24.5.12	He presses him by the Atichandas metre.
24.5.13	The Atichandas is the armour of the metres.
24.5.14	He makes them reach the same size as the sacrifice and the sacrificer.
24.5.15	He measures with each one separately.
24.5.16	He attains their powers.
24.5.17	Therefore we bend them and stretch them as we please.
24.5.18	If he were to measure them all together, he would attain their power.
24.5.19	He measures them back with the thumb.
24.5.20	Therefore this is their power.
24.5.21	He should let it go up.
24.5.22	He should not put it down.
24.5.23	If he were to put it down, he would make a noose, and Varuna would be the noose, and he would be caught by Varuna.
24.5.24	When he lets it go, he frees himself from Varuna's noose.
24.5.25	He measures twice.
24.5.26	There are two Soma-pressings for the Sukriya.
24.5.27	He measures ten times.
24.5.28	The Viraj has ten syllables.
24.5.29	The Viraja is food.
24.5.30	He stands firm in the food of Viraj.
24.5.31	If one were to measure what is limited, one's life would be limited.
24.5.32	One measures what is unlimited.
24.5.33	Therefore, this life is unlimited.
24.5.34	If one measures what is limited, it would belong to the sacrificer alone.
24.5.35	One measures the unlimited.
24.5.36	It is also done for the participants.
24.5.37	"For the creatures, for the creatures you are."
24.5.38	The parts are the creatures.
24.5.39	He places the breath in the creatures.
24.5.40	There is ghee taken in four mouthfuls.
24.5.41	Animals have four feet.
24.5.42	He takes animals for him.
24.5.43	Animals are of this form.
24.5.44	Ghee is of that form. He obtains animals of the same form.
24.5.45	This is your bright body, this is your lustre. He puts the gold in ghee.
24.5.46	This is indeed Agni's dear body, namely ghee.
24.5.47	Gold is splendour.
24.5.48	He thus makes his dear body flourish with splendour.
24.5.49	Gold is semen.
24.5.50	Ghee is cattle.
24.5.51	When he puts the gold into the ghee, he puts the seed into the animals.
24.5.52	Therefore from the seed which is not made of bones, the embryos are born with bones.
24.5.53	He puts it on having bound it, for the holding of the embryos and for their not being aborted.
24.5.54	He binds the Niṣṭarkya.
24.5.55	From that womb the embryos are released.
24.5.56	If one were to bind it without the Anīrūpa-rite, the embryos would not be released from the womb.
24.5.57	One places it with a Yajus-formula.
24.5.58	One takes it up with a Yajush-formula.
24.5.59	It is yoked with a Yajuh-formula.
24.5.60	Released with a Yajur-formula.
24.5.61	Therefore offspring are born from the semen deposited in the opposite direction.
24.6.1	One should not place the foot on the previous step.
24.6.2	This is the offering of the gods whose oblations have been burnt.
24.6.3	Rudra is Agni.
24.6.4	Animals are the place.
24.6.5	One should offer animals to Rudra.
24.6.6	One would become without animals.
24.6.7	One offers the oblation at the Garhapatya.
24.6.8	Animals stand near the Garhapaty.
24.6.9	This is the womb of animals.
24.6.10	One places them in their own womb.
24.6.11	One should make the offering where there is peace, as if there are no embers, for peace and non-burning.
24.6.12	"I buy Soma from you."
24.6.13	He thus proclaims the king Soma's virtues and greatness.
24.6.14	One should not bargain for Soma.
24.6.15	If one bargains for Soma, one diminishes the king Soma' s power.
24.6.16	One proclaims the sacrificer's power.
24.6.17	One becomes a beggar.
24.6.18	One should say, "This is it."
24.6.19	This is its self, this is its form, this is its progeny, this is its milk.
24.6.20	He does not exceed the power of King Soma.
24.6.21	He does not exceed the path of the sacrificer.
24.6.22	He becomes free from disease.
24.6.23	"He says, "I buy your bright (Soma) with bright (Soma), your moon with moon, your nectar with nectar."
24.6.24	He buys his bright (Soma) by means of bright (Soma).
24.6.25	"He says "Your moon with moon, nectar with nectar, your power with power, your cow with our cow, your Chandrani."
24.6.26	His own strength alone supports him.
24.6.27	With that strengthless being he sells.
24.6.28	"You are the body of Tapas (penance)."
24.6.29	For this is the body of Tapas.
24.6.30	"You belong to the color of Prajapati."
24.6.31	Agni is indeed Prajapati.
24.6.32	The goats are born from Agni.
24.6.33	"They are growing the thousand-nourishing."
24.6.34	For this is the thousandfold nourishment of cattle.
24.6.35	From this she produces three, or two.
24.6.36	"One buys with the supreme animal, saying, 'This is the supreme animal.'
24.6.37	For this is the supreme animal among cattle.
24.6.38	'May they be your kinsmen,' he says.
24.6.39	He places his own strength in her.
24.6.40	With her, having become powerless, one sells.
24.6.41	The metres brought Soma from the other world.
24.6.42	It was obstructed by darkness.
24.6.43	The Gayatri, the Victorious, fell from the light.
24.6.44	It announced to him.
24.6.45	Now indeed he is brought from that (other world) when he is bought.
24.6.46	Darkness is between this (world) and that.
24.6.47	When he buys with the Victorious (metre), he announces it to him.
24.6.48	"Come, O Mitra, to thy friend!"
24.6.49	He approaches the sacrificer in the form of Varuna.
24.6.50	He makes him a friend.
24.6.51	He approaches.
24.6.52	Just as the inferior approaches the superior, so does he.
24.6.53	"Enter the right thigh of Indra."
24.6.54	Indra placed him on his right thigh.
24.6.55	The sacrificer is connected with Indra.
24.6.56	He places him in his own womb.
24.6.57	"He says, "Your own, O Brāhmaṇa!"
24.6.58	He directs the Soma-purchasing (cows) towards the east.
24.6.59	These Gandharvas protected him in this world.
24.6.60	She brought him with the Gayatri (verse).
24.6.61	The Hotṛ and the Potrā (recite) in front of the Go-pītha.
24.6.62	Therefore, when these two are not employed, the Soma is not drunk.
24.6.63	Therefore, one should not be a Neṣṭra or a Potra.
24.6.64	Therefore, these two are like those who are engaged in sacrifice.
24.6.65	These follow him.
24.6.66	These Gandharvas take away his prosperity.
24.6.67	Therefore, the seller of Soma does not prosper.
24.6.68	If he were to go to the Kṛcchra, he would take it away.
24.6.69	For this is bought from these Gandharvas.
24.6.70	"For life" as in the text.
24.6.71	"Go to the expanse of the sky."
24.6.72	For this is now dedicated to the sky-god.
24.6.73	"We have reached the path."
24.6.74	Now indeed the demons follow him,
24.6.75	having fallen from here,
24.6.76	not yet reached there.
24.6.77	He goes, indeed, avoiding the demons.
24.6.78	They go without the leader.
24.6.79-86	They go to the greatness of this (Soma). They carry it with the Anas (i.e. the Soma-carrying vessels). Therefore, the plants are cooked in the Anas. If they were to carry it with the head, the plants would be cooked with the head. You are the skin of Aditi. You sit in the abode of Aditi. The sun is Soma, Aditi is the earth. The Anas is collected from the earth.
24.6.87	He places him in his own womb.
24.6.88	Soma is indeed Varuna.
24.6.89	He makes him deficient in his deity when he makes him a friend.
24.6.90	When he settles him with Varuna, he makes him deficient in the deity himself.
24.6.91	He spreads the sky in the forests.
24.6.92	He binds him with a garment.
24.6.93	The garment is of all deities.
24.6.94	He thus makes him prosper with all the deities.
24.6.95	"He mounts the eye of the sun."
24.6.96	They spread the black antelope skin in front.
24.6.97	Now indeed, the Rakshas are desirous of injuring him who is ascending to the heavenly world.
24.6.98	The sun is the path which is not to be transcended.
24.6.99	He thus makes him ascend it for the attainment of the heavenly world.
24.7.1	"Do thou fall away, O Lord of the world."
24.7.2	For he is the lord of beings.
24.7.3	"All the abodes."
24.7.4	The divine abodes are all.
24.7.5	He indeed makes him fall away towards the divine abodes.
24.7.6	"Having become a hawk, do thou fall away."
24.7.7	The hawk is the swiftest of birds.
24.7.8	Having made him a hawk, he lets loose the Rakshas.
24.7.9	"May it be prepared in the house of the sacrificer."
24.7.10	He makes him (the sacrificer) his own house.
24.7.11	And he makes the gods prepare it in the house of his own sacrificer.
24.7.12	"Salutation to Mitra and Varuna, the seer."
24.7.13	He, having become Varuna, approaches the sacrificer.
24.7.14	He makes him his own friend.
24.7.15	They take up the seat.
24.7.16	Just as when a human king is present, they take up his standard, so also this.
24.7.17	He stands firm with Agni.
24.7.18	Agni is all the deities.
24.7.19	He stands firmly with the deities.
24.7.20	Agni and Soma are now approaching the sacrificer.
24.7.21	When he stands firm with the animal, he places him in between them.
24.7.22	Now, he who consecrates himself, offers himself to Agni and Soma.
24.7.23	When he offers a beast, he redeems himself by it.
24.7.24	If one has a beard and hair, the form of the two gods, and is hairy and tawny, one should offer him in the form of a man.
24.7.25	He who eats him eats a man.
24.7.26	Therefore, one should not eat him.
24.7.27	The initiated one is hungry.
24.7.28	This hunger is redeemed by the animal.
24.7.29	He who eats it becomes hungry.
24.7.30	Therefore, one should not eat it.
24.7.31	Indra killed Vritra with the strength of Agni and Soma.
24.7.32	This animal, which is the slayer of Vritra, is offered for victory.
24.7.33	Therefore, it should be eaten.
24.7.34	The gods, when he was about to be offered on the previous day, did not approach him.
24.7.35	"We will avert him from the other sacrifice."
24.7.36	Agni and Soma alone approached him.
24.7.37	The others went away from the sacrifice.
24.7.38	Therefore this (animal) is offered to Agni and Soma.
24.7.39	Therefore, the Graha is not taken for Agni and Soma.
24.7.40	When those two were returning to the gods, they placed their beloved abode.
24.7.41	The gods sought to follow it.
24.7.42	They went to Prābhūti.
24.7.43	They said, "This is a new creation."
24.7.44	What is new, that is the newness of butter.
24.7.45	What is melted, that is the meltedness of ghee.
24.7.46	What the goat found, that is the oiliness of oil.
24.7.47	He made it ghee.
24.7.48	That is the ghee-ness of ghee. 
24.7.49	Therefore the goat moves with a ghee-making sound.
24.7.50	They followed the animals.
24.7.51	The cattle brought it together.
24.7.52	Through this they are born from the cattle.
24.7.53	They said, "We will choose the sacrifice."
24.7.54	"This alone shall be our share, he who knows our dear abode."
24.7.55	Therefore this is offered to Agni-Soma.
24.7.56	Therefore one should eat of it.
24.7.57	For it is chosen by the sacrifice.
24.8.1	One who is released is one thing, one who is not released is another.
24.8.2	Now the hospitality is described for the continuity of the sacrifice without interruption.
24.8.3	If both were released, the offering would be dedicated to the ancestors and the gods.
24.8.4	The sacrifice is interrupted, not continuous, not bound.
24.8.5	If the two are not released, the offering to Vārtraghna would be uninterrupted, the sacrifice would be uninterrupted, and would be secured.
24.8.6	If one is released and another is not released,
24.8.7	The offering to Vātraghna becomes the offering to the father-deity.
24.8.8	The sacrifice is uninterrupted, and is secured.
24.8.9	Having made his wife take the first portion, he offers.
24.8.10	The wife is the mistress of the Parinahan.
24.8.11	He offers the oblation to the gods, having obtained the consent of the wife.
24.8.12	This is the wife's share in the sacrifice.
24.8.13	And he places the pair at the mouth of the sacrifice for procreation.
24.8.14	All those who follow the merit, to all of them hospitality is offered.
24.8.15	The metres follow the king Soma when bought.
24.8.16	"This is Agni's body, to Vishnu thee." This is the Gāyatrī verse.
24.8.17	"This (verse) is Soma's body, for Vishnu thee." This (verse) is the Tristubh metre.
24.8.18	For the guest, for hospitality, for Vishnu, thee! This he pours out for the Jagati.
24.8.19	For Agni, for thee, for the giver of wealth and prosperity, for Vishnu, for thee! This he puts out for the Anushtubh.
24.8.20	For the hawk, for thee, the bearer of Soma, for Vishnu, this he pours out for Gayatri.
24.8.21	Gayatri brought him from that world.
24.8.22	Therefore she is again in the Yamuna.
24.8.23	Therefore it is again employed.
24.8.24	He offers with the metres; he makes the metres have a share.
24.8.25	He offers five times.
24.8.26	The sacrifice is fivefold.
24.8.27	He indeed wins the sacrifice.
24.8.28	"To Vishnu thee, to Vishnu thee."
24.8.29	Vishnu indeed is the sacrifice now, when it is not yet named.
24.8.30-37	Therefore, the cake is for Vishnu. It should be made with three potsherds. For that is for Vishnu. If it is made with nine potsherds, then it is made with three potshers. For three are the three potsherds, and nine is the nine potsherds. There are nine breaths. He goes to the mouth of the sacrifice with the breaths. And he also places the three-fold brilliance in the mouth of the sacrificer.
24.8.38	The one with three skulls is the one for Vishnu.
24.8.39	The one with six is the one for the Vedas. The one for both is the one for both.
24.8.40	They say, "The animal to be sacrificed is for Soma, the king."
24.8.41	"Indeed, the animal to be sacrificed was for a human king."
24.8.42	They churn Agni.
24.8.43	Animals are for Agni.
24.8.44	He offers that very animal to him.
24.8.45	Agni is all the deities.
24.8.46	All the deities generate Soma and the Chandas coming to him.
24.8.47	The arrangement is of Ashvala.
24.8.48	The two Udyavas are of Akshava.
24.8.49	Prajapati was like a horse.
24.8.50	His hair was like the hair of a horse.
24.8.51	The two arms are the Udyavas.
24.8.52	The gods, having united with him, went to heaven.
24.8.53	The Aśvālā is the spreading.
24.8.54	The Aśvālā are the two Udyavas.
24.8.55	He approaches Prajapati for the attainment of the heavenly world.
24.8.56	The Ašvālā are the wings of Prajapati.
24.8.57	The Aṣvālā is the spread, he makes the mouth of the sacrifice for Prajapati. The gods were attacked by the Rākṣasas.
24.8.58	The gods were attacked by Rākṣasas.
24.8.59	They strike them with the Karshmarya (wood).
24.8.60	Because the enclosing sticks are made of Karshmarya wood, for the removal of Rakshas.
24.8.61	Whatever the gods did with this, they succeeded.
24.8.62	That is the efficacy of his rite.
24.8.63	This is indeed the name of the one who is efficacious.
24.8.64	One succeeds with this at the very mouth of the sacrifice.
24.8.65	There are seventeen kindling verses.
24.8.66	The year consists of seventeen parts, five seasons, and twelve months.
24.8.67	This indeed is the year.
24.8.68	He prepares the mouth of the sacrifice from the year itself.
24.8.69	The Atithya is indeed the head of the sacrifice.
24.8.70	The Upasads are the neck.
24.8.71	If one were to establish (the sacrificial post) at the beginning, one would establish the sacrifice from the head. The head would be cut off from the neck of the sacrifice.
24.8.72	It ends with the syllable 'i'.
24.8.73	He places the head in the neck of the sacrifice.
24.8.74	It has nine potsherds.
24.8.75	From that the head of a man is spread out in nine ways.
24.8.76	The Upasads are the subsequent offerings, the Tanunaptra is the blessing.
24.8.77	Therefore it is without subsequent offerings.
24.9.1	The gods did not stand for supremacy over one another.
24.9.2	They went forth in four directions: Agni with the Vasus, Soma with the Rudras, Indra with the Maruts, Varuna with the Adityas.
24.9.3	Those gods became inferior, the Asuras became superior.
24.9.4	They knew: 'Those who are inferior become superior, the Asuras.'
24.9.5	They united their bodies in friendship.
24.9.6	They said, "He who harms one another among us shall not be able to cross over to the other world."
24.9.7	Therefore, one should not harm those who are related to Satãnu and Apãnu.
24.9.8	When one harms, one harms one's own dear body.
24.9.9	When the bodies of the gods and the demons came together, that was the reason for the name "Tãnūnaptra" (one whose body is covered).
24.9.10	Then the gods became victorious.
24.9.11	He becomes superior to his enemies.
24.9.12	He who knows thus and approaches Tanunaptra, becomes superior to his enemy.
24.9.13	The sun is indeed Indra.
24.9.14	They stood for his supremacy.
24.9.15	Those who know thus stand for his supremacy. Those who know thus stand
24.9.16	They placed those forms in him.
24.9.17	Therefore he shines with the greatest brilliance.
24.9.18	Therefore Soma-offerings are mostly dedicated to the Sun-god.
24.9.19	The gods killed Vritra with the thunderbolt of ghee, with the two ladles as arms.
24.9.20	Soma was Vritra.
24.9.21	They indeed kill Soma when they offer it near with ghee.
24.9.22	"O Soma, the god, may you increase with rays."
24.9.23	Whatever they kill and whatever they injure, they nourish that.
24.9.24	Those who nourish Soma go to the other world.
24.9.25	"They go, saying, 'Desiring wealth, we go to Bhaga.'
24.9.26	They stand firm in this world."
24.9.27	He who kills a foetus injures both his father and mother.
24.9.28	Soma, the king, is the foetus of these two.
24.9.29	Obeisance to the sky, obeisance to the earth.
24.9.30	He makes obeisance to them alone.
24.9.31	They say, "What does one obtain by initiation?"
24.9.32	They say, what does one obtain by the intermediate initiation?
24.9.33	One obtains oneself by initiation and offspring by the intermediate initiation.
24.9.34	He puts on the girdle of the Santara.
24.9.35	He approaches the lesser vow.
24.9.36	Therefore, from oneself, offspring is lesser.
24.9.37	He who gives away the best of his possessions to another, he becomes the most excellent one through progeny, through sons and grandsons.
24.9.38	Agni is indeed the initiated one.
24.9.39	The waters pacify Agni.
24.9.40	He sprinkles the intoxicated ones.
24.9.41	He performs the vow of the intoxicated ones for the sake of non-pacification.
24.9.42	For the waters are indeed pacifying.
24.9.43	And he also places more of the brilliance within himself.
24.9.44	One who is initiated should not offer oblations with this (verse).
24.9.45	Agni is Rudra.
24.9.46	He (Agni) assumes the form of Rudra.
24.9.47	One offers oblations with the verse, "O Agni, that form of yours which is Rudra-like."
24.9.48	He offers oblations in his own deity.
24.9.49	Thus his oblation is neither offered nor not offered.
24.10.1	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a fight.
24.10.2	The Asuras had these cities: of iron, silver, and gold.
24.10.3	The gods defeated the Asuras in every battle.
24.10.4	They knew that they had no fixed abode and that was why they were defeated.
24.10.5	They performed these rites in the front: the Havirdhana in heaven, the Agnidhra in the atmosphere, and the Sada in the earth.
24.10.6	They said, "Let us go to the Upasads."
24.10.7	"One wins the great city by the Upasads," they said.
24.10.8	They went to the Upasad.
24.10.9	They conquered these worlds by the Upasad rites.
24.10.10	Therefore they say, "One wins the greatcity by the Upasada rites."
24.10.11	They were expelled from these worlds and entered the seasons.
24.10.12	They became six.
24.10.13	They were expelled from the seasons by means of the Upasads, two from this world, two from the atmosphere, and two from the earth.
24.10.14	They were driven out from the seasons and entered the year.
24.10.15	They became twelve.
24.10.16	Having thus spent a year, they entered the four directions.
24.10.17	Having spent a year, he entered the day and night.
24.10.18	When they came in the evening, they were led by that night.
24.10.19	When in the morning, by that day.
24.10.20	Therefore the cow fills her evening udder in the morning, and her morning udder in the evening.
24.10.21	They came forth from these worlds, driving them away with the Upasads.
24.10.22	Then the gods became (powerful),
24.10.23	the Asuras became (powerful).
24.10.24	He who, knowing this, performs the Upasads, drives away his foe from all these worlds.
24.10.25	He becomes (powerful) by himself.
24.10.26	His enemy is destroyed.
24.10.27	One should not perform twelve (rites) for the Agniṣṭoma.
24.10.28	The Nirṛti rites are not pacifying.
24.10.29	One should perform three (rites) for an Ahīna sacrifice.
24.10.30	The Yajña rite becomes more important afterwards.
24.10.31	One should cut off the neck.
24.10.32	One would incur misfortune.
24.10.33	One should do twelve (rites) to pacify and prevent the Nirṛti rites.
24.10.34	The three Agniṣṭomas are for the purpose of crossing over and for the sake of being together.
24.10.35	The gods could not follow the Asuras in these worlds.
24.10.36	They followed them with Agni as their leader.
24.10.37	The last rites of the Agniṣṭoma are the signs.
24.10.38	Just as the lord of a field follows the field, so does this.
24.10.39	They go conquering these worlds with Agni as their mouth.
24.10.40	He who knows the gods of the Sadhyas, succeeds for him.
24.10.41	These very worlds are the gods of the sadhyas.
24.10.42	For him it is successful.
24.10.43	For him is success.
24.10.44	For him in the yonder world is success.
24.10.45	He who thus knows succeeds for him.
25.1.1	The gods made the arrow, the Upasads, Agni, the point, Soma, the shaft, and Vishnu, the shaft-straightener.
25.1.2	They said, "He who is the strongest among us should let it loose."
25.1.3	They said to Rudra, "You are the strongest among us."
25.1.4	"Let it loose."
25.1.5	He said, "I choose a boon.
25.1.6	I am the lord of cattle."
25.1.7	They thought, "If he becomes the lord of cattle, he will destroy all of them."
25.1.8	They said, "Let him be the lord for seven days, not beyond that."
25.1.9	Therefore, Rudra is the lord of cattle for seven days.
25.1.10	The demons destroy what is beyond that.
25.1.11	He released it.
25.1.12	With that he moves forward.
25.1.13	What moves forward is the Rudra-ness of Rudra.
25.1.14	He releases the creation to his brother. One who knows this and approaches the Upasads,
25.1.15	he should not retreat again.
25.1.16	He who retreats again from the two who are engaged, the other wins.
25.1.17	He who approaches the Upasds is now engaged.
25.1.18	Having gone around once only, he announces (the offering) for the conquest of the sacrifice and for the removal of the Rakshas.
25.1.19	There are no Prayajas or Anuyajas.
25.1.20	The Prayajas and Anuyajas are indeed in front of the sacrifice.
25.1.21	If one were to perform Prayajas and Anujayas, one would perform them in front of the sacrificie.
25.1.22	There would be a great calamity.
25.1.23	One should make a sharp arrow.
25.1.24	It becomes four-fold.
25.1.25	There are four parts in an arrow:
25.1.26	It becomes three-fold.
25.1.27	The arrow has three joints: the tip, the shaft and the feather.
25.1.28	It becomes two-fold.
25.1.29	An arrow has two joints: the tip and the shaft.
25.1.30	It becomes one-fold.
25.1.31	Only one is an arrow.
25.1.32	Having thus prepared the arrow, he releases it on the next day against his enemy.
25.1.33	And he also attains the vow.
25.1.34	The Upasads are indeed the neck of the sacrifice.
25.1.35	There are no Prayajas or Anuyajas.
25.1.36	Therefore, the neck is the most vulnerable part of a man.
25.1.37	They are employed with equal strength.
25.1.38	Therefore the neck, though the smallest, is the most vigorous.
25.1.39	There are three Upasads.
25.1.40	These are the three worlds.
25.1.41	Therefore a man has three parts.
25.1.42	He offers with the Atiṣakta verses.
25.1.43	Therefore the neck is Atiṣakta.
25.1.44	And he offers with the verses that are not too long and not too short.
25.1.45	One should recite the Yajya and Anuvakya verses in the proper order.
25.1.46	If they were to be without the Chandas, the Hotr would be killed.
25.1.47	The stones are for breaking.
25.2.1	The gods and the Asuras were united in the sacrifice.
25.2.2	That sacrifice was afraid, 'Whoever will conquer, they will destroy me.'
25.2.3	It lay down.
25.2.4	The gods sought to conquer it.
25.2.5	They came seeking with their arms stretched out.
25.2.6	Indra went over him again and again.
25.2.7	He said, "Who went over me again and again?"
25.2.8	"I am the one who is in distress."
25.2.9	Then he said, "Who are you?"
25.2.10	"I have brought him out of distress."
25.2.11	He said, this boar is named Emuṣa.
25.2.12	The Asuras, who are on the other side of the twenty-one cities of stone, are standing with that wealth which is on the left. Destroy him who is the slayer in this distress.
25.2.13	Indra, having released him to Dalbhus, struck him down.
25.2.14	He said, "This one is slain. Bring him who is the bringer in this distress."
25.2.15	Vishnu brought it back.
25.2.16	Yajna is Vishnu.
25.2.17	By means of Yajna, he took away their Yajna, animals, animals, power, and power.
25.2.18	Then the gods became victorious.
25.2.19	The Asuras became defeated.
25.2.20	Yajana is Vishnu.
25.2.21	By means of the sacrifice, he conquers his enemy's sacrifice, his enemy's cattle, his enemy' own power.
25.2.22	He becomes one with himself.
25.2.23	His enemy becomes defeated.
25.2.24	They desire the divine sacrifice.
25.2.25	They desire sacrifice itself.
25.2.26	Whatever they obtain, they obtain sacrifice itself.
25.2.27	If the ground slopes towards the east, one should perform sacrifice there, if one desires sacrifice.
25.2.28	For the sacrifice is indeed laid down in this way, for the sake of the knowledge of the sacrifice.
25.2.29	If the ground is level and well-established, one should perform the sacrifice there, if he has lost his prosperity.
25.2.30	For one who has lost his prosperity, prosperity should be sought from this (level ground).
25.2.31	This (level ground) is well-established on the earth.
25.2.32	He indeed wins for him the establishment.
25.2.33	He goes to the establishment.
25.2.34	One who has an enemy should offer on a three-high (altar).
25.2.35	By means of the three-high (sacrifice) Vishnu conquered these worlds.
25.2.36	He drove the Asuras away from these worlds.
25.2.37	One conquers these worlds.
25.2.38	(One) drives away the enemy from these worlds.
25.2.39	In which the middle is raised in one way, one should offer sacrifice there, desiring heaven.
25.2.40	From this indeed the gods went to the heavenly world, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
25.2.41	In which many plants are like one another, there one should offer sacrifice, desiring cattle.
25.2.42	Plants are cattle.
25.2.43	One attains the cattle of the earth.
25.2.44	Where the plants, with difficulty, in turn, have grown, there one should offer sacrifice for the sake of cattle.
25.2.45	From here the gods released the cattle.
25.2.46	One releases cattle.
25.2.47	One should offer sacrifice on a hairless tree to the one whom one hates.
25.2.48	What is hairless is contrary to the plants.
25.2.49-54	Plants and animals. He makes him deficient in animals. If one were to go to the divine sacrifice by a path that is not the prescribed one, one should sacrifice there to the one whom one desires, saying, "May he be cut off from offspring and animals." This is the divine sacrifice called "cut off." He is cut off from offspring, animals.
25.2.55	If there is a path between the water and the place of sacrifice, one should sacrifice on it for him whom one desires.
25.2.56	"So that no other sacrifice may approach him."
25.2.57	This is called the Parivartma, the place of sacrifice.
25.2.58	"The other sacrifice approaches him from all sides."
25.2.59	One should sacrifice at the place where the waters flow together from all sides for him who desires food.
25.2.60	The food is brought from the directions to him for whom it is brought. Water is food.
25.2.61	He obtains food from all directions.
25.2.62	This is the sacrifice of the gods called Samapa.
25.2.63	It is like the best of the equal.
25.3.1	If water were to flow from the Ahavaniya towards the east and from the Garhapatya towards the west, one should perform the sacrifice there. If one is examined in water, in a vessel, or in a marriage,
25.3.2	One is examined in water or in a vessel or in a marriage because of sin.
25.3.3	He turns away from sin.
25.3.4-8	Where the waters flow from the south to the east, there one who desires to prosper should offer. The waters are all the deities. This is the divine sacrifice, which is dear to the deities. If one offers in this way, in the divine sacrifice which is dear to deities, one becomes prosperous.
25.3.9	Where the waters are flowing towards the south, one should perform the sacrifice there, if one desires progeny.
25.3.10	The waters are all the deities.
25.3.11	The deities are the progeny.
25.3.12	He makes him a part of the progeny.
25.3.13	One who desires prosperity should perform the Kritrima sacrifice.
25.3.14	The Devayajana is the self.
25.3.15	He makes it himself.
25.3.16	Where one sees fire and water, one should recite the morning recitation and offer sacrifice there, if one desires:
25.3.17	"May the sacrifice not be deficient for me."
25.3.18	For Agni is all the deities,
25.3.19	and the waters are the sacrifice.
25.3.20	The other sacrifice bows down to him.
25.3.21	One offers sacrifice seeing both the deities and the sacrifice.
25.3.22-26	Where one sees fire, water, and the sun, one should recite the morning recitation. One should perform a sacrifice there for the sake of brahmic splendor. This is indeed the divine sacrifice called "three-splendored." One becomes endowed with brahmic splendor. If the divine sacrifice is performed before, one should perform it there against one's enemy. This world is left over for one's enemy.
25.3.27	He who is left out from the sacrifice of the gods, they make him obtain that much of a world.
25.3.28	He makes him without a world.
25.3.29	Indeed, he who knows and sacrifices at the sacrifice of the Gods prospers.
25.3.30	Indeed, Agni is the sacrifice of the Devas.
25.3.31	For in Agni all the deities are worshipped.
25.3.32	Wherever one may have installed Agni and sacrificed,
25.3.33	He prospers by that alone.
25.3.34	Brahmins indeed are the divine sacrifice.
25.3.35	One should perform a sacrifice where many Brahmins are pleased.
25.3.36	He prospers by that.
25.4.1	One measures the altar.
25.4.2	One measures it with thirty steps from the back, with thirty-six steps towards the east, and with twenty-four steps towards the front.
25.4.3	Viraj herself measures it from the west, with Brihatī from the east, with Gāyatrī from the front.
25.4.4	He measures it all around with the metres.
25.4.5	He stands firm in Viraj, in that he completes Viraj.
25.4.6	He carries the Stambayajus with a bamboo.
25.4.7	Indra struck Vṛtra with the thunderbolt.
25.4.8	It became three-fold: the Sphy (a wooden mallet), the sacrificial post, and the chariot.
25.4.9	The Sphy is indeed the thunderbolt.
25.4.10	The earth is as much as the altar.
25.4.11	One destroys the enemy with the thunderbolt.
25.4.12	One takes it three times.
25.4.13	These are the three worlds.
25.4.14	One destroys him from these worlds.
25.4.15	One takes the fourth silently.
25.4.16	He distributes it from the unlimited (heap).
25.4.17	Indra, having killed Vritra, placed him down with this (verse).
25.4.18	He who takes the fourth silently, he places his enemy down with this (same verse).
25.4.19	He cuts the root.
25.4.20	He cuts the very root of his enemy.
25.4.21	He uproots.
25.4.22	Therefore the plants become withered.
25.4.23	He strews the sacrificial grass.
25.4.24	Therefore, the seasons come again.
25.4.25	"He says, "May I be without the Apārāru, the non-divine sacrifice, from the divine sacrifice on earth."
25.4.26	The Apārāru is the enemy.
25.4.27	He indeed removes the enemy from the earth.
25.4.28	"He (the sacrificer) says, "May the drops not fall from the sky."
25.4.29	What is the juice of this (earth), that is the drop.
25.4.30	These creatures live on it.
25.4.31-39	He gives it to him for his ascent. "So that he may not fall from heaven." The Asura was indeed the enemy. He smeared the earth with poison. No one ate of it. He who ate it, became poisoned. When he digs up,
25.4.40	Whatever is impure and unfit for sacrifice in him, that he removes.
25.4.41	One should dig up the root of a tree that has been uprooted for the sake of its destruction.
25.4.42	One should bury it below and far away.
25.4.43	Because his power is below, for the destruction of power.
25.4.44	Therefore, rice and barley are cooked in well-ploughed fields.
25.4.45	They say that his power is in the northern part.
25.4.46	These creatures subsist on that.
25.4.47	Therefore, one should not dig too much.
25.4.48	One should dig up to the foundation for the establishment of the sacrificer.
25.4.49	One should make the sacrificial grass towards the south.
25.4.50	It is the form of the divine assembly.
25.4.51	For the destruction of demons.
25.4.52	With dung.
25.4.53	Dung is cattle.
25.4.54	One obtains cattle.
25.5.1	One encloses the altar with a wooden spade.
25.5.2	The wooden spade is indeed the thunderbolt.
25.5.3	The earth is as big as the altar.
25.5.4	With the thunderbolt he destroys the enemy of the earth and with the metres he takes it for himself.
25.5.5	"The Vasus take you, with the metre of the Gayatri, on the right side."
25.5.6	Brahma is indeed the Gayatri.
25.5.7	He takes it on the right side with the Gayatri.
25.5.8	May the Rudras protect thee with the Tristubh metre. Thus on the west.
25.5.9	The Tristubh metre is strength and vigour.
25.5.10	He thus protects it on the west with strength.
25.5.11	May the Adityas protect thee with the Jagati metre. Thus on north.
25.5.12	The Jagati metre is cattle.
25.5.13	Cattle are on the north.
25.5.14	He makes it a place for the animals, for the sake of the stability of the animals.
25.5.15	And he encloses the animals on both sides with brilliance.
25.5.16	"Before the fierce one, the destroyer, the destroyer of enemies."
25.5.17	Whatever brilliance of this (earth) is fit for sacrifice, that he has taken away from the moon.
25.5.18	He indeed obtains that.
25.5.19	He sprinkles the kindling wood and the sacrificial grass.
25.5.20	These are dry and impure, but the water brought from the forest is pure and fit for sacrifice.
25.5.21	When he sprinkles with water, he makes them pure and fit for the sacrifice.
25.5.22	He sprinkles the altar.
25.5.23	He makes it pure and fit for a sacrifice.
25.5.24	And also what the diggers do to it that is cruel, that he appeases.
25.5.25	He strews the sacrificial grass.
25.5.26-33	The sacrificial grass is the offspring. The altar is the earth. He establishes the offspring on the earth. One spreads the entire altar. Therefore, all the plants follow the entire earth. One should spread it abundantly. The sacrificer becomes without injury, the Adhvaryu without fire.
25.5.34	The sacrificer is the Prastara.
25.5.35	The offspring is the sacrificial grass.
25.5.36	He places the sacrificer on the offspring.
25.5.37	He places it on the northern side.
25.5.38	For the sacrificer is on the northern side of the non-sacrificer.
25.5.39	He places (the Prastara) turned away.
25.5.40	For the sacrifice is turned away from the non-sacrificing.
25.5.41	Having sprinkled the Prastara, he throws it.
25.5.42	The sacrificer is the Pras tara.
25.5.43-49	He sends him to the heaven of the gods. One should not strike too high. If one were to strike too high, the hair would be cut off and the garments would be torn. He lights the tip with the tip. He makes the tip prosper with the tip. He strikes straight for one who desires heaven. He sends him to the straight heaven.
25.5.50	He should strike the one whom he hates.
25.5.51	He strikes him from the very heaven.
25.5.52	One should strike the one who desires rain.
25.5.53	The oblation that rises from here causes rain to fall from the sea.
25.5.54	One causes rain to fall by one's own oblation.
25.5.55	One should hit upwards if one desires, 'May a son be born to him as a male.'
25.5.56	The man is indeed above.
25.5.57	If one desires that a woman be born, one should strike the Prāstara after spreading it.
25.5.58	Indeed, a woman is as if spread.
25.5.59	The sacrificer is the Prāstāra.
25.5.60	Indeed, when one strikes the Prāstārā, one goes from this world.
25.5.61	When one takes up grass, one establishes him in this world.
25.5.62	One strikes in succession.
25.5.63	Whatever they do to him when they are cutting him up, that he appeases.
25.5.64	"He goes to the fire."
25.5.65	"He goes."
25.5.66	He says this, "He has gone to heaven."
25.5.67	"He hears, he listens."
25.5.68	He makes him hear the one who has gone to heaven.
25.6.1	The gods and the Asuras were in a contest.
25.6.2	Whatever of her splendor was fit for sacrifice, that became like the form of a lion, like the form of an animal, and stood in between.
25.6.3	They knew, "Which of us will she approach? They will be this."
25.6.4	The gods invited her.
25.6.5	She said, "Choose me as the first oblation to Agni. Then you will all obtain all your desires."
25.6.6	She returned to the gods.
25.6.7	Then the gods became victorious.
25.6.8	The Asuras became defeated.
25.6.9	For him who knows thus, the northern altar is laid down, and he who knows thus, sows it, becomes himself, his foe is overcome.
25.6.10	Ten steps are taken towards the west, obliquely.
25.6.11	Ten steps towards the east on both sides.
25.6.12	Unlimited steps towards the front.
25.6.13	The Viraja is measured.
25.6.14	Whatever wealth the Asuras had, the gods found it in the altar.
25.6.15	That is the Veda.
25.6.16	That which is to be known is the Uttaravedi.
25.6.17	That is the Uttaravedī.
25.6.18	For him who knows thus, the Veda is made, the Uttaravedi is placed, and he wins the wealth and the Veda of his enemy.
25.6.19	Prajapati's nose was torn off.
25.6.20	It became the Uttaravedi
25.6.21	Yajna is Prajapati.
25.6.22	When he lays down the Uttaravedi, he restores the nose of Prajapati from the mouth.
25.6.23	There are four names of this (Uttaravedi): Nasika, Kashari, Singhi, and Uttaravedi.
25.6.24	"Thou art Taptāyani."
25.6.25	For she has heated them.
25.6.26	"Thou are Vittāyani."
25.6.27	Because she has heated them up.
25.6.28	"Protect me from distress."
25.6.29	He protects them who are protected.
25.6.30	He protects those who are distressed.
25.6.31	He protects them who are distressed. "
25.6.32	"O Agni, you are the one who is in this earth, who is in the second one, who is in this third one."
25.6.33	Whatever is connected and hidden in these worlds, he obtains that.
25.6.34	"Agni knows the name of the sky."
25.6.35	Or, the wealth of Agni is the sky.
25.6.36	With that he entered this earth, reaching down to the knees.
25.6.37	Therefore, one should dig down to the knees for the sake of obtaining that same wealth of Agni.
25.6.38	"You are a lioness, you are a she-buffalo."
25.6.39	For it stood between in the form of a lioness and in the form of she-buffalo.
25.6.40-44	"May it be offered to the gods." He offers it to the gods. "May it be prepared for the gods." He prepares it for the gods. "May it be purified for the gods." It is purified for the gods. "May it be filled for the gods." It is filled for the gods. The last verse is "May the great one drink the sweet Soma." He prepares the end.
25.6.45	The vessel of the gods or the Uttaravedi.
25.6.46	He propitiates the deities with the vessel of the gods.
25.6.47	He offers the vessel of the deities to the deities themselves.
25.6.48	The ascetics were eaten by the jackals.
25.6.49	They, being eaten and rubbed, came out on the Uttaravedi
25.6.50	They did not eat them.
25.6.51	One of them smiled.
25.6.52-59	Then he sprinkled them. They took one of them as a gift. Therefore, it is not proper to be without a weapon. What he throws out. Whatever is his own excrement and urine, he throws out. He sprinkles. This much was the earth, as much as the northern altar. The demons shook it all around.
25.6.60	The gods, having removed them, placed them all around with these deities.
25.6.61	When he sprinkles,
25.6.62	these are the deities of these directions.
25.6.63	Having removed the demons, he places himself all around with these very deities for protection.
25.6.64	This is the first oblation of Agni that he obtains when he sprinkles.
25.6.65	Then he said to me, "You first ate the Agnihotra offering, and then you ate all your desires with me."
25.6.66	Then indeed, at that time, the Asuras were their enemies.
25.6.67	They desired, "May we overcome our enemies with them."
25.6.68	"You are the lion, the conqueror of enemies, svāhā." With this they overcame their enemies.
25.6.69	They desired, "May we obtain cattle."
25.6.70	"You are a lion, the abode of prosperity, svāhā," with this they obtained cattle.
25.6.71	They desired, "May be obtain offspring."
25.6.72	"You art a lion, the giver of good offspring, svāhā." With this they obtained offspring.
25.6.73	They desired to become the Ādityas.
25.6.74	"May the lion bring thee to the world of the sun, svāhā!" thereby they became the Ādityas.
25.6.75	Therefore these Ādityas are the progeny.
25.6.76	They desired: "May we be fit for sacrifice."
25.6.77	"May the lion bring the gods to the sacrificer who is fit for sacrifice, svāhā!" thereby they became fit for sacrifice.
25.6.78	They desired, "May we go to the heavenly world."
25.6.79	"To the beings, to thee!"
25.6.80	The gods are the beings.
25.6.81	By means of that he goes to heaven, to the world of heaven.
25.6.82	He who knows this and whose Uttaravedi is spread, and he who, knowing this, spreads it, he obtains all these desires.
25.6.83	These worlds were unsupported.
25.6.84	They trembled.
25.6.85	The gods supported them with these mantras.
25.6.86	When he lays down these enclosing sticks, it is for the sake of holding these worlds.
25.6.87	Agni indeed departed from the gods.
25.6.88	He settled in the first place among the animals, between the horns of a bull.
25.6.89	Therefore it is made of wool.
25.6.90	He settled among the trees in the second place, in the Pitudāra.
25.6.91	Therefore, he becomes a tree with fragrant wood.
25.6.92	The third one is among the plants, the fragrant and shining one.
25.6.93	Therefore, he becomes the fragrant and shining plant.
25.6.94	When these materials are collected,
25.6.95	Whatever is connected or hidden here, he collects them with these.
25.6.96	When he returned, he destroyed the body.
25.6.97	Whatever flesh he had became frankincense, whatever bone he had became sandalwood, whatever marrow he had became incense.
25.6.98	Whatever materials there are,
25.6.99	Whatever is connected with him here, whatever is his own, that he collects with these for the completeness of Agni.
25.6.100	"This is the nest of Agni, this is the excrement of Agni."
25.6.101	This is like a nest, like dung.
25.6.102	The sacrifice has been established. For the establishment of the sacrifice.
25.7.1	There were four priests of the gods: Bhupati, Bhuvanapati, Pati of beings, and Bhūta.
25.7.2	Of them, three were established by the Hotr.
25.7.3	Then what remained of Bhūta was afraid of being destroyed.
25.7.4	He hid himself.
25.7.5	He entered the ocean.
25.7.6	What he made into ashes in the ocean, that became this mud.
25.7.7	The fish spoke to him, and he cursed him, saying, "You shall be the one who approaches and kills me."
25.7.8	Therefore, one who approaches a fish kills it.
25.7.9	For he was cursed.
25.7.10	Then, having fled, he entered the river.
25.7.11	Therefore, the river is burnt, as if fierce and cruel.
25.7.12	The white horse, grazing, found him.
25.7.13	He found him at dawn.
25.7.14	Therefore he is called Pratyushta-mukha (one who has found at dawn).
25.7.15	He cried out.
25.7.16	That which was his voice became the auspicious bird, the Shukan.
25.7.17	Therefore, when he cries out to one who is lost, one finds him.
25.7.18	The gods, having found him, said, "You will be our Hotri."
25.7.19	He was afraid of death.
25.7.20	His brothers, who had died, said, "We will be your armor. We want a share in the gods."
25.7.21	They said, "Whatever oblation is outside the boundary, that shall be their share."
25.7.22	These indeed are the boundaries.
25.7.23	If the oblation were to spill outside the enclosing sticks, one should recite the following mantras: "To the lord of the earth, svāhā! To the lord of the world, svāhā!" "To the lord who is the protector of beings, svāhā."
25.7.24	These indeed are the gods who have spilled portions.
25.7.25	He sends him to those gods who have spilled their portions.
25.7.26	The sacrifice is in the middle of them, the sacrificer is on the right side, and the enemy is on the left side.
25.7.27	He should make the largest one in the middle, the most southerly one in the south, and the most northerly one in the north.
25.7.28	He places the largest one first.
25.7.29	For the sacrifice is the first.
25.7.30	He places in the south the most southerly one.
25.7.31	Just as the sacrificer approaches the sacrifice from the south, so does this.
25.7.32	He places at the back the most northerly one.
25.7.33	For the enemy is at the back.
25.7.34	By means of the sacrifice he makes the sacrificer advance.
25.7.35	By means of the sacrifice, he drives away his foe.
25.7.36	Having offered, he strikes at the southern end.
25.7.37	He pleases the sacrificer at the very mouth.
25.7.38	And he sends him to heaven as a sacrificial offering.
25.7.39	He sows the northern end.
25.7.40	He sows his foe there.
25.7.41	Then indeed, the learned Kahoda said: "What is the purpose of sacrifice, if one does not become superior to those who have fallen from the sacrifice?"
25.7.42	Where it falls, one should sprinkle water there.
25.7.43	One should measure with a span towards the east, saying "Svāhā to the lord of the earth." Towards the south, saying "Svāhà to the lord of Bhuvana." Towards the west, saying "Svähà to the lord pf the beings."
25.7.44	When the sacrifice falls, it is as if the people have fallen.
25.7.45	This indeed is the people.
25.7.46	He who comes to this does not return.
25.7.47	He obtains the blessing of this sacrifice which he desires.
25.7.48	He measures the directions.
25.7.49	The blessing of the sacrifice which has been spilled goes to the directions.
25.7.50	He obtains from the directions the blessing of the sacrifice.
25.7.51	He measures with the span.
25.7.52	This much is the man's strength, as long as his breath is present.
25.7.53	With as much strength as is in him, he collects it.
25.7.54	He pours water.
25.7.55	What is lost from the sacrifice, that dies.
25.7.56	They sprinkle it with water.
25.7.57	All the deities are water.
25.7.58	He thus makes it enter the deities.
25.7.59	If it is lost at the morning pressing,
25.7.60	The sacrifice went to the gods and to men.
25.7.61	If the sacrifice went to the plants and to men, one should recite this formula: "May the sacrifice come to me, to my wealth, to my prosperity."
25.7.62	If the sacrifice goes to the plants and men at midday, one should recite the formula: "May it come to me, my wealth, my prosperity."
25.7.63	If the sacrifice went to the ancestors at the third pressing, one should recite, "May the wealth of that sacrifice, which has been performed and concluded, come to me."
25.7.64	If the sacrifice went to heaven and earth at night, one should recite: "May the wealth..."
25.7.65	If the sacrifice has gone to the Gandharvas in the evening, he should recite this verse: "If the sacrifice has gone, may it come back to me, to the one who has performed it, to the one whose wealth has been exhausted."
25.7.66	These are the deities that go to the sacrifice when it is lost.
25.7.67	These same deities, having approached according to their respective deities, obtain the blessing of the sacrifice as desired.
25.7.68	He who knows this and who recites the Yajus for the sacrifice that has been spilled, and he who, knowing this, recites the Yajur, becomes more prosperous.
25.8.1	He recites the Yaja on the Havirdhana.
25.8.2	He makes them fit for sacrifice and worthy of being offered.
25.8.3	They undo the knots.
25.8.4	They undo human knots, intending to tie divine knots.
25.8.5	The Havir is in the Havirdhana.
25.8.6	They place the oblation on the spread out sacrificial grass.
25.8.7	Therefore they place the oblation in the Havirdhāna (shed) on the spread out grass.
25.8.8	The wife anoints (the oblation).
25.8.9	This is the wife's participation in the sacrifice.
25.8.10	And he places the pair at the mouth of the sacrifice for procreation.
25.8.11	He anoints three times towards the east.
25.8.12	For the animals of the world, indeed, anoint themselves with the Yajus for the purpose of turning away.
25.8.13	He anoints with the Yajush.
25.8.14	For the men of the world anoint themselves with Yajush for the purpose of averting.
25.8.15	He anoint on the right side.
25.8.16	For these (animals) turn towards the north and the human world.
25.8.17	He makes the northern one human.
25.8.18	If he were to offer them in the northern direction, they would not return to either world.
25.8.19	They proceed towards heaven or the world of the Havirdhana.
25.8.20	He offers with the Savitri verse, "One yokes the mind."
25.8.21	He sends them to heaven through Savitri.
25.8.22	The Havirdhana is indeed the oblation.
25.8.23	Oblation that is not offered does not attain the goal.
25.8.24	Whatever he anoints, he anoints it for the sake of being fit.
25.8.25	This is a dry one, seized by Nirriti, the axle, bound on both sides by the two yokes, and bitten by the two yoking-straps.
25.8.26	Whatever he anoints, it makes him fit and suitable for the sacrifice.
25.8.27	There was an Asura named Ghoṣa.
25.8.28	He entered the trees.
25.8.29	The gods, having seized him, bound him on both sides.
25.8.30	If the dog howls, if the Asura-like speech censures the sacrifice, the Rakshas would follow the sacrifice and kill it.
25.8.31	They go along, not being followed by the Rakshas.
25.8.32	The Rakshas follow the sacrifice along the path and seek to harm it.
25.8.33	One offers on the path of Vishnu.
25.8.34	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
25.8.35	He removes the demons from the sacrifice by means of Vishnu.
25.8.36	The oblation offered in a place where there is no fire is defective.
25.8.37	When one offers oblations after placing gold, one offers in the presence of Agni for prosperity.
25.8.38	Those who go to the heaven are the oblations in the Havirdhana.
25.8.39	One offers in the path of the Dakshina with the Gayatri verse.
25.8.40	He makes them step on this (earth).
25.8.41	The northern one is in Tristubh.
25.8.42	He makes them step on the atmosphere.
25.8.43	He makes (them) go to the Ahavaniya.
25.8.44	He makes the gods go to the heavenly world.
25.8.45	For the heavenly world is the Ahavaniya fire.
25.8.46	He makes three steps forward.
25.8.47	These are the three worlds.
25.8.48	He makes these worlds for him.
25.8.49	"O Vishnu, from heaven or from earth," he recites on the southern sacrificial post.
25.8.50	Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
25.8.51	He obtains the blessing of the sacrifice at the very mouth.
25.8.52	He goes towards the northern post, hoping for it.
25.8.53	"Which of Vishnu's powers shall I proclaim?" he recites on it.
25.8.54	The northern sacrificial post is indeed Vishnu's.
25.8.55	He himself makes it prosperous with his own deity.
25.8.56	He places the covering above, saying, "Thou art the back of Vishnu."
25.8.57	He makes it here, what is this upper half of the head.
25.8.58	He says in front, "Thou art Vishnu's breast."
25.8.59	He makes the breast here.
25.8.60	He says on all sides, "Thou art in Vishnu's garment."
25.8.61	He makes a garment here.
25.8.62	They sew the bamboo-stick in front of the animal.
25.8.63	Therefore the eyebrows of a man are oblique.
25.8.64	"He says, "Thou art the thread of Vishnu, thou art the firm of Vishnu."
25.8.65	The Havirdhana is indeed of Vishnu.
25.8.66	He sews with his own deity.
25.8.67	He ties the knot with his own deity.
25.8.68	The first knot that he would tie, that he should first untie for his own protection.
25.8.69	If the Adhvaryu were to be afflicted by any other disease before (the Soma-pressing),
25.8.70	They bind (the Soma-plants) above the Sāmīya (grass), and then they loosen them.
25.8.71	Men yoke below and loosen in front, for turning away.
25.8.72-77	The Havirdhāna is indeed the head of the sacrifice. It is the most senior in front and the most junior at the back. Therefore, the head of a man is the most senior at the front and the most inferior at the back. He recites the formula, "You are Vaishnavam (belonging to Vishnu), for Vishnu." The Havirdhāna belongs to Vishnu. He makes it complete by his own deity.
25.8.78	Then he praises him with the verse, "May Vishnu praise with his strength." He makes the sacrificer take three steps towards the east.
25.8.79	He sends him to the world of Vishnu.
25.9.1	The Havirdhana is indeed the head of the sacrifice, and the Uparavas are the vital breaths.
25.9.2	He draws a line below the southern Havirdhana.
25.9.3	This is indeed the earlier one of the two.
25.9.4	He gives back the vital airs of the sacrifice from the mouth itself.
25.9.5	Therefore the vital airs are from the mouth.
25.9.6	He draws four lines.
25.9.7	For there are four vital airs.
25.9.8	He draws them in the opposite direction, each one by one.
25.9.9	They dig them up to this extent, to this extent they dig up the vital airs without injuring them, for the non-injury of the vital airs.
25.9.10	If he were to injure them, he would injure the vital airs and would perish.
25.9.11	They are cut in one place by the other.
25.9.12	Therefore the vital breaths are cut in one part by the other. "
25.9.13	"He takes up the wedge, saying, 'In the impulse of the divine Savitr.'
25.9.14	He takes it with the deity impelled by Savitr.
25.9.15	"He says, 'I cut off the neck of the Rakshas here.'
25.9.16	The Rakshas is the enemy.
25.9.17-22	He cuts off the neck of his enemy. "He says, "I cut off the neck of him who is equal to us or unequal to us and who harms us." The Uparavas are the vital breaths. He cuts off the enemy from the vital breaths. He cuts off the enemy. He cuts it off with the formula, "Thou art great, thou art the great stone, speak the great speech to Indra."
25.9.23	For he speaks to Indra the speech of the Brihatī.
25.9.24	"The Rakṣa-destroying, the Vala-destroying, and the Viṣṇu-destroying (verses) are for the destruction of the Rakṣas."
25.9.25	"The Viṣṇu (verses) are (verses) of Viṣṇu."
25.9.26	Viṣṇu is the sacrifice.
25.9.27	He himself, with his own deity, prospers.
25.9.28	The gods and the Asuras fought.
25.9.29	The Asuras dug up the Vala-s in the vital airs of the gods.
25.9.30	They found them within the length of an arm.
25.9.31	Therefore, one should know the length of an arrow to be within the length of one's arm for the sake of following the breath.
25.9.32	"Here I remove those thorns that have been planted by our enemies, whether they are equal or unequal."
25.9.33	He removes them after knowing what has been cursed and what has been attacked here.
25.9.34	Therefore, these are the remedies.
25.9.35	Therefore they address the sick one.
25.9.36	"He is the emperor, he is the self-emperor." Thus he attains sovereignty through these.
25.9.37	"With the Gayatri metre, with the Trishtup metre, with the Jagati metre, I strike him whom I hate."
25.9.38	These are all the metres.
25.9.39	He strikes his enemy with the metres.
25.9.40	What is good here, that may we have together." He prays for a blessing.
25.9.41	"The Valga is removed, the Avabaddha, the Durasya." As in the Yajus.
25.9.42	"I sprinkle the Vishnu-ones, the slayer of Rakshas, the slayer of Valga." For the removal of Rakshas.
25.9.43	"What are the Vishnu-ones?"
25.9.44	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
25.9.45	He himself blesses them with his own deity.
25.9.46	"I sprinkle the Vaisnavas, the destroyers of Rakshas and Valagas, for the destruction of Rakshas."
25.9.47	And whatever harm they do while digging, that he appeases.
25.9.48	"What are the Vaisnavan?"
25.9.49	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
25.9.50	He himself, with his own deity, prospers them.
25.9.51	"The destroyer of Rakshas, the destroyer of Valagas, I spread the Vaishnava (grasses). For the destruction of Rakshas."
25.9.52	"What is Vaishnava?"
25.9.53	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
25.9.54	He himself, with his own deity, prospers them.
25.9.55	He sprinkles and spreads.
25.9.56	Therefore the vital airs are inside, with hair, and with water.
25.9.57	I sprinkle the destroyers of Rakshas, the destroyers of Valagas, with the formula, "Thou art the destroyer of Rakshas." For the destruction of Rakshas.
25.9.58	That it is said, "Thou art of Vishnu"
25.9.59	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
25.9.60	He himself, by his own deity, prospers.
25.9.61	These are the Rishis, the makers, the unclean.
25.9.62	The waters are the pure, the fit for sacrifice.
25.9.63	When he sprinkles with water, he makes them pure and fit for sacrifice.
25.9.64	The two ends of the bow are the two ends of the sacrifice.
25.9.65	They are not cut off.
25.9.66	Therefore the two ends of a bow are not cut off;
25.9.67	The one in front is shorter, the one behind is longer.
25.9.68	For that is the way with the two ends of bows.
25.9.69	The distance between the two ends of (the bow) is two fingers.
25.9.70	Therefore this space between the two ends (of the bow) is like the neck.
25.9.71	I place the two destroyers of Rakshas and Vala, the two destroyers of Vala, the destroyers of Rakshasa, the two destroyers, the two destroyers.
25.9.72	What is meant by 'the two destroyers of Raksha and Vala'?
25.9.73	Yajna is Vishnu.
25.9.74	He himself, by his own deity, prospers.
25.9.75	I encircle the two destroyers of Raksasa and Vala, encircle the two encirclers, the two encircler, the two encircling.
25.9.76	What is the meaning of 'the two encirclings of Rakshasa and Vala'? The two encirclations of Rakshasa.
25.9.77	Yajna indeed is Vishnu.
25.9.78	He himself makes it prosper with the same deity.
25.9.79	He makes it round.
25.9.80	Therefore, O Agni, thou art not burnt, with thy lips, with thy cheeks, with thy beard.
25.9.81	The Havirdhana is indeed the head of the sacrifice, the Uparava are the vital airs, the jaws are the Adhiṣavaṇa, the teeth are the stones, the tongue is the Adhiṣaṇṇa, the skin is the head, the Dronakalaśa is the head.
25.9.82	Sacrifice is Prajapati.
25.9.83	From the mouth of Prajapati they drink Soma.
25.9.84	Therefore it is like eaten, like pressed.
25.9.85	For thus it becomes pressed by the teeth.
25.9.86	He who knows Viraj, to be milked at the mouth of sacrifice, milks her.
25.9.87	This indeed is Viraj.
25.9.88	The pressing stone is her udder, the pressing stones are her teats, the calves are the pressing stones, the skin is the pressing stone, the hide is the pressing stone.
25.9.89	The priests milk her.
25.9.90	He who knows Viraj as to be milked at the mouth of the sacrifice, he milks her.
25.10.1	The Havirdhana is the head of this sacrifice, the Agnidhra is the neck, the Sadas is the belly, the Udumbara is the strength.
25.10.2	When he places the Udumbara post in the middle, he places energy in the middle, in the sacrificer and in the offspring.
25.10.3	Therefore, offspring are born in the middle and they attain energy.
25.10.4	The Udumbara post is erected for this world, the sacrificial post for the other world.
25.10.5	Therefore he sprinkles the sacrificial post from this side, and the Udumbara branch from the other side, for the support of these two worlds.
25.10.6	The Udumbara is indeed energy.
25.10.7	In that he sprinkles the Udumbara from the other side (of the post), he causes energy to flow from the other side.
25.10.8	He places energy in this world.
25.10.9	The Udgātṛ of Prajāpati,
25.10.10	he takes his stand on the Udumbara (tree).
25.10.11	He pours down the sap on the offspring.
25.10.12	"He takes up the wedge, saying, 'By the impulse of the divine Savitr.'
25.10.13	He takes it up with the impulse of Savitr, with the deities."
25.10.14	"He says, 'I cut off the neck of the Rakṣas.'
25.10.15	The Rakṣas is the enemy.
25.10.16	He cuts off the neck of his enemy.
25.10.17	"The worlds, the abode of the fathers, are purified." He purifies it.
25.10.18	And whatever harm they do to him while digging, he appeases that.
25.10.19	He sprinkles with barley-seeds.
25.10.20	Barley is food.
25.10.21	The Udumbara is strength.
25.10.22	He places food in strength.
25.10.23	"I spread thee on the world of the Fathers."
25.10.24	If they were to spread it without the sacrificial grass, it would be a pit.
25.10.25	The plants are in the northern half of this (world).
25.10.26	He spreads it in the northern half.
25.10.27	It is not a pit.
25.10.28	"Raise the sky, fill the atmosphere, strengthen on the earth," thus he strengthens it.
25.10.29	"May the wind, the Niṭāna, destroy thee."
25.10.30	The Niṭāna is the mind.
25.10.31	The Maruts are the vital airs.
25.10.32	He takes it with its own deity.
25.10.33	The Niṭānas and Maruts, indeed, are the deities of the Udumbara.
25.10.34	He takes her with them.
25.10.35	"With the firm law of Mitra and Varuna."
25.10.36	Or, with the friend, these creatures are peaceful, held by Varuna. By means of the established, for the purpose of holding.
25.10.37	"He says, "You are the abode of Brahman, you are the abode of the Kshatriya." He is indeed blessing.
25.10.38	"He makes him firm by saying, "Make Brahman firm, make the Kshatriya firm."
25.10.39	"He says (to the Adhvaryu), "Fill the heaven and earth with ghee."
25.10.40	He anoints the heaven and earth with ghee.
25.10.41	Therefore plants grow without being anointed.
25.10.42	He offers the Udumbara with ghee.
25.10.43	Ghee is indeed brilliance.
25.10.44	The Udumbara is food.
25.10.45	He places brilliance in food.
25.10.46	He puts the sap in the trees and plants.
25.10.47	He says, "May it be the shade of all people."
25.10.48-55	This is the shadow of the whole world. They spread from one family to another. One should make the leaves of the Udumbara tree face upwards. The plants are indeed the divine classes. The plants (are) the leaves. The Udumbara tree is the sacrificer. He makes the offspring face towards the sacrificer. The leaves become the sacrificer.
25.10.56	Now the one who is inside.
25.10.57	Therefore, the flesh of a man.
25.10.58	Now the axe.
25.10.59	The sacrificial hall is indeed the belly of the sacrifice.
25.10.60	They spread it sideways.
25.10.61	Therefore, food is placed in a man.
25.10.62	If they were to spread it along the body, food would not be placed in a man;
25.10.63	The sacrifice is measured by the man, the man by the sacrifice;
25.10.64	Because it is so, the man is so.
25.10.65	It is sewn together.
25.10.66	Therefore the man is sewn together within.
25.10.67	"He says, 'Thou art the thread of Indra, thou art the firm of Indra.'
25.10.68	The hall is indeed Indra's.
25.10.69	He sews it together with its own deity.
25.10.70	He ties a knot with his own deity.
25.10.71	He recites the formula, "Thou art Indra's, for Indra thee."
25.10.72	The assembly hall is Indra's.
25.10.73	He himself makes it prosperous by his own deity.
25.10.74	If it is an Agniṣṭoma, one should make nine cuts.
25.10.75	It is prosperous with the three-fold brilliance.
25.10.76	If it be a Ukthya, one should make fifteen cuts.
25.10.77	It becomes prosperous with the fifteen.
25.10.78	The thunderbolt is fifteen.
25.10.79	equal to the thunderbolt.
25.10.80	If there is an extra-long night, it is equal to seventeen.
25.10.81	It is equal to seventeen (nights).
25.10.82	Prajapati is seventeen.
25.10.83	It equals Prajapati.
25.10.84	For one desiring stability, one should perform twenty-one (nights).
25.10.85	Twenty-one is the stability of the Stotras, for stability, and also for the exclusion of the Yajnakrama.
25.10.86	If one desires rain, one should make the lower ones the highest.
25.10.87	For the sky is as if low when it is going to rain.
25.10.88	If one desires that it not rain, one should do the opposite.
25.10.89	For the heaven is as if high when it is not going to rain. The southern ones are the higher ones.
25.10.90	One should make the northern ones the higher ones.
25.10.91	The gifts given to the east are for the world of the sacrificer, those given to the west are for the world beyond.
25.10.92	He makes the sacrificer superior to the non-sacrificer.
25.10.93	The sacrificer is superior to the non sacrificer.
26.1.1	The sacrificial grass is spread out for the support of these two worlds.
26.1.2	They are spread out for one and not for another.
26.1.3	Those who are placed here support this world; those who are not placed support the other world.
26.1.4	The other world is indeed undefined.
26.1.5	Agni indeed departed from the gods.
26.1.6	He entered the earth.
26.1.7	They found him at the knee-height.
26.1.8	Therefore, one should offer at the knee- height.
26.1.9	Having found him, he offers them.
26.1.10	He pours down the Catvāla-bricks.
26.1.11	This is the womb of Agni.
26.1.12	He pours them down from the womb itself.
26.1.13	He who knows the place of the Vedi does not meet with any calamity.
26.1.14	One should move from the Agnidhra-shed towards the east and from the Catvāla towards the west.
26.1.15	This is indeed the place of the vedi.
26.1.16	He who knows thus does not suffer any misfortune.
26.1.17	The Adhvaryu should not go beyond the Sadas.
26.1.18	The Sadas is indeed the belly of the sacrifice.
26.1.19	If one were to draw the belly of the sacrificer, it would perish.
26.1.20	This is indeed the people of the Adhvaryu, he goes to the people.
26.1.21	Going to the people, one conquers the people.
26.1.22	If one goes beyond, one should move towards Indra.
26.1.23	The Sada is indeed Indra's.
26.1.24	He moves with his own deity.
26.1.25	One should not go beyond the Havirdhāna (shed).
26.1.26	The Havirdhāna is indeed the head of the sacrifice.
26.1.27	If one were to move the head of the sacrificer, it would perish.
26.1.28	If one goes beyond, one should move with the Vaisnava (mantra).
26.1.29	The Havirdhāna is indeed Vaisnava.
26.1.30	One moves with his own divinity.
26.1.31	They say, one should move only with the Kṣaitra-patya (mantra).
26.1.32	This is the lord of the field.
26.1.33	Therefore it does not go to him.
26.1.34	In that world there was Soma.
26.1.35	The Dhishnyas protected it.
26.1.36	It was brought by Gayatri.
26.1.37	The Hotra and Potra did not protect the Soma.
26.1.38	Therefore, when these two are not Hotras, they do not protect the Soma properly.
26.1.39	Therefore one should not be a Hotra or Potra.
26.1.40	Therefore, they are like those who sacrifice together.
26.1.41	They followed him, giving him other names.
26.1.42	Therefore, a Brahmin has two names and half of the sacrificial fee.
26.1.43	They sat around him, desiring their share.
26.1.44	He allotted this share to them.
26.1.45	When he pours the oblations for the Adhvaryus, he satisfies them with their own share.
26.1.46	Those who sat down on the nearest (seat) obtained the Soma-drink. The Ahavaniya, Agnidhra and Hotri are (the seats) of the gods.
26.1.47	Therefore they do not injure one who utters the Vasat-call above them.
26.1.48	For they are pleased.
26.1.49	The Adhvaryu should not step over the Dhishnyas from behind.
26.1.50	The Dhishnyas are the vital airs.
26.1.51	He would draw the vital airs together.
26.1.52	The Hotar from behind.
26.1.53	The Hotr is indeed the navel of the sacrifice.
26.1.54	The breath is above the navel, the out-breath below.
26.1.55	If one were to place the out-breath in the breath, one would perish.
26.1.56	The Rakshas attacked the sacrifice of the gods from the right.
26.1.57	They defeated it again from the Agnidhra.
26.1.58-62	For the Agni-dhr (priest) is the most important of all the priests, and the Agni-dhrs are the most important of the priests. There was a demon named Jambha. He interrupted the sacrifice of the gods. He did not interrupt the Agni-dhar. When they move from the Agni-dahr to the other priests, it is for the sake of the victory of the sacrifice and the destruction of the demons. The Agni-dhr is the most important.
26.1.63	The embers are used in the first two Savanas.
26.1.64	For they are bright.
26.1.65	The glowing sticks are used in the third Savana.
26.1.66	For they also are bright.
26.1.67	All his Savanas become bright, for him who knows this.
26.1.68	The gods drove away the Asuras with oblations offered towards the east, and others with oblations offered to the west.
26.1.69	The Dhishnya-bricks are laid down in the east.
26.1.70	Other oblations are offered in the east for the destruction of the enemy.
26.1.71	The Dhishnyas are the dear forms of Agni Vaisvânara.
26.1.72	When he lays down the Dhishnyas, he raises them up.
26.1.73	This Agni Vaisvâna is let loose when the Agnishtoma is performed.
26.1.74	That lord, being unpacified, would injure the sacrificer and the members of the sacrifice.
26.1.75	One should sprinkle.
26.1.76	The sacrificer for the non-injury of himself.
26.1.77	At the third pressing, the blessings of the sacrifice are uttered.
26.1.78	If one were to sprinkle, one would conceal oneself from them.
26.1.79	The fathers know the navel.
26.1.80	One should make the navel visible.
26.1.81	One should rub the ears.
26.1.82	One does not conceal oneself from the blessings.
26.1.83	The fathers know him.
26.1.84	They indeed kill Soma when they press it.
26.1.85	All those who have joined should sing the Agniṣṭoma.
26.1.86	The Agniṣṭoma is the end.
26.1.87	They blow it at the very end.
26.1.88	"A Brahman drinks Soma for the sake of his senses."
26.1.89	If he were to sing, his senses would be lost.
26.1.90	Therefore, one should not sing.
26.1.91	The Agniṣṭoma is a year.
26.1.92	There are twelve Agniṣṭoma stotras.
26.1.93	Twelve months are a year.
26.1.94	Beings are born in accordance with the year.
26.1.95	When he makes the water flow at the Agniṣṭoma Stotra, it is for the sake of procreation.
26.1.96	When the wife performs at the sacrifice, it becomes a couple.
26.1.97	When the woman makes the water flow, she pours the semen into the couple.
26.1.98	The Udgātṛ recites the Pātnīvata.
26.1.99	The Udagātṛ is the male.
26.1.100	The offspring are born from the wife.
26.1.101	He pours it on the Vrisana (bull) for the purpose of propagation.
26.1.102	He makes it flow from the thighs.
26.1.103	For it is from the thighs that offspring are born. For the purpose of propagation,
26.1.104	The deity is indeed like a hidden one.
26.1.105	For it indeed performs the act of begetting from within.
26.1.106	One should carry it far above.
26.1.107	The chief of the unashamed ones is born.
26.1.108	One should not make it flow towards the south.
26.1.109	Whatever Dakshina he would give to the Pitrs, he would generate progeny.
26.1.110	He directs them towards the north and the east.
26.1.111	This is indeed the direction of men.
26.1.112	He generates them in the world of men.
26.2.1	The gods conquered these worlds with the Upasads.
26.2.2	They released them with the Vaisharadani rites, just as a village is released from a battle.
26.2.3-7	That is the reason why they are called Vaisarjanas. They lead the Soma towards the east. They lead their wives towards the east. They lead them towards these worlds. With Agni as their mouth, the gods conquered these worlds: with the Garhapatya this one, with the Agnidhriya the intermediate one, and with the Ahavaniya that yonder one.
26.2.8	The Garhapatya fire is conquered by this (world).
26.2.9	The Agnidhra fire is conquered by the atmosphere.
26.2.10	The Ahavaniya fire is conquered (by the world) beyond.
26.2.11	This (fire) is carried for the heavenly world.
26.2.12	He offers on the Garhapatya with two (verses).
26.2.13	The sacrificer has two feet.
26.2.14	He makes him step on this (earth).
26.2.15-20	When he offers on the Agni-fire in the Agni-dhra, he makes him enter the atmosphere. When he offers on the Visnu-fire in the Ahavaniya, he makes him go to the heavenly world. For the Ahavaniya is the heavenly world. Now at this time the Rakshas attack him, who has fallen from here, and has not yet reached there. "He offers on the Garhapatya with the formula, "Thou art Soma."
26.2.21	These are the offspring of Soma.
26.2.22	He says this to the offspring themselves.
26.2.23	"Accepting the water."
26.2.24	Having made him accept the water, he leads him across.
26.2.25	When he offers on the Agni-sthala with an offering to Agni, having made him Agni, he leads him through the atmosphere.
26.2.26	When he makes an offering to Vishnu on the Ahavaniya, he sends him to heaven.
26.2.27	Heaven is the world of the Āhavanīya.
26.2.28	He is indeed taken from all, from men, from the Fathers, from the gods.
26.2.29	"He offers to the Garhapatya with the words, "Thou art Soma."
26.2.30	These creatures are Soma-like."
26.2.31	He indeed speaks to him for the sake of the creatures.
26.2.32	"He says, "Accepting, drinking," indeed he speaks to him for Fathers."
26.2.33	When he offers to the Āgnīdhra with the Āgneya verse,
26.2.34	Agni is all the deities.
26.2.35	He indeed addresses him to the deities themselves.
26.2.36	Soma is indeed Vaishnavya.
26.2.37	He indeed weakens him by means of the deity, if he makes other and other deities.
26.2.38	If one offers on the Vaishnavya fire, then one indeed strengthens him by means of his own deity.
26.2.39	Varuna seizes all of them when he consecrates men, ancestors and gods.
26.2.40	"He offers to the Garhapatya with the words, "Thou art Soma." He offers to the Garhapata with the words, "Thou art Soma."
26.2.41	These are the progeny of Soma.
26.2.42	He releases the progeny from the noose of Varuna.
26.2.43	"He releases the ancestors from the noose with the words, "Accepting the water."
26.2.44-49	When he offers to Agni in the Agni-dhra, (it is) because Agni is all the deities. He is released from the noose of Varuna, the deities. Being free from debt, he goes forth conquering these worlds. That is the reason for the release of the releases. Therefore they say, "Now he releases even the animals in the forest."
26.2.50	He places the Agni-drava-gravas in the Agni-dravas.
26.2.51	He carries the Soma towards the east.
26.2.52	They kill him with these (stones).
26.2.53	He turns him away from the killers.
26.2.54	He who knows this does not fall into the hands of the killers.
26.2.55	One should not fall into the east.
26.2.56	Rudra is Agni.
26.2.57	Animals are the parts.
26.2.58	One would offer animals to Rudra.
26.2.59-66	He would be without cattle. They go towards the east from the west. Soma is indeed prosperity. One obtains prosperity towards the east as it were. Therefore, the eastern regions and the eastern people conquer the western regions and the western people. One who has lost prosperity should go towards the east. One obtains the prosperity towards the west as it were. One stands in this very world.
26.2.67	Then they offer Soma.
26.2.68	The sacrificer approaches from the front.
26.2.69	He thus embraces prosperity on both sides.
26.2.70	"He says, "Do thou offer to the sky."
26.2.71	For now this (Soma) belongs to the sky-god.
26.2.72	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, "Do you sit on the skin of Aditi, in the abode of Aditi."
26.2.73	Soma indeed is Aditya.
26.2.74	Aditi is the earth.
26.2.75	The Soma is collected from the earth.
26.2.76	He places it in its own womb.
26.2.77	"This Soma is yours, O god Savitr."
26.2.78	Savitr is the lord of the gods.
26.2.79	Men protect it from here onwards.
26.2.80	Therefore he gives it back for protection.
26.2.81	"This you, O divine Soma, have approached the gods."
26.2.82	For this is indeed a god approaching the gods.
26.2.83	"This I offer to men together with offspring and prosperity."
26.2.84	He returns to this world together with offspring and cattle.
26.2.85	"Salutations to the gods, Svāhā to the fathers."
26.2.86	Salutations to the devas, Svāhā (means) to the fathers.
26.2.87	"May I be released from the noose of the destroyer, from the noose (of Varuna)."
26.2.88	He is released from the nouse of the destroyer, the noose of Varuna.
26.2.89	The Svaras are the heavens.
26.2.90	These worlds are the Svaras.
26.2.91	He sees these worlds.
26.2.92	O Agni, the guardian of vows.
26.2.93	He makes his body turn around with Agni. To Tanunaptra.
26.2.94	He protects him from the powerful.
26.2.95	He makes the body as it should be with Agni.
26.2.96	Now indeed, he (the sacrificer) releases his body with the gods.
26.2.97	That is the reason why they are called 'releases'.
26.2.98	One should say the first one of oneself.
26.2.99	If one says the first one of the other, the lord would be the loser.
26.2.100	One should say of the one whom one hates.
26.2.101	Agni is Rudra.
26.2.102	He indeed dedicates him to Rudra.
26.2.103	Then he shoots.
26.3.1	One should not offer oblations while being consecrated.
26.3.2	The consecrated one is the oblation.
26.3.3	Agni is Rudra.
26.3.4	If one were to offer oblations, one would consign one's own self, which is the oblation, to Rudra.
26.3.5	And if one were not to offer oblations at all, one would obstruct the sacrifice.
26.3.6	If the Soma has been purchased, one should offer oblations in the fire of the consecrated one.
26.3.7	For then the sacrifice has been released.
26.3.8	The oblations become offered to the departed.
26.3.9	If the fire is not bought, one should take the kindling wood and ghee, go to another place, kindle the fire, and offer it at the end of the sacrificial post with the Vaisnavya verse.
26.3.10	The sacrificial post is Vaisnava.
26.3.11	One protects it with its own deity.
26.3.12	"One goes beyond others, not to others."
26.3.13	One indeed goes beyond others.
26.3.14	One does not go to others.
26.3.15	"Those whom he does not approve, he rejects."
26.3.16	He rejects those whom he does not like.
26.3.17	"I have found you from the lower ones, from the higher ones."
26.3.18	He finds him from the lower ones and from the higher ones.
26.3.19	"We approve of you, O tree, for the sake of offering to the gods."
26.3.20	For he is accepted by the sacrifice.
26.3.21	"He is accepted by Vishnu."
26.3.22	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
26.3.23	He makes him acceptable to the sacrifice.
26.3.24	May the god Savitar anoint thee with honey.
26.3.25	Honey is ghee.
26.3.26	He makes it fit for sacrifice, fit for the sacrifice.
26.3.27	O plant, protect him.
26.3.28	He makes a shield.
26.3.29	"Do not injure him!"
26.3.30	The thunderbolt is the Svādhiti, for non-injury.
26.3.31	One should take the first piece that falls down.
26.3.32	This is the one that falls down for him, his brilliance follows it.
26.3.33	He makes him brilliant.
26.3.34	If it falls to the right, one should not remove it.
26.3.35	It is a pit.
26.3.36	If it is turned towards the north, one should not.
26.3.37	The one with a thick top is the one to be cut.
26.3.38	If one cuts the one with branches pointing upwards and with a thick top,
26.3.39	This is the one to cut.
26.3.40	One should cut the one to be used for the sacrificial post.
26.3.41	If one were to cut the one with a dry top, many branches and leaves,
26.3.42	Plants are the lords of the forest.
26.3.43	Animals are plants.
26.3.44	He prospers with animals.
26.3.45	If one wishes to harm someone, one should cut down a tree that is dry at the top, without branches or leaves.
26.3.46	Oṣadhayaḥ vanaspatayaḥ (Oṣadhaya vanaspataya)
26.3.47	Oṣadhayo vaśavah (Oṣadhayor vaśavah)
26.3.48	One harms him with cattle.
26.3.49	If one cuts down a tree that leans towards the north or east,
26.3.50	It is indeed the one that leans towards the sacrifice.
26.3.51	One cuts down the one that leans toward the sacrifice.
26.3.52	Do not injure the sky. Be united with the earth."
26.3.53	The sacrificial post is indeed a thunderbolt, for the non-injury of these worlds.
26.3.54	He directs it upwards and towards the east.
26.3.55	This indeed is the world of the gods.
26.3.56	He directs him towards the world of the Gods.
26.3.57	"O tree, grow with a hundred shoots," he offers at the tying down.
26.3.58	He establishes stability in the trees.
26.3.59	Therefore, from this Avraścana, more are born.
26.3.60	"We grow together with a thousand shoots." He prays for a blessing.
26.3.61	"He who is this Svadhita, the one who knows, leads you to great good fortune."
26.3.62	He is led to great good fortune, for he who is led to the sacrifice is led to great fortune.
26.3.63	If one were to ascend the Avraścana and were to hate someone, it would be for him.
26.3.64	The ascent is indeed a place without a womb, without a base.
26.3.65	He makes it a place without a base, without a womb.
26.3.66	If one were to cut off the tail,
26.3.67	The tail is indeed a place with a womb, with a base.
26.3.68	One makes the sacrificer a place with a base, with a womb.
26.3.69	One were to cut off at the ankle,
26.3.70	The ankle is indeed a place of injury.
26.3.71	The sacrifice is a place of injury.
26.4.5	Eight are the supports, two are the rough ones.
26.4.6	The self is eleven.
26.4.7	One should cut (the wood) according to the size of the animal.
26.4.8	One should build according to the size prescribed in the Stoma.
26.4.9	It should not be more than twenty-four cubits.
26.4.10	It is measured by the three-fold brilliance.
26.4.11	One should construct it according to the fifteen cubits.
26.4.12	One should measure it by the fifteen.
26.4.13	The thunderbolt is fifteen.
26.4.14	It is equal to the thunderbolt.
26.4.15-24	It should be measured with seventeen cubits. It is equal to seventeen. Prajapati is seventeen. It is measured by Prajapati. It should be measured with twenty-one cubits. it is equal to twenty-one. The sun is twenty-one. It is measured by the sun. It should measure twenty-seven cubits. equal to twenty-seven.
26.4.25	These three worlds are nine times nine.
26.4.26	It is equal to these worlds.
26.4.27	It should be measured with thirty-three cubits.
26.4.28	It is measured with thirty-two.
26.4.29	There are thirty-three deities.
26.4.30	It is equaled by the deities.
26.4.31	It should measure with the metres.
26.4.32	Five cubits are equal to the metre of Pankti.
26.4.33	Six cubits are equal with the metre of Atichhandas.
26.4.34-40	The Shakvara is seven cubits in length. The Gayatri is eight cubits in length The Brihat is nine cubits in length, The Viraja is ten cubits in length; The Tristubh is eleven cubits in length: The Jagati is twelve cubits in length.
26.4.41	The Bṛhat is to be cut off without limit.
26.4.42	The gods went to heaven by means of the sacrificial post, for the attainment of heaven.
26.4.43	One should cut off the one who is older than any man.
26.4.44	This is the measure of the sacrificial post.
26.4.45	One cuts off the sacrificial post as much as it is.
26.4.46	It becomes a cup.
26.4.47	The gods went to the heavenly world from the cup, for the attainment of the heavenly world.
26.4.48	Indra struck Vritra with the thunderbolt.
26.4.49	Of that, as much as was broken off, fell down.
26.4.50	He recovered it in the cup.
26.4.51	The cup is for firmness, for the attainment, for non-loosening.
26.4.52	It is of this size.
26.4.53	This much was found to be the measure.
26.4.54	One should not exceed the height of the sacrificial post.
26.4.55	If one exceeds it, there would be a multitude of diseases.
26.4.56	One should exceed it by the length of the uppermost finger joint.
26.4.57	The height of the sacrificial posts is equal to the height of the animals, to prevent their destruction.
26.4.58	Whatever exceeds the sacrifice, that exceeds the gods who are to be worshipped.
26.4.59-63	What is left over from the sacrificial post is left over from sacrifice. By that he pleases the gods who are to be pleased. If one wants to make a cup from another tree, whose sacrificial post it is, one should do so. If one desires, "May I generate enmity for him," then one should do so for him. The other trees are his enemies.
26.4.64	He makes him ascend the world of his enemy.
26.4.65	He makes him invisible.
26.5.1	He sprinkles the sacrificial post with the formula, "For earth thee, for atmosphere thee, for heaven thee."
26.5.2	He sprinkles it from these worlds.
26.5.3	The post is erected for this world, the Udumbara post for the other world.
26.5.4	Therefore he sprinkles the sacrificial post facing away from here, and the Udumbara facing towards here, for the support of these two worlds.
26.5.5	"He takes up the chisel with the formula, "In the impulse of the divine Savitr."
26.5.6	He takes it up with the deity impelled by Savitr.
26.5.7	" "He says, "I am cutting off the neck of the Rakshas."
26.5.8	Rakshas is the enemy.
26.5.9	He cuts off the neck of his enemy.
26.5.10	"The worlds, the abode of the fathers, are purified." He purifies him.
26.5.11	And whatever harm they do to him while digging, that he appeases.
26.5.12	He sprinkles with barley-seeds.
26.5.13	Barley is food.
26.5.14	The sacrificial post is splendour.
26.5.15	He places food in splendour.
26.5.16	Barley indeed is food.
26.5.17	The sacrificial post is the thunderbolt.
26.5.18	He places the thunderbolt, the food.
26.5.19	"He strews thee on the seat of the Fathers."
26.5.20	If they were to set up this post without grass, it would be a pit.
26.5.21	The plants are in the northern half of this (world).
26.5.22	He sets it up in the northern half.
26.5.23	It is not a pit.
26.5.24	The Yūpa-wood is placed in front of the sacrificer, because it is the leader of the gods.
26.5.25	This is the sacrifice of the Rk, which is not connected with animals.
26.5.26	He anoints it with the skin.
26.5.27	"With ghee, do ye fill the heaven and earth."
26.5.28	He fills the heaven and earth with ghee.
26.5.29	Therefore plants grow without being sown.
26.5.30	"May Savitar, the god, anoint thee with honey."
26.5.31	Honey is indeed the honey of the gods.
26.5.32	He makes him fit for sacrifice, fit for worship.
26.5.33	He releases the cup, saying, "Make the plants well-sprouting."
26.5.34	He makes the plants bear fruit.
26.5.35	Therefore they grow without being sown.
26.5.36	He anoints the Agni-sthana with ghee.
26.5.37	Ghee is indeed brilliance.
26.5.38	The sacrificer is the Agniṣṭha.
26.5.39	He anoints the sacrificer with his own brilliance.
26.5.40	He anoint the entire (body) continuously, for the continuity of brilliance without interruption.
26.5.41	If he hates someone, he should cut off (the anointing) from him.
26.5.42	He diminishes his brilliance.
26.5.43	He should anoint from all sides.
26.5.44	He anoins him from all sides with his own brilliance.
26.5.45	He touches the sky with the front, the atmosphere with the middle, and the earth with the rear.
26.5.46	The sacrificial post is indeed a thunderbolt, for the support of these worlds.
26.5.47	He offers it with the Vaisnavya (verse), "These are your places."
26.5.48	The sacrificial post belongs to Vishnu.
26.5.49	He offers himself with his own deity.
26.5.50	He makes it with the Vāiṣṇavya (verse), 'One sees the deeds of Vishnu.'
26.5.51	The sacrificial post is Vaishnava.
26.5.52	He consecrates it with its own deity.
26.5.53	One should make the Agniṣṭha fire-altar facing the fire.
26.5.54	Fire is brilliance.
26.5.55	The Agniṣṭha is the sacrificer.
26.5.56	He makes the sacrificer flourish with brilliance.
26.5.57	If one hates someone, one should make him bow down in this way or in that way.
26.5.58	He makes him flourish with brilliance.
26.5.59	"He says, 'O Brahman, O Kshatra,' he blesses him with a blessing.
26.5.60	'O Brahman, O Kshatra, be firm,' he blesses the one who is blessed with a blessing. "
26.5.61	'That is Vishnu's supreme abode,' he consecrates himself with the Vedic verse.
26.5.62	The sacrificial post is dedicated to Vishnu.
26.5.63	He consecrates himself with his own deity.
26.6.1	The pit for the sacrificial post should be half within the altar and half outside the altar. The limited and unlimited (space) should be enclosed.
26.6.2	One should not make it visible.
26.6.3	If one were to make it visible, it would be a pit.
26.6.4	One should release it without covering.
26.6.5	If one releases it without covering, the sacrificer would be hungry and the Adhvaryu would be naked.
26.6.6-13	The girdle is strength. He spreads it around the middle. He places strength in the middle, in the sacrificer and in the offspring. Therefore offspring are strong in the middle. One should spread a girdle for him whom one hates. The girdle is strength. It is strength that he weakens. One should carry it upwards or downwards for him whom one dislikes.
26.6.14	The girdle is strength.
26.6.15	He indeed weakens him by strength.
26.6.16	If one desires rain, one should throw it down far above.
26.6.17	When it rains, it rains from the water and plants.
26.6.18	The plants are the girdle.
26.6.19	He makes the plants nearer to the rain.
26.6.20	It rains more.
26.6.21	If one wishes that it should not rain, one should cast it down far below.
26.6.22	When he rains, he rains from the plants.
26.6.23	The plants are the reins.
26.6.24	He makes the plants more distant from the rain.
26.6.25	He rains for a long time.
26.6.26	"You are the surrounding, may the divine classes go around you."
26.6.27	The plants are indeed the divine classes.
26.6.28	The plants, the reins.
26.6.29	The sacrificer is the sacrificial post.
26.6.30	He makes the subjects face the sacrificer.
26.6.31	"He says, "The human being of wealth,"
26.6.32	Wealth is cattle.
26.6.33	He prospers him with cattle.
26.6.34	He takes up the Svara on the "banks of the sky,"
26.6.35	Because this (verse) belongs to the deity of the sky, and now it is above this world and below the other.
26.6.36	He himself takes it up for the deities, above the Fathers, above men.
26.6.37	Above the Fathers.
26.6.38	For the girdle of the plants.
26.6.39	Above the girdle of all the gods, the cup of Indra, the excess of the Sadhyas.
26.6.40	Thus indeed, in these worlds, the Fathers, men, and the gods.
26.6.41	The sacrificial post is dedicated to all the gods.
26.6.42	He thus makes him prosper with all the deities.
26.6.43	One should make the sacrificial post sloping towards the half of the fire, and sloping outside.
26.6.44	By making it slope towards the half of fire, one makes the world for the sacrificer.
26.6.45	By making the post slope outside, one drives away the enemy from the sacrifice.
26.6.46	The gods went to heaven by means of the sacrifice.
26.6.47	They desired, "May no one else attain this world."
26.6.48	They sought the directions.
26.6.49	Because they sought the directions, that is why the sacrificial post is called yūpa.
26.6.50	Having gone to this world, they became hungry.
26.6.51	They knew, "It came here from the other world through giving."
26.6.52	They again gave it to him.
26.6.53	By that he succeeded.
26.6.54	This is the thread of the sacrifice.
26.6.55	This is the highest step.
26.6.56	Just as the thread is stretched from the sun, so the sacrifice is stretched from here.
26.6.57	They used to offer this oblation before the Vrihi-oblation.
26.6.58	When one offers the Svara oblation, it is for the sake of redemption.
26.6.59	He is redeemed, pleased, and having done his own duty, he stands over these worlds.
26.6.60	Let your smoke go to heaven, your flame to the atmosphere, and your ashes to the earth. Svāhā! Thus he sends him to these worlds.
26.7.1	The gods named Sādhyas were the first gods before the gods.
26.7.2	They had nothing of their own.
26.7.3	Having churned out fire, they sat down offering oblations into the fire.
26.7.4	From that fire, animals were born.
26.7.5	Therefore all animals are called Agni-related.
26.7.6	When one offers a sacrifice to an animal after churning out fire, one offers a sacrifice only to a born animal.
26.7.7	And also one does it as it was before.
26.7.8	They say that after offering a sacrifice to ananimal, one should churn out fire.
26.7.9	Agni is all the deities.
26.7.10	All the deities are animals.
26.7.11	One generates (the animal) after offering a sacrifice.
26.7.12	All the Savanas should be performed with animals and with energy.
26.7.13	When they perform with the animal at the morning Savana, it becomes endowed with animals and energy.
26.7.14	When (they perform) with the Dakshina animals at midday, it becomes endowed
26.7.15	with animals and energy. When (they perform) at the third Savana with the other animal, it becomes endowed
26.7.16	All his Soma-pressings become endowed with cattle and strength, for him who knows thus.
26.7.17	For he is honoured from all directions by the cattle.
26.7.18	When they honour him facing east, he conquers the world of the gods.
26.7.19	When they lead him facing north, he conquers this world of men.
26.7.20	When they offer after having gone around to the right, he conquers the world of the Fathers by that.
26.7.21	When they take the oblations in the direction towards the west, he conquers that direction by that.
26.7.22	 When he offers standing upwards, he conquers heaven by that.
26.7.23	The gods went to heaven by means of an animal sacrifice.
26.7.24	They churned out the body.
26.7.25	Heaven is the oblation.
26.7.26	What is done with the Payas at the morning pressing is for the attainment of the heavenly world.
26.7.27	What is done with the other animal at the third pressing is for the redemption of the body.
26.7.28	One should offer with the moist and many-leaved (plants).
26.7.29	Plants are the lords of the forest.
26.7.30	Animals are plants.
26.7.31	He prospers him with animals.
26.7.32	He should make a charm with dry leaves for the one he hates.
26.7.33	Plants are the lords of the forest.
26.7.34	Animals are plants.
26.7.35	He afflicts him with animals.
26.7.36	The thunderbolt is terrible, the other is auspicious.
26.7.37	The dry one is terrible.
26.7.38	The moist one is auspicious.
26.7.39	He makes a charm with the auspicious one.
26.7.40	He places the sacrificial grass.
26.7.41	The sacrificial grass is cattle.
26.7.42	He places cattle for him.
26.7.43	"He says, "You are the covering."
26.7.44	For he covers.
26.7.45	"He goes to the divine clans of the gods."
26.7.46	The divine clans are cattle.
26.7.47	He puts cattle for him.
26.7.48-55	The fires are the Ushis. The fires are the priests, the Ushis. He makes them approach the priests. "O Brihaspati, with the support of wealth." Brihaspati is indeed Brahman. Brahman's offspring are born. He generates them by Brahman. "O divine Tvashtar, in the battle for wealth."
26.7.56	Tvaṣṭr is the creator of forms.
26.7.57	He creates forms for him.
26.7.58	"Rejoice, O Revatī!"
26.7.59	Brahma is Brihaspati.
26.7.60	The Revatī stars are cattle.
26.7.61	He bestows cattle on him through Brahma.
26.7.62	"You are the womb of Agni."
26.7.63	This is indeed the womb of Agni.
26.7.64	"You two are the testicles."
26.7.65	For the offspring are not born from the sky.
26.7.66	"Uruvasi is your life, Pururava is you."
26.7.67	The mother is Uruvasi.
26.7.68	The embryo is life.
26.7.69	The father is Pururava.
26.7.70	Semen is ghee.
26.7.71	When one anoints with ghee, one places semen in the form of a couple.
26.7.72	"Be born in the Gayatri metre, in the Tristubh, in the Jagati."
26.7.73	These are the metres.
26.7.74	Semen is deposited by the metres.
26.7.75	He generates semen for him by means of the metres.
26.7.76	(He moves) towards the south.
26.7.77	This is the generating body of the sun.
26.7.78	He is born in accordance with it.
26.7.79	Now the fires are about to seize the sacrificer.
26.7.80	"May you be favourable to us with your minds." He makes them favourable with their minds.
26.7.81	"Do not injure the lord of sacrifice, do not injure the sacrifice, O Jātavedas." For protection from injury.
26.7.82	"May you be favourable today to us." He makes them indeed favourable.
26.7.83	The paridhi-sticks are worn for the conquest of the Rākṣasas.
26.7.84	He should strike above and above, and make a sacred place for the Rakshas.
26.7.85	He strikes with the joint or with the tip.
26.7.86	He offers with a ladle that is not a sacred place.
26.7.87	He places the share with the two that are joined.
26.8.1	He recites the Savitri verse.
26.8.2	He generates him with the impulse of Savitr.
26.8.3	He recitess the verse dedicated to one deity.
26.8.4	He begets him as one only.
26.8.5	If he were to recite the Dvidevatya (hymn), he would beget a second enemy for him.
26.8.6	He recites on the Dyavapṛthivī (hymn) for the begetting of offspring of offspring.
26.8.7	One should not recite the Dhūmavatī (hymn).
26.8.8	When Indra killed Vṛtra, wherever he was injured,
26.8.9	smoke arose from there.
26.8.10	Or he is born from the dead.
26.8.11	It becomes a source of loss for him.
26.8.12	If it does not come out while being churned, one should recite the Rakṣoghni verse for the destruction of demons.
26.8.13	One should recite the Anāvan verse.
26.8.14	Demons attack the sacrifice with the Avan.
26.8.15	One makes a passage beyond the demons.
26.8.16	One recites the Gayatri verse for a Brahmin.
26.8.17	The Brahman is indeed Gāyatrī.
26.8.18	The Rajanya is indeed Tristubh.
26.8.19	The Rajnya is indeed Tristubha.
26.8.20	The Vaishya is indeed Jagati.
26.8.21	The Vaishy is indeed Jagata.
26.8.22	As per the Chanda.
26.8.23	He takes up the girdle with the words, "In the impulse of the divine Savitr."
26.8.24	He takes it up with the deities impelled by Savitr.
26.8.25	"With the noose of the divine oblation, I release thee from the noose of truth."
26.8.26	The one who is fit for sacrifice and worthy is the noose of Truth.
26.8.27	He releases him with that very (noose).
26.8.28	"For the one who is dear."
26.8.29	He makes it dear to the deity for whom he releases (the animal).
26.8.30	"For those who are human."
26.8.31	The sacrificial post is indeed the thunderbolt.
26.8.32	Animals are human.
26.8.33	He offers the animals to him with the thunderbolt.
26.8.34	This is a constellation, a sacrifice, an impure one.
26.8.35	When he ties up the animal, he makes it pure, fit for sacrifice.
26.8.36	Animals stand before the sacrifice.
26.8.37	The deities are in this (animal).
26.8.38	When they sprinkle the animal facing east, they sprinkle half of the deities.
26.8.39	"From the waters and from the plants."
26.8.40	For the animal is offered to the waters and plants.
26.8.41	He sprinkles it to the waters and the plants.
26.8.42	"May your mother and father approve of you."
26.8.43	For his father and mother are his approvers.
26.8.44	The waters are all the deities.
26.8.45	The animal is dedicated to all the deities.
26.8.46	He thus makes him prosper with all the deities.
26.8.47	The animal indeed becomes impure and unfit for sacrifice.
26.8.48	Water is pure and fit for sacrifice.
26.8.49	When he sprinkles with water, he makes it pure and fit for the sacrifice.
26.8.50	He takes up water, saying, "You are the water-bearer."
26.8.51	The offerings that are inside, he makes them pure.
26.8.52	He sprinkles the chest with the formula, "The oblation for the gods is pure like ghee."
26.8.53	The offerings that are below, he makes them purified.
26.8.54	He sprinkles all around.
26.8.55	He indeed makes him prosperous in all directions.
26.8.56	The pouring down is indeed the head of the sacrifice.
26.8.57	The self is the animal.
26.8.58	Having poured the libation, he anoints the animal. He places the head of the sacrifice in the self.
26.8.59	"May the wind go with your breath."
26.8.60	He makes his breath go to the wind.
26.8.61	"May your limbs go with the Yajatras."
26.8.62	The Yajatras are the deities.
26.8.63	He makes his limbs go to the deities.
26.8.64	"May the lord of sacrifice be blessed." He blesses the sacrificer with a blessing.
26.9.1	He chooses the priests.
26.9.2	The priests are the metres.
26.9.3	He chooses those metres.
26.9.4	With them chosen and yoked, the Vasat-utterances are yoked in front.
26.9.5	He chooses a Hotr.
26.9.6	He chooses that metre, the Jagati.
26.9.7	He chooses an Agnidh.
26.9.8	He chooses the metre of the Pāṅktis.
26.9.9	The Adhvaryu chooses.
26.9.10	He chooses the Atichanda metre.
26.9.11	He chooses between the Hotṛ and the Adhvaryu the Agnidh.
26.9.12	Therefore Agni enters the middle of the plants.
26.9.13	Because he offers the last (oblation), therefore he is born above when churned.
26.9.14	He chooses Maitrāvaruṇa.
26.9.15-22	He chooses the Gayatri metre. He chooses the Brahmacchamsin. He chooses Tristubh metre. He choose the Potar. He chooses Usnih metre. He choosesthe Neshtar. He chooses Kakubh metre. The Anushtubh metre is like the rear.
26.9.23-31	The Acchāvāka is the last of the Hotr priests. Therefore they call the Acchāvākas. They do not choose. Now these are the Apryas. Prajapati, having created the creatures, was afraid of them. He saw these Apryas. With them he appeased himself. The sacrifice is Prajapati. The sacrificer is the self of the sacrifice.
26.9.32-38	Since these are performed in the first half of the sacrifice, he pleases the sacrificer at the very beginning. He offers the Prayāja offerings. The Prayāja offerings are the vital breaths. He offers them to the vital breaths. This is why they are called Prayāja. One should please him whom one desires to live the entire life. The Prayājas are the vital breaths.
26.9.39	He gives back the life-breaths which are not cut off in him.
26.9.40	He attains the whole span of life.
26.9.41	The victim is the self of the animal.
26.9.42	The Apra is the self of (the sacrificer).
26.9.43	The Apra being the last, it is the self which is enclosed (in the Apra). For the continuity of the sacrifice, for the non-interruption (of the sacrifice).
26.9.44	There are eleven Prayajas.
26.9.45	There are eleven Anuyajas.
26.9.46	There is one Upasthya.
26.9.47-51	These are the only deities. The animal is dedicated to all deities. He thus makes it up to all deities. The thirty-three gods drink Soma, the thirty-three do not drink Soma. The eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the twelve Adityas, the Vasat-call and Prajapati, they drink Soma;
26.9.52	The Prajājas, Anuyājas and Upājas are the Soma-drinkers.
26.9.53	Therefore they are performed outside the sacrifice.
26.9.54	By means of Soma he pleases the gods who drink Soma, by means of the animal the Soma-drink-ers.
26.9.55	Both of them are pleased with him at the sacrifice.
26.9.56	This indeed was said by Śyāparṇa Śāyākāyana to Aṣāḍha Kaiśin: "Where he leads him, he leads him to Soma."
26.9.57	If you do not want to go to Soma, you will go with both the gods, those who have Soma and those who do not have Soma.
26.9.58	Your sacrifice will be without gods.
26.9.59	Then they thought, "If they take you to the east, we will follow you there." They took him to the east, thinking, "There is no fear for us."
26.9.60	Then the Kūntas, having attacked the Panchālas, conquer.
26.9.61	He who thus knows Soma, leads him with both gods and non-gods.
26.9.62	His sacrifice becomes without gods.
26.9.63	And also because they lead him to the Rīch.
26.9.64	Having attacked him, they conquer.
26.10.1	The gods and the Asuras were together in the sacrifice.
26.10.2	Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did.
26.10.3	Then the gods saw this Upāṃśu.
26.10.4	They saw that the sacrifice was to be established in it.
26.10.5	They established the sacrifice in it alone.
26.10.6	They drank it eight times.
26.10.7-15	They obtained the Gayatri metre. Eleven times. The Tristubh metre. Twelve times. The Jagati metre. They obtained the three Savanas. The gods, having surrounded the sacrifice, stood up for the Hotr. The Asuras saw them and said, "The gods are offering sacrifices."
26.10.16	He hurled the thunderbolt at them.
26.10.17	The gods hid them from the worlds by means of the Antaryama.
26.10.18	Then the gods became (victorious),
26.10.19	the Asuras became (defeated).
26.10.20	For him who knows thus, and offers silently, and for him who knows thus and offers, he hides his enemy from these worlds.
26.10.21	He becomes (victorious) by himself.
26.10.22	His enemy becomes his brother.
26.10.23	Then indeed, Haruna Aupaveshi said, "Why should one perform a sacrifice who knows that the sacrifice is to be established in the Upamshus?"
26.10.24	He sprinkles eight times.
26.10.25	He attains that metre, the Gayatri.
26.10.26	Eleven times.
26.10.27	That is the Tristubh.
26.10.28	Twelve times.
26.10.29	That becomes the Jagati.
26.10.30	He takes it three times.
26.10.31	He thus obtains the Savanas.
26.10.32	Having thus established the sacrifice with the Upamshus, he proceeds with it, established, without injury, without harm.
26.10.33	One should take eight (measures) for one desiring Brahmic glory.
26.10.34	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
26.10.35	He thus establishes the Gayatri at the mouth of the sacrifice.
26.10.36	Herein, in the Gayatri, in the heaven, in his own womb, in the heavenly world, the mouth of sacrifice is stretched.
26.10.37	He who knows this becomes the chief.
26.10.38	One should say, "You are taken with the Upāman."
26.10.39	This is the Upāman.
26.10.40	By this one could even kill the vital breaths.
26.10.41	They do not spread the filter.
26.10.42	The filter is indeed the atmosphere.
26.10.43	If one were to take the vital breaths in the atmosphere, one would die.
26.10.44	This indeed is the one who blows, he is the vital breath.
26.10.45	We take this vital breath from him.
26.10.46	If one says, "You are taken by the one who is not taken," then they do not spread the purifying grass.
26.10.47	Therefore this is not taken, it blows in this way and that way as it pleases.
26.10.48	Therefore we take the vital breath as we please.
26.10.49-56	The Upāṁshu is the sanctification of the vital airs. He sanctifies him with the vital airs. He takes six strands. Therefore the vital airs are six. He sanctifies in pairs. Therefore the pairs of vital airs. From the Upāṁshu-savan he takes the Upāṁshus. The Upāṁshu savan is the vital air. The Upăṁshu is the vital air.
26.10.57	He restrains the breath from the breath itself.
26.10.58	The Upāṁshusavana is the northern one, the Aṁshas are the southern ones.
26.10.59	The Upăṁshusavana indeed is the breath,
26.10.60	the Aṁshas indeed are the offspring.
26.10.61	He places the breath in the offspring.
26.10.62	Therefore the breath is the highest.
27.1.1	"Do thou flow for the lord of speech," he says; "Do thou flow for lordship over speech," is what he means to say.
27.1.2	Therefore, we speak with this (speech) and go forth.
27.1.3	Prajapati was here.
27.1.4	His second was speech.
27.1.5	They became a couple.
27.1.6	She conceived.
27.1.7	She went away from him.
27.1.8	She created these beings.
27.1.9	She again entered Prajapati.
27.1.10	O lord of speech, flow for him.
27.1.11	From this very pair, one is born with offspring and cattle.
27.1.12	"Flow for Vācaspati."
27.1.13	Brahma is Vācaspati.
27.1.14	He purifies him with Brahma.
27.1.15	"Flow through the rays of the bull, purified by the rays."
27.1.16	Indra is the bull, his hands are the rays.
27.1.17	He putifies him with them.
27.1.18	"The god is the purifier of the gods."
27.1.19	He directs him to the deities.
27.1.20	"The Soma-pressers have pressed the Soma, the sweet juice, for the gods."
27.1.21	"The Soma has been pressed for the gods." The Soma-pressers are pressing the Soma, the juice, for the deities.
27.1.22	He directs him towards the deities.
27.1.23	The Soma-presser is pressing the Soma, sweet juice, for you.
27.1.24	The deities are the Soma-pressers.
27.1.25	He makes him sweet for the deities.
27.1.26	"You are mine."
27.1.27	He makes the breath his own.
27.1.28	"He says, 'Take away the earth.'
27.1.29	For this (breath) is now connected with the deity of the atmosphere.
27.1.30	"To all the senses."
27.1.31	He places the breath in the gods and men.
27.1.32	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, 'May you be satisfied with the mind.'
27.1.33	For the breath is held by the mind.
27.1.34	"He offers with, 'Svāhā to you, the good, for the sun.'
27.1.35	Soma is indeed the good.
27.1.36	In that sun, the bodies of the gods are dear.
27.1.37	He indeed propitiates them.
27.1.38	And with the word svāhā, he offers oblations in this (world).
27.1.39	He offers everything as oblation.
27.1.40	Therefore, the breath goes beyond.
27.1.41	He offers while standing straight.
27.1.42	The sacrifice is indeed equal to a man.
27.1.43	The man is pervaded by the Prāṇāpāna (breath). The Prāṇāpaṇas are not mixed.
27.1.44	The Adhvaryu does not wander who knows thus.
27.1.45	One should offer the Upāṁśu from the north and the Antaryāma from the south.
27.1.46	This sacrifice is indeed the chariot of the gods.
27.1.47	Its two reins are the Upāṁshu and Antaryāma.
27.1.48	The rays of the divine chariot move in front of the chariot for the establishment of the year and for the recognition of the heavenly world.
27.1.49	The rays of the human chariot move in imitation of that.
27.1.50	They should be drawn straight for the uninterrupted flow of the vital breaths.
27.1.51	If one desires, "May it not rain," one should wipe upwards.
27.1.52	One thus restrains the rain there itself.
27.1.53	If one desires rain, one should sprinkle the lower part.
27.1.54	Whatever oblation is offered from here, it causes rain to fall from the ocean.
27.1.55	By offering to Soma, one causes rain to fall down from the sky.
27.1.56	One sprinkles on the boundary with the words, "To the gods who are the rays."
27.1.57	The gods who are the breath are the rays.
27.1.58	He pleases them.
27.1.59	Now this is indeed the Soma-drink of the enclosing sticks.
27.1.60	He cleanses within.
27.1.61	Therefore the vital airs are within.
27.1.62	He who causes the sacrifice to come to a halt before the pressing, he indeed severs the sacrifice.
27.1.63	When he sprinkles the strands that have not been pressed, it is for the continuity of the sacrifice without interruption.
27.1.64	He sprinkles six strands.
27.1.65-70	Therefore, the Prāṇas are six. The Dvandva. Therefore, the Prānas are the Dvandva. They are moist and not united. Therefore, when the Prāṇās are moist, they are not united. He who knows the drinking of Soma, does not fall away from the drinking of Soma; his progeny does not fall away.
27.1.71	"That is thy name, O Soma, which is Jagrvi. To that, O Soma, to Soma, svāhā."
27.1.72	This indeed is Soma's drinking of Soma.
27.1.73	He thus satisfies Soma with Soma.
27.1.74	He who knows this does not fall away from the drinking of Soma, nor does his progeny.
27.1.75	If he were to perform the rite, he should take it with the formula, "I take thee in the impulse of Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan."
27.1.76	"May you be pleased with the intoxication of the Madhu wine. Then I shall offer you." He makes him truthful.
27.1.77	Soma is indeed of all deities.
27.1.78	All deities now desire him.
27.1.79	"He will offer for me, he will offer for me."
27.1.80	The deities, desiring the oblation, burn him.
27.1.81	He stands near it.
27.1.82	He goes to the end of his breath.
27.1.83	When he speaks the yajus, he turns him over to the gods.
27.1.84	He recites in a low voice.
27.1.85	Breath is low-voiced.
27.1.86	He recits in a low voice, he turns his breath over to his breath.
27.1.87	The sun shines forth.
27.2.1	The gods, having pressed Soma, could not find a vessel with which to pour it out.
27.2.2	They saw this very vessel of the gods.
27.2.3	They poured it out with this very (vessel).
27.2.4	This indeed is the vessel of the gods,
27.2.5	They make pots of it, it is the wind-vessel.
27.2.6	He who knows thus obtains the vessel of the best.
27.2.7	The Brahman should be examined in the vessel.
27.2.8	That is the vow.
27.2.9	"You are taken with the Upāṁsu-graha."
27.2.10	This is the Upāṁsa.
27.2.11	Whatever is scattered here, that is collected by it.
27.2.12	Soma does not scatter for one who knows this.
27.2.13	"You have been taken with the Upāyaṁsu-grah."
27.2.14	For Soma is taken with the Upayama-graha.
27.2.15	They spread the filter.
27.2.16	Soma becomes pure and sacred by this.
27.2.17	Svābhānu, the demon, covered the sun with darkness.
27.2.18	It did not shine.
27.2.19	Therefore the gods removed the darkness.
27.2.20	What they removed first became the dark Aiviṣa, what they removed second became the pale Phalgu, what they removed third became the weak Balakṣī.
27.2.21	Therefore they make it sacred.
27.2.22	He purifies him with the body of the sun itself.
27.2.23	"He makes his enemy disappear from these worlds by saying, "O Maghavan, protect the Soma from within."
27.2.24	"He makes the Soma-juice sweet by saying, "Make the Iṣa sweet."
27.2.25	The Iṣa is the deity.
27.2.26	He makes it sweet for the gods.
27.2.27	"He says, "You are your own," making the Apāna (breath) its own."
27.2.28	"O Urva, do thou sprinkle the atmosphere."
27.2.29	For this (verse) is addressed to the deity of the atmosphere.
27.2.30	"To all the senses."
27.2.31	He thus provides a means of escape for the gods and men.
27.2.32	"O mind, to Tvashtra."
27.2.33	For the mind holds the breath.
27.2.34	"Svāhā to thee, O Su-bhū, to Surya."
27.2.35	Su-bhū is Soma.
27.2.36	In that sun the dear bodies of the gods are, he propitiates them.
27.2.37	And with the word svāhā he offers oblations in this (world).
27.2.38	One should perform the Soma-pressing in the Antaryāma vessel.
27.2.39	Soma is indeed strength.
27.2.40	Antaryāma is the atmosphere.
27.2.41	He places the sap in the atmosphere, the strength in the animals.
27.2.42	The animals are born after the Upāṃśu and Antaryāma Grahas, and other beings after the other Grahas.
27.2.43	He offers them in the Asanna (graha).
27.2.44	Therefore animals are born in the Asanna place.
27.2.45	Therefore animals born on the same day stand firm. A man is born in a year.
27.2.46	He places the Upāṃśu-vessel with the formula, "For Prāṇa thee." The Upāṃśusavana with the formula, “For Vyāna thee.” The Antaryāma-vessel with the verse, “For Apāna thee.”
27.2.47	Vyāna indeed supports these two, Prāṇa and Apāna, in front and behind, so that they do not perish.
27.2.48	This one does not go upwards.
27.2.49	The other one does not go downwards.
27.2.50	He places Vyāna in the middle for the support of Prāṇa and Āpāna.
27.2.51	The Śṛṅga is the Upaṃśu.
27.2.52	The Antaryāma is the Indriya.
27.2.53	The Prajā is the Soma-drink.
27.2.54	Indeed, those two are the two cups which the Rājanya Kauṇeya used to drink. When he drinks the Śṛṅga, he thinks that he is drinking the two cups.
27.2.55	When these two are performed in the first half of the sacrifice, he places the couple at the mouth of the sacrifice for procreation.
27.2.56	Therefore they say, "Praṇa and Apana are the progenitors of progeny."
27.2.57	The sacrifice is equal to a man.
27.2.58	A man is continuous through Praṇa and Apana.
27.2.59	When these two lie down before the third pressing, he makes the sacrifice continuous through Praṇa-Apana.
27.2.60	Therefore, from that sleeping man, Praṇa and Apāna do not depart.
27.2.61	They are employed again at the third pressing.
27.2.62	Therefore, having slept, one awakens.
27.2.63	Therefore, the two downward-moving breaths.
27.3.1	Prāṇa is Upāṃśu.
27.3.2	Apāna is Antarāma.
27.3.3	Speech is Indra-Vāyu.
27.3.4	When Upāṃśa, Antarāma, and Indra-Vāayu are employed, he places speech above Prāṇa and Apāna.
27.3.5	Therefore, the person who breathes in and out speaks.
27.3.6	The gods were unable to lift up the morning pressing.
27.3.7	Then the wind was at the third pressing.
27.3.8	The gods removed it towards the east.
27.3.9	The wind is Prāṇa.
27.3.10	The sacrifice is Indra's.
27.3.11	The Indra-Vayu cup is taken at the morning pressing. Having thus taken the sacrifice by means of the breath, they carry it forward.
27.3.12	This was formerly the Vayu cup.
27.3.13	Speech having been created did not turn back. It went on.
27.3.14	Indra said, "Let it be taken for me also.
27.3.15	I shall turn it back."
27.3.16	Then they took up this Indra-Vayu Soma.
27.3.17	This speech, having been turned away by the sense-organ, speaks.
27.3.18	This Soma is taken for the turning away of speech.
27.3.19	He who knows this speaks, having turned away from evil.
27.3.20	When the progeny was created, they quarrelled.
27.3.21	They were not able to breathe in and out, nor to breathe out and in.
27.3.22	Indra said, "Let me also have a share in this."
27.3.23	"I will give you these two, Prāṇa and Apāna."
27.3.24	Then he took the Indra-Vāyu offering.
27.3.25	"Recite for Indra-Vāyus."
27.3.26	He places Indra in the middle, Vāyu around, for the support of Prāṇa and Āpāna.
27.3.27	Vāyu is the Prāṇa,
27.3.28	Or, these two, Prāṇa and Apāna, are held by Vyāna, and do not perish in front and behind.
27.3.29	This one does not go upwards.
27.3.30	The other one does not go downwards.
27.3.31	It holds Vyāna in the middle for the support of Prāṇa and Āpāna.
27.3.32	It is taken three times.
27.3.33	Therefore, speech speaks three times slowly, loudly, and very loudly.
27.3.34	The gods said to Vayu, "We shall slay Vritra with your mouth."
27.3.35	He said, "I choose a boon."
27.3.36	"The Grahas should be taken with you as the first."
27.3.37	Therefore the Grahas are taken with Vayu as the first.
27.3.38	For he is protected by Vayu.
27.3.39	Indra said, "Let me also be taken here.
27.3.40-47	Then they said, "We will indeed perform the sacrifice." They took up this Indra-Vayu Soma. Then they killed Vritra. This Soma is taken for victory over Vritra. He is the slayer of Vritra. Soma is Vritra. When he was killed, he became impure. The gods said to Vayu, "Do this for us." He said, "I choose a boon."
27.3.48	The vessels are to be used by those who have the deity Madhu.
27.3.49	He (the Adhvaryu) removes it.
27.3.50	From that he removes the odour.
27.3.51	This is the odour of the animal that has died.
27.3.52	Therefore, it is not to be taken.
27.3.53	For this is the odour of Soma, the king.
27.3.54	The king of consumption does not find him who knows thus.
27.3.55	From that, the oyster is born.
27.3.56	Therefore, the third vessel belongs to Vayu.
27.3.57	Now, the offerings to Vayu are mentioned.
27.3.58	Because they are surrounded by water.
27.4.1	In ancient times, Soma was taken by two different gods, Mitra and Varuna.
27.4.2	Those beings became restless, uncontrolled, and began to harm each other.
27.4.3	The gods said, "Let us take him together with Mitra and Varuna."
27.4.4	"Let us appease Mitra with Varuna and Varuna with Mitra."
27.4.5	Then they took him together.
27.4.6	They appeased Mitra with Varuna, and Varuna with Mitr
27.4.7	These creatures were appeased by Mitra and held by Varuna.
27.4.8	The Maitrāvaruṇa is taken up for the sake of the established (rites).
27.4.9	The gods said to Mitra, "Do thou slay Vṛtra."
27.4.10	He said, "No."
27.4.11	"I am Mitra."
27.4.12	"Do not slay."
27.4.13	They said, "We shall slay."
27.4.14	He said (to them), "I choose a boon.
27.4.15	Let Soma be offered with milk."
27.4.16	Therefore they offer to Mitra-Varuna with milk.
27.4.17	For he is surrounded by the waters.
27.4.18	Then they killed Vritra.
27.4.19	Therefore they kill a Vaishya with a king as their overseer.
27.4.20	While he was Mitra, he did an untruthful deed. Varuna seized him.
27.4.21	The cattle fled.
27.4.22	He was helpless, and Mitra was Varuna.
27.4.23-29	He said, "Let us take Soma together." "Then I will release you." Then they took him together. With that he released him from Varuna. When the Maitrāvaruṇa takes (Soma), it is for release from Varuna. The animals are the milk. For animals are the milk.
27.4.30	When he offers the Maitrāvaruṇa cup with milk, he makes him prosper with cattle.
27.4.31	They say, "This is not Soma."
27.4.32	These are plants.
27.4.33	Milk is Soma.
27.4.34	When he offers the Maitravaruna cup with milk, it makes him Soma.
27.4.35	And also what they do to him as a final blow, and what they do to make him fierce, that he appeases.
27.4.36	He gratifies with the cooked (rice).
27.4.37	The cooked (rice) is friendly.
27.4.38	The counter-offering is Varuna's.
27.4.39	He reconciles them with their own share.
27.4.40	The Brahman is friendly.
27.4.41	Varuna is royal.
27.4.42	Since the Maitravaruna is taken, therefore the Brahman is the priest of the king.
27.4.43	The head of the sacrifice was cut off.
27.4.44	Then indeed the Asvins, the physicians of the gods, were not drinkers of Soma.
27.4.45	The gods said to them, "You are physicians."
27.4.46	"Place this head of the sacrifice around."
27.4.47	They said, "We choose a boon.
27.4.48	Let us drink Soma among the gods.
27.4.49	Let us be taken as a Graha."
27.4.50	Having purified them with the Bahispavamāna, they took up the cup with them, being pure and worthy.
27.4.51	Therefore, the Ashvina is taken up after the Bahispavamaṇa is praised.
27.4.52	Therefore, a brahmana should sit during the Bahispavana.
27.4.53	Because it is sacred.
27.4.54	Therefore, one should exclude the one whom he hates from the Bahispavamāna.
27.4.55	He excludes him from the Pavitra itself.
27.4.56	When they returned to the gods, the one who was the healer among them
27.4.57	divided it into three parts: one part in the fire, one part in the Brahmanas, and one part in the water.
27.4.58	He for whom one desires, "May he live without sickness," should tell the Brahman at the end of the Agnihotra and then recite the water-verses.
27.4.59	This is the only remedy.
27.4.60	He makes it only as much as is the remedy.
27.4.61	He lives.
27.4.62	He attains the whole life.
27.4.63	He does not die before his time.
27.5.1	The two-deity sacrifices are the vital airs.
27.5.2	The vessels are taken as one.
27.5.3	Therefore the Prāṇas are of one name.
27.5.4	They are offered in two vessels.
27.5.5	Therefore the Prāṇās are in pairs.
27.5.6	With which Yajus he gives, with that he receives, for the continuity and the promise of the Prāṇā.
27.5.7	He does not say 'anuṣṭaka'.
27.5.8	If he were to say 'anuṣtaka', he would establish the Prāṇás and would perish.
27.5.9	Because he does not offer to them, therefore the vital airs move both hither and thither, not remaining in one place.
27.5.10	They discuss whether the two-deity offerings should be eaten first or the Iḍa-offerings.
27.5.11	The Iḍa-offering should be eaten first, because the sacrifice is to be as it was before.
27.5.12	The two-deity offering is the vital airs.
27.5.13	The Ida-offering is the cattle.
27.5.14	If one were to do so, he would obstruct the vital airs with cattle and would perish.
27.5.15	The two-deity offerings should be consumed first.
27.5.16	The vital airs are in the middle, the animals are outside.
27.5.17	Having placed the vital airs within himself, he invokes the animals.
27.5.18	Those vital airs in a man, they are the two-deity (offerings): speech and vital airs are the offerings to Indra and Vayu, eye and mind are the offerings to Mitra and Varuna, ear and self are the offerings to the Asvins.
27.5.19	Agni was the Hotar.
27.5.20-27	He became pale at the Vasat-call. He became pale at the Ida-call. The gods then approached him with the offerings to the two deities. The two deities are the vital airs. They approached him with the vital airs. He accepted it, saying, "Ida is called." The two deities is the vital airs. When one eats the offerings to the tw deities, one approaches oneself with the vital airs.
27.5.28	Therefore, the two deities should be consumed first.
27.5.29	Because they are consumed first.
27.5.30	The tenth day of the month of Ashvina is observed.
27.5.31	Because there are ten vital airs.
27.5.32	He offers it as the third.
27.5.33	He brings the vital airs together at the head.
27.5.34	Having gone around completely, he consumes.
27.5.35	Ashvina is the ear.
27.5.36	Therefore, a person hears from all directions.
27.5.37	The Rakshas follow the empty vessel at the sacrifice.
27.5.38	He places the cake of Indra-Vayu in the vessel of Indra-Vâyu, the milk-rice of Mitra-Varuna in the vessel of Mitra-Varuṇa, and the cooked barley-grains of the Asvins under the vessel of the Asvins, for the removal of Rakshas.
27.5.39	Therefore the vital airs are placed below, empty.
27.5.40	He places it below the southern Havirdhâna.
27.5.41	This is the Agni-part and the Vīrya-part of these two.
27.5.42	He places it in the Agni-part, in the Vīrya part.
27.5.43	The sacrifice is equal to a man.
27.5.44	A man is equal to the Prāṇāpānas.
27.5.45	If he were to omit these Prāṇāpaṇas from the morning pressing till the third pressing, he would be equalizing the sacrifice with a non-man.
27.5.46	and with one (verse) and with ten (verses) he releases them.
27.5.47	If he releases them before, he would cut off the life-breath.
27.5.48	If he exceeds them, he would die.
27.5.49	The life-breath is indeed the wind.
27.5.50	The life breaths are the two-deity (verses).
27.5.51	He releases the life-breaths with the life-breath itself.
27.5.52	There is much that is dedicated to Vayu at the morning pressing, but only one at the third pressing.
27.5.53	Therefore many are the breath-owners of the mouth, one is the breath-owner of the lower part.
27.5.54	If he should desire that the one who is not yet known should be known, and the one who is known should be known; then he should say, "O Adhvaryu, I am taking this one, the son of so-and-so, the grandson of so-and so, the descendant of so-andso, from the house of so-and -so."
27.5.55	"This one, I am taking away from the house of so-and-so, the son of so-and so, from the house of the so-and-sos." The Adhvaryu should take away the vessel of the Pratiprasthātṛ.
27.5.56	The Adhvaryu is superior.
27.5.57	The Pratiprasthātr is inferior.
27.5.58	He takes away what has been taken away.
27.5.59	He takes back what has been taken.
27.5.60	They go away separately.
27.5.61	He should take away the vessels.
27.5.62	If he should desire, "May the one who is worse be worse," then he should place the Adhvaryu's vessels in the world of the Pratiprasthātṛ's vessels.
27.5.63	He should place the Pratiprasthatṛ's vessels in world of the Adhvaryus vessels.
27.5.64	The Adhvaryu is superior.
27.5.65	The Pratiprasthātr is inferior.
27.5.66	He places the one who is inferior in the world of one who is superior.
27.5.67	He places one who is superior in the world of an inferior.
27.5.68	He makes the sacrifice a sin-destroying one.
27.5.69	This indeed is what Vipujan Sauraki knew, that he made the sacrifice a sin destroying one.
27.6.1	If one wishes to make one's enemy, the non-sacrificer, the younger brother of the sacrificer, the Pratiprasthātṛ should take the former (portion) and cook it first.
27.6.2	The sacrificer is superior.
27.6.3	The enemy, the non sacrificer, is inferior.
27.6.4-11	He makes his brotherly rival go before him. He offers while standing in the Adhvaryu's world. The Adhvaryu is superior. The Pratiprasthātṛ is inferior. He ascends his brotherly rival's world. He makes him a worldless one. If he does not call out, the Adhvaryu would be without a foundation.
27.6.12	The Adhvaryu should call out the vessel that is to be offered.
27.6.13	This is the Adhvaryu's own.
27.6.14	It would be his own.
27.6.15	Where the first offering is made, one should offer the subsequent ones.
27.6.16	Where the initial offering is made, the deities enter there.
27.6.17	If one were to offer elsewhere, one would cause discord among the deities.
27.6.18	He gives a share to the gods himself.
27.6.19	The two fires were formerly different, the Āhavanīya and the Pāśu.
27.6.20	Therefore, formerly Rudra killed the cattle.
27.6.21	Cattle are cattle.
27.6.22	Cattle (are) portions.
27.6.23	Rudra is Agni.
27.6.24	When he mixes the oblations, he gives cattle to Rudra.
27.6.25	He becomes without cattle.
27.6.26	Therefore now Rudra is the slayer of cattle.
27.6.27	One should offer oblations of ghee and oblations of cattle around the oblations of Soma in the middle of the fire.
27.6.28	He encircles Rudra with cattle.
27.6.29	Rudra becomes the non-slayer of cattle where there is a priest who knows this.
27.7.1	"Let life be joined, let breath be joined." He joins the breaths.
27.7.2	Therefore the breaths are in pairs.
27.7.3	"They have come together during the day on earth." He makes these worlds prosper.
27.7.4	"The banished Shanda and Marka, with him whom we hate."
27.7.5	This is the extent of the sacrifice, as far as Shukra and Manthin.
27.7.6	This is the size of the earth, as far as the northern altar.
27.7.7	Falsehood is the Sandamarka.
27.7.8	Falsehood is the enemy.
27.7.9	Falsehood and the enemy are separated by this much from the sacrifice and from the earth.
27.7.10	"You are the foundation of the bright, you are the foundation of what is to be churned." They offer into the kindled fire.
27.7.11	Agni was afraid of being consumed by the oblation.
27.7.12	When the two oblations are offered in the ladle, it is for non-dripping.
27.7.13	The two oblations, namely, the Sukra and the Manthin, are the eyes of the sacrifice.
27.7.14	When the two oblations (are offered) in the ladle, they are offered within the eyes for non-burning.
27.7.15	Therefore one offers the Soma to Indra and the Soma to Surya, for the separation of the eyes.
27.7.16	Therefore, the eye is the same in both.
27.7.17	They offer to all the fires.
27.7.18	They bestow the eye on all creatures.
27.7.19	He who knows the pairing of the vessels, the cups, and the Soma, from that very pairing he is born.
27.7.20	They take other cups with the Sthalis, others with the Vayu offerings.
27.7.21	That is the pairing of the cups.
27.7.22	The others listen to the others.
27.7.23	That is the union of the Grahas.
27.7.24	The others are blessed, not the others.
27.7.25	This is the union of Soma.
27.7.26	From that union alone is born.
27.8.1	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a battle.
27.8.2	Brihaspati was the priest of the gods and Chandamarka was the priest of Asuras.
27.8.3	They did not conquer.
27.8.4	Indra knew that both of them were endowed with Brahman.
27.8.5	They did not conquer."
27.8.6	He invited them.
27.8.7	They said, "We choose a boon.
27.8.8	Let us drink Soma together among the gods.
27.8.9	Let us be taken together in the Grahas."
27.8.10	Indra gave these two to the Asuras and Brahmas, his own sons.
27.8.11	That is their share.
27.8.12	Therefore a kingdom without a priest is destroyed.
27.8.13	Therefore one should speak untruth to one's enemy.
27.8.14	He thought, 'If I were to sacrifice to these two, the Asuras and the Brahmas, they would follow me.'
27.8.15	"What I shall not do, that will happen to me."
27.8.16	He takes them, saying, "I drive away, I drive away the Sandamarka, together with him whom I hate."
27.8.17	Then the gods became (victorious),
27.8.18	the Asuras became (defeated).
27.8.19	For him who knows thus, the Soma and the Ammani are offered. For him who knows thus they are offered, for the driving away of his foe.
27.8.20	One becomes one's own self.
27.8.21	His enemy is destroyed.
27.8.22	Prajapati's eye was injured.
27.8.23	His pupil fell down.
27.8.24	It entered the Vikankata (plant).
27.8.25	It was not found there.
27.8.26	It entered Yava (barley).
27.8.27	It was found there.
27.8.28	The vessel of the Vikankata plant is made of barley.
27.8.29	He grinds with barley flour.
27.8.30	He collects the eye of Prajapati.
27.8.31	Sukra is connected with the deity of the sacrificer.
27.8.32	Manthi is connected with the enemy deity.
27.8.33	He anoints Sukra with gold.
27.8.34	Gold is brilliance.
27.8.35	He makes the sacrificer flourish with brilliance.
27.8.36	Therefore, one of the two eyes is more brilliant.
27.8.37	Therefore, the day is of one form.
27.8.38	He grinds the Manthin with flour.
27.8.39	He thus subdues his enemy's brilliance.
27.8.40	Therefore the night has many forms.
27.8.41	He should grind the other vessels without breaking them.
27.8.42	If he breaks them, the sacrificer would suffer from eye-disease, blindness and death.
27.8.43	The Shukra and Manthin are indeed the eyes of Prajapati.
27.8.44	Sacrifice is Prajapati.
27.8.45	When they offer, having rushed forward, they place the eyes in the two Savanas.
27.8.46	Therefore, the two Savanas are bright.
27.8.47	The bright one is the sun.
27.8.48	The bright-shining one is the moon.
27.8.49	When they rush forward, having seized, they do not see these two moving forward.
27.8.50	When they offer standing facing each other, they see them going towards the east.
27.8.51	The gods drove away the Asuras with offerings going towards the east,
27.8.52	and the others with offerings going towards west. Standing facing each other, Shukra and Manthin offer. The other offerings are offered going towards the east for the purpose of driving away the enemy.
27.8.53	These two men are not worthy of falling away.
27.8.54	Thou art Tutha, the giver of people.
27.8.55	May the gods, the givers of semen, lead thee.
27.8.56	Thou art the Tutha, the bestower of people.
27.8.57	The gods, the givera of semen, lead you."
27.8.58	He leads them with their own deity.
27.8.59	Go forth, begetting offspring of good heroes.
27.8.60	May he beget offspring, may he beget offspring.
27.8.61	He places the hero among the offspring, the first among the offspring.
27.8.62	Therefore a hero is born among them.
27.8.63	Therefore the others, being born, do not perish.
27.8.64	The offspring of the Anvitris are born from semen, the first from milk.
27.8.65	Agni is the begetter.
27.8.66	Having gone round the fire, they offer. They thus generate both the present and the future progeny.
27.8.67	They should go around the Uttaravedi with the right side towards it.
27.8.68	His limbs become well-shaped and well-nourished.
27.8.69	This is the nose of Prajapati, the Uttaravedi. The Sukra and Manthina are the eyes. Prajapati is the sacrifice.
27.8.70-75	The two eyes are placed in front of the nose, because the two eyes are placed on either side of the nose. Because this is the first part of the nose. The two eyes are offered to while standing on either side of it. Therefore the eyes are on either side of nose. The two eyes are offered while standing on either sides of the nose. Therefore the eyes are on the sides of the nose.
27.9.1	The gods and the Asuras were together in the sacrifice.
27.9.2	Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did.
27.9.3	The Asuras were more, better.
27.9.4	The gods were less, worse, like younger brothers.
27.9.5	The gods saw this Aggrayan.
27.9.6	They took it.
27.9.7	With it they went to the front.
27.9.8-12	The reason why the Agrāyaṇa is called Agrāyaṇa, is that it is the foremost of the offerings. He who is the youngest of the brothers should take it. "If Saramā knows the great path of the mountain, the ancient, the same as before, who leads the foremost of the moving beings, the foremost of the singers, the foremost of those who know, the foremost of all, the foremost of gods, the foremost of men, the foremost of cattle, the foremost of birds, the foremost of beasts, the foremost of animals, the foremost of beings, the foremost in the sky, the foremost in heaven, the foremost in earth, the foremost in water, the foremost in plants, the foremost in trees, the foremost in herbs, the foremost in grasses, the foremost in grains, the foremost in fruits, the foremost in food, the foremost in drink, the foremost in wealth, the foremost in cattle, the foremost in gold, the foremost in silver, the foremost in copper, the foremost in iron, the foremost in lead, the foremost in tin, the foremost in bronze, the foremost in wood, the foremost in stone, the foremost in clay, the foremost in gems, the foremost in jewels, the foremost in pearls, the foremost in corals, the foremost in shells, the foremost in lapis lazuli, the foremost in crystal, the foremost in red pearls, the foremost of everything, the foremost of what is not everything, the foremost in everything, the foremost that is not everything, she is the foremost of all." With this verse, the Agrāyaṇas are taken.
27.9.13	He goes around the oblation-vessel, having placed it in front of his enemy.
27.9.14	Speech indeed went away from the gods, desiring a share in the sacrifice.
27.9.15	The gods then extended this much of the sacrifice in their minds.
27.9.16	"They said, "It is coming back to us."
27.9.17	Having taken the Aghamarana, he releases speech. He yokes speech, which has come back, to the sacrifice.
27.9.18	The sacrifice is like a deer, and the Aggrayan is the soul of the sacrifice.
27.9.19	When he restrains speech, he approaches the sacrifice.
27.9.20	 When he releases it, he approaches the rite.
27.9.21	Aggrayan is Prajapati.
27.9.22	These three priests are appointed for him: the Prastotar, the Udgatar, and the Pratihartar.
27.9.23	When he makes the offering, he chooses the Udgātṛs.
27.9.24	They are chosen and yoked for the sacrifice.
27.9.25	At the morning pressing he takes up from two streams, at midday from three, at the third pressing from four.
27.9.26	There are nine vital airs in man.
27.9.27	The Āgrayana is the self of the sacrifice.
27.9.28	He attains the self and the vital airs.
27.9.29	They indeed cut off the sacrifice when they establish the Savanas separately.
27.9.30	Agniravan is the self of the sacrifice.
27.9.31	When he takes up the Agniravan at each Savana, he sustains the sacrifice with its own self.
27.9.32	"The gods who are eleven in heaven." He sustains the sacrifice with the thirty-three deities.
27.9.33	Prajapati is the Aggrayan.
27.9.34	When he sprinkles, he places the semen.
27.9.35	When he takes it up, he generates it.
27.9.36	He takes it up in a vessel.
27.9.37	It is not known by whom he will offer.
27.9.38	Therefore, one who kills a fetus that is not known is a murderer.
27.9.39	He takes up in a vessel
27.9.40	He offers with the Vayu-offering.
27.9.41	Therefore, a woman is born without the power of a man.
27.9.42	They pour out the pot for Parā, not for Vāyu.
27.9.43	Therefore, they pour out a woman, not a man.
27.9.44	If the Graha is lost, one should take it from the Āgrayana.
27.9.45	If the Āgrayana is lost, one takes it from the Grahas.
27.9.46	The Āgrayana is the father.
27.9.47	The Grahas are the sons.
27.9.48	The son who is born to a father, runs to him.
27.9.49	This Soma is indeed taken for atonement.
27.9.50	The Brahmanas say: Why does the Gayatri, which is not deficient, return and carry all the Savanas?
27.9.51	The Aggrayan Soma is indeed the calf of the Gayatri.
27.9.52	Because he takes the Āgrayana at each pressing, therefore the Gāyatrī is not exhausted and carries all the pressings.
27.9.53	Therefore a cow, when taken away from her calf, returns again.
27.9.54	Prajapati, having created the creatures, made them cry out.
27.9.55	Prajapate is Āgrayana.
27.9.56	When he takes up the Aggrayaṇa and utters the sound "hiṅ", therefore a cow utters the sound when her calf is born.
27.10.1	Indra indeed hurled the thunderbolt at Vritra.
27.10.2	He said, "This power is in me.
27.10.3	I shall give it to you.
27.10.4	Do not strike me."
27.10.5	He gave it to him.
27.10.6	He knew, "There is indeed power in this."
27.10.7	He gave him the second, he gave him the third.
27.10.8	He said, "There is power in me indeed."
27.10.9	I will give it to you.
27.10.10	Do not strike me."
27.10.11	He gave it to him.
27.10.12	He gave him indeed the sacrifice, the Ukthya.
27.10.13-17	This is the extent of the sacrifice, as much as the Ukthya. The other Grahas are taken for the final pressing. He gave it three times. Therefore they take it three times. When they take what is one and make it many, therefore one is the chief of many.
27.10.18	The Ukthya is the head of the sacrifice, the Ukthas are the limbs, the Sukra and Manthin are the eyes.
27.10.19	Because these two are most often invoked among the Soma-offerings, therefore the eye is common to all the limbs.
27.10.20	Because the Ukthya-vessel is most often invoked among Soma-offerings; therefore many follow one who goes to a meritorious place.
27.10.21	They indeed cut off the sacrifice when they establish the different Savanas.
27.10.22	The Ukthya is the self of the sacrifice.
27.10.23	When he takes up the Ukthya at each Savana, he thus makes the sacrifice continuous.
27.10.24	"For Indra thee, O thou of great power."
27.10.25	The sacrifice is indeed Indra's.
27.10.26	To him thee.
27.10.27	"For Vishnu thee."
27.10.28	Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
27.10.29	By means of the sacrifice of Vishnu, he extends the sacrifice.
27.10.30	Just as it is well-equipped on both sides, just as it is well protected on both sides, so is the Puroruk and the Graha.
27.10.31	Then this A-puroruk is taken.
27.10.32	The sacrifice is powerful, the sacrifice is extensive.
27.10.33	When he takes the Ukthya, it is equipped with that, well-protected.
27.10.34	The Ukthya is the head of the sacrifice, the Ukthas are the limbs.
27.10.35	The sacrifice is directed towards the east, with the Ukthas, the head is covered from behind.
27.10.36	When one offers the Ukthya, he covers the sacrifice directed towards the east from behind with the Ukthas and the head.
27.10.37	Therefore, the man is covered with skin, with the bones and marrow, from the head onwards.
27.10.38	Soma is indeed prosperity.
27.10.39	If the Adhvaryu desires, "May I be united with fame", he should offer between the Ahavaniya and Havirdhana fires.
27.10.40	This indeed is the world of the Adhvaryus.
27.10.41	The Adhvaryu himself places himself in his own world.
27.10.42	If he should desire, "May I place the sacrificer in his own world," he should place him between the Sadas and the sacrificial post.
27.10.43	This indeed is the world of the sacrificer.
27.10.44	The Adhvaryu places the sacrificer in the world of the Adhvaryu.
27.10.45	If he desires, "May I cause the members of the assembly to be placed in their own world," he may place them after having offered the Sadas.
27.10.46	This indeed, is the world of members of the assembly.
27.10.47	He bestows fame on his own members in this world.
27.10.48	The Self is the foremost of the sacrifice, the Uthyas are the limbs.
27.10.49	When the Uthyas follow the Aghamarana, he restores the limbs of the sacrifice to the Self.
27.10.50	Therefore the limbs are restored to the Self. Here is the text:
28.1.1	Life indeed is Dhruva.
28.1.2	The highest is taken.
28.1.3	Therefore, life is the best of the vital airs.
28.1.4	The ninth is taken.
28.1.5	For there are nine vital airs.
28.1.6	He places it alone on the northern Havirdhāna.
28.1.7	Therefore, the individual is the half-share of the vital airs, the vital air is downward.
28.1.8	Indeed, men are born following the fixed (vital air), other beings follow the other Grahas.
28.1.9	He places the Dhruva in the uncooked (rice), and the other Grahas in the cooked (rice).
28.1.10	Therefore man is supported by flesh, and cattle by bones.
28.1.11	The prince protects.
28.1.12	The prince is the lord of creatures.
28.1.13	Dhruva is life.
28.1.14	He protects life among creatures.
28.1.15	And he also protects the kingdom.
28.1.16	If one wishes to know whether one is free or not, then one should recite the verse: "I take you, O firm one, from the firm ground, the most firm of the firm, the most firm among the unfallen, from the most firm of those who are firm. I take you from the firm ground."
28.1.17	One who is free is firm, while one who is not free is not firm.
28.1.18-25	He bestows what has been obtained. He causes what has been obstructed to be obtained. They understand each other. If one were to do this, one would disturb the life of beings. One should remove grass from above with this mantra. With the same one causes what has been blocked to be obtained. It does not disturb the life of creatures. The altar is indeed the field of the gods.
28.1.26-31	The earth is as big as the sacrificial altar. He tells him about the human world by means of the divine world. One should take a full (portion) from one whom one desires to live for the whole life. He takes the full life from him. He lives for the whole life.
28.1.32	It makes his life short, if he takes it from the end.
28.1.33	If one desires, "May he go to a longer life," one should take it from the upper half.
28.1.34	He indeed goes to a longer life.
28.1.35	He takes life according to the form of the person.
28.1.36	One takes the Agnihotra from both sides.
28.1.37	Therefore the vital airs are Agnihotra from both.
28.1.38	The head of heaven, the desire of earth.
28.1.39	He bestows life among the gods and among men.
28.1.40	The sacrifice is equal to man.
28.1.41	Man is equal to life.
28.1.42	If he lies down from the morning Soma rite till the third pressing,
28.1.43	He makes the sacrifice equal to life.
28.1.44	These two are taken at the morning pressing, the Gayatri and the Dhruva.
28.1.45	They lie down from the third pressing, from the Jagati world.
28.1.46	Therefore the Gayatri is not exhausted at the later pressing.
28.1.47	This is the share.
28.1.48	The Gayatri is indeed the breath.
28.1.49	The Dhruva is life.
28.1.50	Whatever he lies down to sleep from the morning till the third pressing, that is his life.
28.1.51	Life is Dhruva.
28.1.52	Rudra is Agni.
28.1.53	One should not offer alone.
28.1.54	One should bestow life on the offspring.
28.1.55	They would be short-lived.
28.1.56	He pours into the Hotr's goblet.
28.1.57	The Hotr is Vaiśvadeva.
28.1.58	These creatures are of Visvedeva.
28.1.59	He places life in the creatures.
28.1.60	He makes it unstable when he lowers it.
28.1.61	The instability of this (oblation) does not accord with the creatures.
28.1.62	Let the divine classes of beings be firm, let men be firm. Let the divine be in heaven, the aerial in the atmosphere, and the terrestrial on earth. He makes the firm go down.
28.1.63	He makes the creatures firm in their respective abodes.
28.1.64	He should make it go down when the eulogy is invoked.
28.1.65	He makes it reach the praise by means of the praise itself.
28.1.66	If one were to offer the eulogy when it is called, or if one were to offer a cup when it is offered,
28.1.67	he should offer it in the middle Paridhananiya cup.
28.1.68	The Utkhamandana cups are the limbs of the sacrifice.
28.1.69	Dhruva is life.
28.1.70	Half of man's body are the limbs.
28.1.71	Half is life.
28.1.72	He places the life in the middle, enclosing the ends.
28.1.73	Why do they say this? The Brahmins say:
28.1.74	The waters, hastening, do not perish.
28.1.75	They do not flow away.
28.1.76	Waiting for this Soma-drink, they are firm.
28.1.77	For he indeed drives them away.
28.1.78	Sitting facing east, he pours down.
28.1.79	He makes it flow towards himself.
28.1.80	One should not let it flow away.
28.1.81	One should perform the Agniṣṭoma.
28.1.82	Dhruva is indeed life.
28.1.83	One would let life flow away.
28.1.84	The sacrifice is of this size, as much as the Agniṣṭomah.
28.1.85	When one performs the Agniṣṭom, one enters into the life.
28.1.86	One attains the entire life.
28.2.2	The gods desired to establish it.
28.2.3	They established it with the Rtugrahas.
28.2.4	When the Rtugraha is taken, it is for the establishment of the year, for the knowledge of the heavenly world.
28.2.5	Both take together the first (graha).
28.2.6	For both of them have come together to establish the year. Both take together the last.
28.2.7	Having thus made a year, both of them are released together.
28.2.8	The two vessels of the seasons are turned towards both sides.
28.2.9	The seasons are turned towards two sides.
28.2.10	We do not know which is the mouth of the seasons.
28.2.11	They should not approach each other.
28.2.12	If they approach each other, one season would be approaching another season.
28.2.13	What has passed.
28.2.14	Therefore they say, "Like horses, the seasons are sniffed at."
28.2.15	These twelve are grasped.
28.2.16	Twelve months are a year; for the establishment of the year.
28.2.17	The year is indeed the heavenly world.
28.2.18	These are its steps, the transits.
28.2.19	In that the seasonal cups are grasped, one ascends by them; for the attainment of the heavenly world.
28.2.20	There are six others, and six others.
28.2.21	The sun is the season.
28.2.22	Therefore he moves north for six months.
28.2.23	Six to the south, six to the season.
28.2.24	There are six seasons.
28.2.25	He stands in the seasons.
28.2.26	With four seasons.
28.2.27	Animals have four feet.
28.2.28	The animals are born in a year.
28.2.29	He begets animals on him from the year itself.
28.2.30	Twice with the season again.
28.2.31	The sacrificer has two feet.
28.2.32	He stands above the animals.
28.2.33	These are the drinkers of Soma, the kinsmen of Indra, who are the Soma-drinkers.
28.2.34	The seasonal cups.
28.2.35	"He drinks Soma in the proper season," so it is said.
28.2.36	"In the proper season."
28.2.37	They offer in the proper season.
28.2.38	They offer them in their own vessels.
28.2.39	Therefore, one born in the same family takes the oblation in his own vessel.
28.2.40	They take the oblation for him who knows thus.
28.2.41	They consume the oblation for the sake of non-exhaustion.
28.2.42	Therefore, the rain falls in due season.
28.2.43	Having thus created the year, the gods, having known heaven, placed this light of the sacrifice above.
28.2.44	When the Indra-Agni (graha) is taken up,
28.2.45	he places the light at the mouth of the sacrifice for the completion of the year and for the knowledge of the heavenly world.
28.2.46	Therefore the light moves higher and higher during the year.
28.2.47	He takes up Indra-Agni in the vessel of the seasons.
28.2.48	Indra-Agni are the nobility.
28.2.49	The seasons are the people.
28.2.50	He places the nobility above the people.
28.2.51	The gods who belong to the third pressing, having become all, desired the morning pressing.
28.2.52	Prajapati saw that they should be gratified in this Graha.
28.2.53	If the Vaishvadeva is taken at the morning pressing, he gratifies all the gods at the morning pressing.
28.2.54	They are gratified and pleased, and are released at the subsequent pressing.
28.2.55	One takes the Vaishvadev with the Sukra vessel.
28.2.56	The Sukra is indeed the sun.
28.2.57	These creatures are of Visvedeva.
28.2.58	Therefore, he is the protector of all creatures.
28.2.59	They think, "He is for me, he is for me."
28.3.1	At the midday pressing, Indra killed Vritra with the Maruts' strength.
28.3.2	The Marutvatīya hymn is performed.
28.3.3	The Marutavatīya hymn.
28.3.4	The Marutas are the Grahas.
28.3.5-11	He thus strengthens the sacrificer in every way. He slays Vritra in every way. The first Marutvatīya is the protection, the second is the removal. He removes with the third. He raises the thunderbolt with the first Marutvatlya. He carries it with the second. He spreads it with the third.
28.3.12	He should take it from one whom he hates.
28.3.13	The Maruts are strength.
28.3.14	He weakens him by means of strength.
28.3.15	Indra, about to slay Vritra, gave the Dakshina to the gods as a gift.
28.3.16	He slew Vritra with the Maruts.
28.3.17	Therefore, when the Maruts are mentioned, nothing should be given.
28.3.18	Then indeed Vritra was slain.
28.3.19	One becomes victorious.
28.3.20	One should not accept (it).
28.3.21	One who causes the animals to be driven away becomes without animals.
28.3.22	Indra, having slain Vritra, became Mahendra.
28.3.23	He surpassed the other gods.
28.3.24	He drew this cup of Mahendra, the redeeming one.
28.3.25	Therefore, the king, having won the battle, is purified from the defeated.
28.3.26	Then those gods said to him, "You have told us everything. Let it be so for us here too."
28.3.27	"How can it be so for you?"
28.3.28	"Let him sacrifice to this Viraj graha."
28.3.29	Viraj is indeed the divine vessel.
28.3.30	When one sacrifices to Viraj, one satisfies the deities with the divine vessel.
28.3.31	Therefore, when the king wins a battle, he gives gifts to the charioteers and the village chiefs.
28.3.32	The Gayatri has three feet, the Tristubh has fifteen, and the Jagati has twenty-one.
28.3.33	This is the Viraj.
28.3.34	The seventeen-fold is the abode.
28.3.35	When one performs the Viraj sacrifice, one makes it have an abode of seventeen.
28.3.36-41	He who hates him should offer to him with a Tristubh verse. The Tristubh is strength and energy. He severs him from his abode by means of strength and energy. He becomes without a abode and is defeated. The gods, having killed the Asuras, were seeking to avenge their enemies. They entered the sacrifice in the middle. They entered this very verse, namely Viraj.
28.3.42	The Viraja sacrifice is performed for the attainment of the desired objects of the deities.
28.3.43	The Adityas were going to the heavenly world when the Angiras brought them back to this world along with the sacrifice.
28.3.44	The Angiras said to the Adityas, "How many of you will we offer oblations?"
28.3.45	They said, "Thirty-three."
28.3.46	The Vasus are ten.
28.3.47	Indra is the eleventh.
28.3.48	The ten Rudras.
28.3.49	Indra is the eleventh.
28.3.50	The ten Adityas.
28.3.51	Indra the eleventh.
28.3.52	These are the thirty.
28.3.53	The deities are thirty.
28.3.54	The Vasat-call is two-syllabled.
28.3.55	Speech is one-syllabled
28.3.56	By that Indra.
28.3.57	His deities are ready for the offering.
28.3.58	His offering goes to the deity as it should.
28.3.59	They should choose him for the office of officiating priest, he who knows this.
28.3.60	For as many deities as there are, he conveys the oblation to them.
28.4.1	From the midday pressing the gods went to the heavenly world.
28.4.2	These are their steps and crossings, namely the Dakshina gifts.
28.4.3	When one gives Dakshina gifts, having built a bridge, one goes to the heavenly world.
28.4.4	As long as one gives life here, one has that much life in the other world.
28.4.5	Therefore, much should be given.
28.4.6	Therefore, they praise giving much here.
28.4.7	One builds a bridge to the superior.
28.4.8	Now, the gods do not know the best.
28.4.9	Therefore he shines forth now most brightly, and ascends to heaven as far as the highest heaven.
28.4.10	He offers with the Sūrya verses, for the completion of the heavenly world.
28.4.11	With two (verses).
28.4.12	The Sacrificer has two feet.
28.4.13	He makes him enter here.
28.4.14	When he offers with the Agniya verses in the Agnidhra chamber, he makes him enter the atmosphere.
28.4.15	Whatever he gives, he sends him to the world of heaven.
28.4.16	"Go to heaven, go to heaven," for the attainment of the world of heaven."
28.4.17	"I have approached you with form and with age, with age."
28.4.18	This is indeed the form of cattle, namely ghee and gold.
28.4.19	He approaches them with form and with form, with age and with age.
28.4.20	"May Tutha, the knower of all, divide you."
28.4.21	The truth is indeed the truth, the knower of all.
28.4.22	He divides them by means of truth and Brahman.
28.4.23	"This is your gift, O Agni, that has fallen from Soma."
28.4.24	Cattle belong to Agni.
28.4.25	They are given to Soma.
28.4.26	"He leads them along the path of Mitra."
28.4.27	He leads them along Mitra's path.
28.4.28	He leads them between the Agnidhra and the Sadas.
28.4.29	By this very path the gods went to the heavenly world.
28.4.30	He thus makes them go by that very path.
28.4.31	The Rakshas attacked the sacrifice of the gods from the right side.
28.4.32	They defeated it again from the Agnidhra.
28.4.33	When they take the Dakshina from the Agnidhara, it is for the victory of the sacrifice and the destruction of the Rakshas.
28.4.34	One offers in the Agnidhra with the Agniya verse.
28.4.35	The animals are Agni's.
28.4.36	For the redemption of animals.
28.4.37	One should offer with the second Varuna-rite if one is going to give a horse or a chariot or a slave.
28.4.38	Horses are Varuna's.
28.4.39	Trees are Varuna'
28.4.40	Agni is all the deities.
28.4.41	For the attainment of the deities.
28.4.42	He gives a gift.
28.4.43	This is the form of the metres.
28.4.44	By means of the form he wins the metres.
28.4.45	He gives gold.
28.4.46	He sends them to the heavenly world by means of the golden light.
28.4.47	"May they go to heaven, to the sweet, to the divine."
28.4.48	He sends them indeed to the heavenly world.
28.4.49	"He says, 'May I be the giver."
28.4.50	Therefore, they come to this world from the other world.
28.4.51	"He goes along the path of truth, with the moon as his gift."
28.4.52	He who is fit for sacrifice and is worthy is the path of truth.
28.4.53	He leads them along that very path.
28.4.54	"Today, I have recited the Brahmanic text, which is about the fathers and the fatherly."
28.4.55	He who knows the Veda and is a descendant of the sages is the fatherly and the fatherly.
28.4.56	This is what he means when he says, "This is the Veda."
28.4.57	For he is the one who is skilled in the art of extracting the essence.
28.4.58	When he gives it to a non-Brahmin, the trees flourish with that.
28.4.59	When he bestows it on Kanva and Kashyapa, the dew nourishes them.
28.4.60	When he grants it to a Brahmin who is not a student, the rays of light flourish with that.
28.4.61	The one he gives to the student of the Veda, the one to the student of Vedic lore, with that one he prospers in the other world and in this world it becomes for him again to enjoy.
28.4.62	Therefore, he should be chosen.
28.4.63	"He sees the sky, he sees the space." He looks at the assembly.
28.4.64	These Brahmanas are indeed Soma drinkers.
28.4.65	Their eyes are shining.
28.4.66	They give to those who are hostile.
28.4.67	May the lords not reject him.
28.4.68	He pays homage to them alone, for non-rejection.
28.4.69	He gives a golden coin.
28.4.70	Svabhanu, the demon, covered the sun with darkness.
28.4.71	Atri alone first found him.
28.4.72	When he gives a golden coin, it is for the attainment of the heavenly world.
28.4.73	If one does not find a Brāhmaṇa, one should give it to one who belongs to the Ārsheya family.
28.4.74	One prospers by that alone.
28.4.75	The Asuras took away the Dakṣiṇā from the gods.
28.4.76	They brought it back.
28.4.77	They said, "This is the one who stole."
28.4.78	They took away another one from them.
28.4.79	They brought that one back.
28.4.80	They said, "This is the manly one."
28.4.81	They brought another.
28.4.82	They approached her.
28.4.83	They said, "This one has been brought."
28.4.84	These indeed are the words of the Rishi, "Avadrapas stood on the shining (river) with ten thousand black (cows). Indra, with Sachi, placed the melting (cows) of the men in the river."
28.4.85	She became a female jackal and entered the Asuras.
28.4.86	She burnt them.
28.4.87	Therefore, the Dakshina is to be given away.
28.4.88	He should not accept it.
28.4.89	He should not move the cows.
28.4.90	It enters him as a wolf in the forest.
28.4.91	It burns him.
28.5.1	When he gives a cow, he obtains life.
28.5.2	When he offers clothes, he makes his life long.
28.5.3	When he makes a horse offering, he makes him shine like the sun.
28.5.4	Whatever he gives as a gift, be it a horse or a chariot, he thereby obtains the bodies.
28.5.5	Whatever he gives as a cow or a goat, he thereby obtains flesh.
28.5.6	Whatever he offers as cooked rice or gruel, he thereby obtains whatever is within himself.
28.5.7	Whatever he bestows as a gift, he thereby obtains himself.
28.5.8	For the self is the best gift.
28.5.9-17	What he gives to the Brahman, Brahman is connected with Brhaspati. By that he pleases Brhaspati. What he gives to Udgata, Udgata is connected with Prajapati. By that, he pleases Prajapati. What he gives for Hotr, Hotr is connected with all the gods. By that all his desired deities are pleased.
28.5.18-25	What he gives to the Adhvaryus. The Adhvaryus are the Asvins. He thus pleases them with the Asvins. What he gives to priests. The priests are the Hotrs. With that he pleases them. What he gives the members of the Soma-drinking assembly. He redeems him with that Soma which they drink.
28.5.26	The one he gives to a brahmin who is a student, a priest, and is devoted to him.
28.5.27	The knowledge that he knows becomes desired and pleased by him.
28.5.28	The one he gives to someone who is not a brahmin, not a student, and is not a priest, and who is devoted to him,
28.5.29	The knowledge that they know becomes desired and pleased.
28.5.30	The gift that one gives unwillingly, that the Brahman takes away from him.
28.5.31	The gift that one gives when asked, that one wins over his enemy.
28.5.32	The gift one gives outside the altar, that does not reach him.
28.5.33	The gifts that one gives to a relative who is not a priest, that one bestows on him.
28.5.34	Whatever he gives to the eldest, whatever he gives to the learned, by that very sense-organ he becomes, and whatever is desired and pleased by him, that becomes his.
28.6.1	The Adityas, having killed the Asuras, were seeking revenge. They entered the gods.
28.6.2	They entered the gods of two deities.
28.6.3	For these gods are most abundant with the gods.
28.6.4	Therefore the Soma is taken for the two deities.
28.6.5	Or the Adityas were born from the remnants.
28.6.6	Therefore this Soma is taken as the remnant.
28.6.7	Or the remnants are the shares of the Adityas.
28.6.8	Therefore this soma is taken as the remnants.
28.6.9	He takes it from the Pariṣṭit.
28.6.10	Rudra is Agni.
28.6.11	Cattle is Aditya.
28.6.12-17	For the protection of the cattle. The gods divided the sacrifices among Rudra. They said to him, "This is your share in the mother." They brought it down to the end of the Adityas, and that is what they hid from the sacrifice. When one takes the Adityas after the Parashrita, one hides Rudra from the sacrifice. The Adityas are the cattle.
28.6.18	Since Soma is taken in abundance, therefore cattle, when being used, do not perish.
28.6.19	If many are inside the altar, then one should take it.
28.6.20	He obtains that food.
28.6.21	If his enemy is inside the altar, one should take it then.
28.6.22	This indeed is the sacrificer's own world, the altar.
28.6.23	The animals are the sun.
28.6.24	One seizes the animals of one's enemy in his own world.
28.6.25	The verses are Brihatis.
28.6.26	The Brihatis are indeed animals.
28.6.27	The animals are the sun
28.6.28	He places animals in animals.
28.6.29	He first takes curd, then Soma.
28.6.30	Curd is indeed strength.
28.6.31	The animals belong to the sun.
28.6.32	He places the strength in the middle of the cattle.
28.6.33	It becomes cooked and coagulated.
28.6.34	Therefore, the raw (milk) is milked after the cooked (milk).
28.6.35	If one desires, 'Let it rain',
28.6.36	One should sprinkle with the formula, 'With that heavenly rain I sprinkle you.' One should sprinkle over curd.
28.6.37	Curd is cattle.
28.6.38	Cattle is Aditya.
28.6.39	When it rains, it rains on cattle.
28.6.40	He makes the rain fall on the animals.
28.6.41	He makes it with the Upāṃśusavana (cup).
28.6.42	Upāṃśusavana is the breath.
28.6.43	Animals are the sun.
28.6.44	He places the breath in the animals.
28.6.45	"This is your Soma-drink, O Vivasvat, the sun."
28.6.46	This indeed is the Upāṃsusavana.
28.6.47	He directly nourishes him with the Soma-drink.
28.6.48	If a little of the seed sown falls down, then it rains immediately.
28.6.49	Having taken it, he puts it down for the sake of holding the embryos and not for their destruction.
28.6.50	He throws it away in the tenth Stotra.
28.6.51	Therefore, in the tenth month, the embryos are born.
28.6.52	He offers elsewhere.
28.6.53	Rudra is Agni.
28.6.54	Cattle is Aditya.
28.6.55	For the protection of cattle.
28.6.56	If a brahmin is to perform a sacrifice, he should take cattle.
28.6.57	He becomes the protector of cattle being given away.
28.7.1	He takes Savitri with the Antaryama vessel.
28.7.2	Cattle are Antaryama.
28.7.3	Cattle are born with the impulse of Savitri.
28.7.4	He indeed generates them with the help of Savitr.
28.7.5	He offers to him who is not present.
28.7.6	Therefore, animals are born in the morning from those who are not present.
28.7.7	The gods were unable to lift up the third pressing.
28.7.8	Then Savitr was present at the morning pressing.
28.7.9	The gods said to him, "We shall lift this up with you."
28.7.10	He said, "No.
28.7.11	I am the chief.
28.7.12	I shall not go away."
28.7.13	They said, "The chief is here."
28.7.14	"We shall make an effort here." Savitr made an effort.
28.7.15	When Savitr is taken, it is for the effort of the third pressing.
28.7.16	With the verse, "O god Savitr, you are the chief," at the morning pressing.
28.7.17-21	Savitar has encompassed the sacrifice on all sides. He who knows this conquers his enemies on all sides. (The Hotr) takes up the Savitr cup at the third pressing from the Aggrayan cup. It is taken up in the morning, because the Aggrayan belongs to the Gayatri world. He takes it up at the third pressing in the Jagati world.
28.7.22	Therefore the Savitr is taken from the Aggrayaṇa.
28.7.23	Savitr is the Gāyatrī of the gods.
28.7.24	At the Savitr's pouring, one takes the Vaiśvadev.
28.7.25	This is a common cup for continuity.
28.7.26	These creatures are Vaiśvadevī.
28.7.27	The creatures are born with Savitr as their progenitor.
28.7.28	He generates them with Savitr as the progenitor.
28.7.29	You are Suśarman, well-established.
28.7.30	He takes Soma for Soma.
28.7.31	And he makes Suśarman the upper one for the lower one.
28.7.32	And he (makes) Supratiṣṭhāna the lower one for the upper one.
28.7.33	Salutations to Brihad-Uksa.
28.7.34	Brihad is the salutation of the gods, the salutation of ancestors.
28.7.35	The ancestors are the partakers of praise, the fathers are the partakers.
28.7.36	Where he recites the eulogy to them, there he takes the cup for them.
28.8.1	The Patnivata is indeed the begetting of offspring.
28.8.2	Whatever is done in the sacrifice as Patnivata, it is indeed the begetter of offspring.
28.8.3	He takes it in the Upamsu vessel.
28.8.4	Upamsu is indeed the breath.
28.8.5	From the breath offspring are born. For begetting.
28.8.6	They go forth with the Upāṃśu.
28.8.7	They rise with the Upāmsupātra.
28.8.8	Upāṃśu is the breath.
28.8.9	They go forth with the breath.
28.8.10	With the breath they rise.
28.8.11	"The son of Brihaspati, that one."
28.8.12	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman.
28.8.13	Brahman's offspring are born.
28.8.14	He generates them with Brahman.
28.8.15	"Indra."
28.8.16	He places the semen itself.
28.8.17	"He says, "Indriya-avat."
28.8.18	Indriya is indeed the offspring, the drinking of Soma.
28.8.19	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, "Agni and Patni-van."
28.8.20	He makes a couple.
28.8.21	"He drinks Soma with Tvashtra."
28.8.22	Tvashtra is the creator of forms."
28.8.23	He creates forms for him.
28.8.24	This indeed is the cup that did not stand up for the wives.
28.8.25	The gods, having made him the sacrificial butter, struck him down.
28.8.26	When one offers the Pātnīvata (cup), it is for covering.
28.8.27	One offers with the Sampāta (cup), for continuity.
28.8.28	One offers above,
28.8.29	Therefore a woman is fickle and desirous.
28.8.30	He offers the Soma that has been pressed, not the others that have not been pressed.
28.8.31	Therefore a woman has no power, a man has no power.
28.8.32	The Hotri does not offer for him.
28.8.33	For he is behind.
28.8.34	One should withdraw the breaths from behind.
28.8.35	The Agnid performs the offering.
28.8.36	For he stands in front.
28.8.37	One does not offer the breaths after the one in front.
28.8.38	If one were to offer after, one would obstruct the breaths with fire and would die.
28.8.39	One consumes Soma that has been spread out.
28.8.40	Therefore the Agnid is a eunuch or one who is in the process of becoming a eunuch.
28.8.41	The Patnīvat is for procreation.
28.8.42	Therefore, one who has many cattle and is prosperous.
28.8.43	He approaches the Neshtar with the vessel.
28.8.44	He makes the wives drink Soma.
28.8.45	One should not sit on the lap.
28.8.46	If one sits on the lap, one becomes a eunuch.
28.8.47	He moves between the Neshtar and the altar.
28.8.48	The Neshtar is a woman.
28.8.49	The altar is a man.
28.8.50	He places the semen in the pair.
28.9.1	Indra indeed killed Vritra.
28.9.2	His head oozed out.
28.9.3	It became the Drona Kalasha.
28.9.4	From that, the Soma that flowed down became the Hariyajana.
28.9.5	Indra, having killed Vritra, sprinkled Soma from the heart of his skin.
28.9.6	It became Hariyajana.
28.9.7	He thought, "If I were to offer this unmixed, without a second, then the Asuras would follow.
28.9.8	If I were not to offer, then they would follow."
28.9.9	He remained, the Soma was ready.
28.9.10	The enclosing sticks were thrown down.
28.9.11	Then the Hotr stood up.
28.9.12	Agni said to him, "You will not offer this uncooked oblation to me without a second."
28.9.13	He poured the oblations into it.
28.9.14	He offered it cooked with a second.
28.9.15	When he pours the oblations, it is for cooking and for having a second.
28.9.16	These are the cattle that were in Vritra.
28.9.17	He obtains the cattle that yield what is desired.
28.9.18	He does it according to his wish.
28.9.19	The Rg and the Sāman are the two horses of Indra.
28.9.20	Their share is the Hāriyojana.
28.9.21	The Ādhānas are the Paridhīs.
28.9.22	When the Paridhīs are struck, he offers the Hāri-yojana. He thus provides fodder for them without Ādhānas.
28.9.23	Prajapati is the Āgrayaṇa.
28.9.24	This Soma is in excess of the Āgrayana.
28.9.25	What is in excess of a sacrifice, that is in excess of Prajapati.
28.9.26	When he offers this Soma which is in excess, therefore this Prajapati is in excess.
28.9.27	He indeed flows over the offspring.
28.9.28	The Unnetr offers with the Dronakalaśa and the Hāriyojana.
28.9.29	The Dronakalaśa is an extra vessel.
28.9.30	The Unneta is an extra officiant.
28.9.31	The Dhāriyujaṇa is an extra Soma.
28.9.32	One obtains the extra by means of the extra.
28.9.33	They desire to invite the Unneta.
28.9.34	It is for the sake of securing the Soma that is there.
28.9.35	Those animals which were in Vritra are these very ones.
28.9.36	If one were to pierce it, then those who are his enemies would enjoy the few animals that would stand near him.
28.9.37	For he would injure.
28.9.38	If one does not pierce it, then many animals would enjoy those who are his friends and would stand near him,
28.9.39	for he does not injure.
28.9.40	One should take it as if it were joined.
28.9.41	He does both.
28.9.42	Many cattle, without any harm, eat and stand near him.
28.9.43	He should pour out like milk.
28.9.44	Whatever Soma-drink there is, for its binding.
28.9.45	He pours it on the northern altar.
28.9.46	The northern altar is cattle.
28.9.47	The northern yoke is cattle.
28.9.48	He places cattle in cattle.
28.10.1	The vessels are employed for the support of these two worlds.
28.10.2	Other vessels are not employed.
28.10.3	Those which are employed support this world, those which are not employed support the other world.
28.10.4	For the other world is far away.
28.10.5	The Upāṁśu vessel is employed without being mentioned.
28.10.6	The goats are born after the animals.
28.10.7	He takes it three times.
28.10.8	Therefore she gives birth to three.
28.10.9	Or two.
28.10.10	When the Upāṁśu vessel is used, it is by that that she establishes the animals as goats.
28.10.11	The Antaryāma vessel is used.
28.10.12	The animals are born after that.
28.10.13	When the Antaryāmavessel is used, it establishes the animals as sheep.
28.10.14	They are used in the Rtu-vessel.
28.10.15	Horses are born after the animals.
28.10.16	Therefore, the hair of the horse is below like that of them.
28.10.17	When they are used in the RtU-vessel, he thereby establishes the animals in the horses.
28.10.18	The Ukthya vessel is used.
28.10.19	The animals are born after the wild animals.
28.10.20-25	Therefore, they kill those who have been captured and brought to the village. When the Ukthya vessel is used, it supports animals from the forest. The Sukra vessel is used. The offspring of the Atri lineage are born from it. The Manthi vessel is used. The offspring of the original (Atri) lineage are born from that.
28.10.26	When these are employed, he thus supports both the seasonal and the original creatures.
28.10.27	The Ritu-vessel is employed before the Sukra-vessel.
28.10.28	The Sukra is indeed the sun.
28.10.29	The rays are the seasons.
28.10.30	Therefore these are employed before.
28.10.31	For these are before.
28.10.32	The Aditya-vessel is employed after this.
28.10.33	The cows alone are born after the cattle.
28.10.34	When the vessel of the sun is employed, it supports the cattle by that.
28.10.35	The vessel of Aggrayaṇa is employed.
28.10.36	All the creatures are born after that.
28.10.37	When the Aggrayaṇa vessel is employed, it sustains all the creatures by that.
28.10.38	A vessel of a Drona is employed.
28.10.39	Prajapati is the Dronakalaśa.
28.10.40	When the Dronakalaša is used, then this Prajapati knows the creatures.
28.10.41	Therefore, there is this loss.
28.10.42	So many Grahas are taken in the morning.
28.10.43	They should be done with Stotras, Ukthas, Nidānas and Āyatanas.
28.10.44	Having taken these nine, they chant the Bahispavamāna.
28.10.45	By that they are endowed with the Stotra.
28.10.46	When he takes the Asvin again,
28.10.47	he is endowed with the Stoma.
28.10.48	When the Hotṛ recites the Upaṃśu and Antaryāma offerings, by that they are endowed.
28.10.49	When the Indra-Vayu offering, by that the Indra-Vāyu is endowed.
28.10.50	By that which is Maitrāvaruṇa, the Maitrāvaruṇa is the Ukhāvan.
28.10.51	By that which is Āśvin, the Āśvin is the Ukhāvān.
28.10.52	By that Nishkevalya, the Sukramani is the Ukhävān.
28.10.53	By the Vaishvadev, the Agrāyan is the Ukhān.
28.10.54	By Agni-Marut, the Dhruva is the Ukhän.
28.10.55	The Utkhyas are those hymns which are sung by the Utkhyasingers. By them one becomes Utkhya and Utkhyavān.
28.10.56	Thus many Grahas are taken in the morning.
28.10.57	He makes them with the Stotra, Utkha, Nidāna, and Āyatanas.
28.10.58	One becomes Nidānavān and Āyatanavān, who knows thus.
29.1.1	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a battle.
29.1.2	Those gods defeated the groups of gods one by one.
29.1.3	They knew, "We are without a home, that is why we are defeated."
29.1.4	They made these (offerings) in front (of them).
29.1.5	They did not take them as their home.
29.1.6	They saw these oblations.
29.1.7	They poured them down after the Soma-pressing.
29.1.8	With them they strengthened the front.
29.1.9	The Savanas indeed were the first to perform (the sacrifice).
29.1.10	Because they established themselves first, therefore the Purorasa-s are called Purorasa- s.
29.1.11	Because he offers the Purorasa -s after the Savanas, (it is) for the stability and victory of the Savanas.
29.1.12	Therefore one should eat the Purorasa after the Savanas for the stability of the Soma-drink.
29.1.13	If one were to anoint with ghee, one should eat from there.
29.1.14	The gods killed Vritra with the thunderbolt and ghee.
29.1.15	Soma was Vritra.
29.1.16	For the killing of Soma-drinkers.
29.1.17	They say, "One should not offer anything other than ghee and Aghara."
29.1.18	Everything that is offered as oblation is offered.
29.1.19	If it is not offered, one should not eat it.
29.1.20	The long-tongued one stole the sacrifice of the gods.
29.1.21	He stole the morning pressing.
29.1.22	Because it became Payasyā, therefore it is Amikṣā.
29.1.23	Because Payasyā is at the morning pressing, for the prosperity of the morning pressing. The morning pressing is at the morning offering.
29.1.24	The morning pressing is at Mitra-Varuna.
29.1.25	It does not reach the later pressings.
29.1.26	Mitra-Varuna are the out-breath and in-breath.
29.1.27	The Prāṇa and Apāna winds are indeed expelled through the mouth.
29.1.28	Therefore, the Prāṇa and the Apāna winds are through the mouth.  
29.1.29	The Paṅkti is not established in the sacrifice by means of praise or by means of a weapon.
29.1.30	These are the five oblations.
29.1.31	He thus establishes the Paṅkti in the sacrifice.
29.1.32	The sacrifice is the Paṅkti of oblations, the Paṅkti is the Nārāśaṃsa, the Paṅktis are the Paṅktyas.
29.1.33	These are the five oblations.
29.1.34	By that, the oblation-row.
29.1.35	Two Nārāśaṃsa oblations at the morning pressing.
29.1.36	Two Nāśaṃsā oblations at the midday pressing.
29.1.37	One Nārāśamsa oblation at the third pressing.
29.1.38	By that the Nārāśṃsa row.
29.1.39	The animal sacrifice to Agni-Soma, the three pressings and the Vasanū-bandhyā oblations.
29.1.40	The Paṅkti oblation.
29.1.41	He who knows thus the forms of sacrifice, conquers.
29.1.42	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a contest.
29.1.43	The gods lost their glory to the Asuras.
29.1.44	They went to the Asuras,
29.1.45	and the Asuras killed many hundreds of the gods.
29.1.46	These are the metres which are not conducive to sacrifice.
29.1.47	The gods were afraid, thinking, "Thus the Asuras will destroy us all."
29.1.48	They invited them.
29.1.49	They said, "We choose a boon."
29.1.50	They chose the Parivap-Purorasa.
29.1.51	It became their share.
29.1.52	The Rk and Sama went away from them.
29.1.53	Cattle is speech.
29.1.54	Breath and out-breath are power.
29.1.55	He thought, "These indeed were mine."
29.1.56	He attained union with them.
29.1.57	"Indra ate the food of Hariva."
29.1.58	The Rk and the Sama are Indra's horses.
29.1.59	He attained union only with the Rk and the Sāman.
29.1.60	"Indulging in Pūṣan, the food."
29.1.61	Pūṣan is indeed the animals.
29.1.62	He attained only union with the animals.
29.1.63	Sarasvati, Bharti, Parivap.
29.1.64	Sarasvati is speech.
29.1.65	She attained union with speech.
29.1.66	Indra's cake.
29.1.67	Indra is the senses.
29.1.68	He attained union with the senses.
29.1.69	The milk of Mitra and Varuna.
29.1.70	Mitra and Varuna are the vital airs.
29.1.71	He attained unity with the vital airs. 
29.1.72	By the greatness of these alone, one attains union with them.
29.1.73	One attains the full span of life, becomes endowed with cattle, and does not encounter any difficulties in performing sacrifices, if one knows this.
29.2.1	Indeed, the Yajus is performed as a nest for the sacrifice.
29.2.2	For it is performed loudly with the Rk and the Saman.
29.2.3	The verses are strong and firm, for firmness and stability.
29.2.4	The Rk indeed leads, the Yajus directs, the Graha carries.
29.2.5	The Stotra is taken up with the Rk, the Sastra with the Yajus.
29.2.6	Therefore these two are joined together.
29.2.7	For the Stotra and the Sastra are joined together.
29.2.8	The sacrifice is now far away, the deities are far away at the third pressing from the sacrificer.
29.2.9	He offers the Soma of Agni in front, that of Soma on top, and that of Vishnu on top.
29.2.10	Agni is all the deities.
29.2.11	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
29.2.12	He wins the deities and the sacrifice.
29.2.13	They indeed kill Soma when they press it.
29.2.14	This is his (Agni's) propitiation, that he is gentle.
29.2.15	He offers on the southern half of the fire.
29.2.16	For the southern direction belongs to the Pitrs.
29.2.17	He offers once.
29.2.18	For the Pitrs have only one offering.
29.2.19	When he offers a second time with the ladle, then it becomes only one offering. He offers to the Udgātṛs.
29.2.20	They take it.
29.2.21	The Sama Veda is dedicated to Soma. For the sake of strength and for the sake of the body.
29.2.22	They debate whether to eat or not to eat.
29.2.23	If one eats, one becomes a glutton.
29.2.24	If one does not eat, one becomes without oblations.
29.2.25	One should smell it.
29.2.26	One does both.
29.2.27	One who is able to eat food but does not eat, he should eat.
29.2.28	The Fathers are the highest food.
29.2.29	He wins the lower food by the higher food.
29.2.30	The gods made this medicine for the sacrifice.
29.2.31	This is the healing of Soma.
29.2.32	Therefore it should be drunk by one who is not sick.
29.2.33	The Fathers are singing.
29.2.34	The Fathers, the images of Soma, are singing.
29.2.35	May we enjoy the life that is the boon of the gods.
29.2.36	Indra-drunk, discerning.
29.2.37	We have enjoyed the divine life that is ours.
29.2.38	Thou art the giver of splendour, thou touchest the heart, thou touchest sacrifice. Give me splendour.
29.2.39	Whatever my mind has gone to Yama, or whatever has not come to me,
29.2.40	With the king Soma, we have that in ourselves.
29.2.41	One should look at the moon.
29.2.42	Or whatever he does here, that goes to the Pitrs of the Self whose Self is measured.
29.2.43	Whatever he looks at with a friendly eye, that he gives to himself.
29.2.44	One should look around.
29.2.45	Whatever one looks around, one looks around oneself.
29.2.46	He who, knowing this, looks at a friendly eye, he indeed sees all forms in the other world.
29.2.47	The Upasads are indeed strength.
29.2.48	The third pressing is without power.
29.2.49	They are performed outside the sacrifice.
29.2.50	When they perform the third pressing with the Soma rite, they bestow power on the third pressing.
29.2.51	These deities are worshipped at the Upasads.
29.2.52	He performs the Soma rite in front of the Agniya rite.
29.2.53	"So that they may not approach the sacrifice in a defeated condition."
29.2.54	The Vaisnavya (oblation) is offered after the Agniṣṭoma.
29.2.55	"He strews on both sides, saying, "Let us not go to the Somiya (oblation)."
29.2.56	He offers ghee with the Agrayana (oblation), the Somiya with the Somiya (offering), and the Vaisnavya after the ghee.
29.2.57	He arranges the deities in the proper order.
29.3.1	The Prāṇas are the Sthiti-Yajus.
29.3.2	These are the nine formulas.
29.3.3	They praise the Bahispavamāna with nine verses.
29.3.4	There are nine vital airs.
29.3.5	They proceed with the vital airs.
29.3.6	With the vital airs they rise.
29.3.7	He offers continuously for the continuity of the vital airs. There is no interruption.
29.3.8	If one desires, "Let him perish," one should offer each of the nine oblations taken nine times with the Ayus-verse.
29.3.9	The Prāṇas are the Sthiti-Yajus.
29.3.10	He thus places him within the Prāṇas.
29.3.11	He shoots the arrow.
29.3.12	Tvaṣṭra, in his various forms, saw the sacrifice in its incomplete and complete forms.
29.3.13	These are the six Rg-Yajus-Sāman-forms.
29.3.14	Whatever is incomplete in it, he completes it with them.
29.3.15	Three Yajus-forms.
29.3.16	It is indeed complete.
29.3.17	There are six Rg verses.
29.3.18	There are six seasons.
29.3.19	One finds support in the seasons.
29.3.20	There are three Yajus verses.
29.3.21	There these three worlds.
29.3.22	One prospers in these worlds.
29.3.23	Whatever exceeds the sacrifice, Varuna takes that.
29.3.24	This is what exceeds the sacrifice, namely, the flour of roasted barley.
29.3.25	Whatever is made of Udumbara wood, whatever is used for pressing, with that they perform the Avabhrtha rite in the water.
29.3.26	Water is Varuna.
29.3.27	For the purpose of being free from Varuna.
29.3.28	They should not go to the flowing waters.
29.3.29	The Rgisa grass is indeed cattle.
29.3.30	They would be rubbing off his cattle.
29.3.31	He would become without cattle.
29.3.32	They should go to the flowing water.
29.3.33	If they were to go towards the north, Varuna would seize the offspring.
29.3.34	There is no Dakṣiṇā.
29.3.35	If there were Dakṣiṇās, the offspring would be scattered among the fathers.
29.3.36	They go towards the north and towards the east.
29.3.37	For the sacrifice goes towards the east, being released from Varuna's noose.
29.3.38	They go in the standing (places).
29.3.39	Varuna is indeed standing in the standing (things).
29.3.40	Varuna himself releases Varuna.
29.3.41	For indeed, King Varuna has made a great (act of) release.
29.3.42	"O king, your hundred physicians, your thousand," as in the Yajus.
29.3.43	"He pours the libation, saying, 'I have entered the army of Agni,' for kindling and for blazing.
29.3.44	If he sees grass or wood, he should pour the libation back."
29.3.45	He offers to Agni alone, for prosperity.
29.3.46	He offers the Prajās at the Apabarāhisākāraṇa.
29.3.47	The Barhīs are the offspring.
29.3.48	He releases the offspring from death.
29.3.49	He offers two Ajyabhagāras.
29.3.50	The Ajyabhagārāras are the Prāṇāpānās.
29.3.51	He releases from Varuna's noose the Prāṇās and Apānās of the offspring.
29.3.52	Now this is the Varuna rite.
29.3.53	For being free from Varuna.
29.3.54	It is one-headed.
29.3.55	One should not offer a man with skulls.
29.3.56	One obtains him only by one (means).
29.3.57	One pours out (the Soma) for Agni and Varuna.
29.3.58	One releases him from both the noose of Agni and Varuna on both sides.
29.3.59	This entire sacrifice
29.3.60	Of it, much is done.
29.3.61	Much is not done.
29.3.62	If he were to establish the sacrifice, he would be bound by Varuna.
29.3.63	If he does not establish the sacrifice, then he is released from the noose of Varuna.
29.3.64	"Your heart is in the ocean, in the waters."
29.3.65	The sacrifice has the ocean as its source.
29.3.66	He sends it to its own source.
29.3.67	"He says, 'For thee, O sacrifice, for thee, O lord of sacrifice,' he makes an offering.
29.3.68	"Avabhrtha, Nicukune" - thus he frees him from both, from the deed of the gods and from the deed of men.
29.3.69	"The divine waters, this is your embryo."
29.3.70	This is the embryo of the waters.
29.3.71	He sends him to his own womb.
29.3.72	"The noose of Varuna is released, the noose of Varun is released" - thus they release the noose of varuna.
29.3.73	"The god Soma, washed in the waters," he sips the drop.
29.3.74	This is for the release of whatever Soma has been drunk there.
29.3.75	If he were to sip, Varuna would seize him. He should say, "Let me be released."
29.3.76	He does both.
29.3.77	"Varuna's noose is turned back. Obeisance to Varuna's nouse," he turns back Varuna's snare.
29.3.78	"May they come forth, bestowing progeny, life, and lustre," he says, thus he prays for blessings.
29.3.79	"Thou art the kindler, we kindle," thus they pray to Varuna for kindling.
29.3.80	"Thou are the kindler, I kindle," thus he prays for blessing.
29.3.81	"Thou hast lustre, bestow lustre on me," thus he bestows lustre on himself.
29.3.82	I have wandered today with the waters, I have united with the earth through its juice, as per the Yajus.
29.4.1	The head of the sacrifice was cut off.
29.4.2	From that, the juice that flowed became the Vasha.
29.4.3	When the Anubandhya Vasha is performed, it is for the sake of the juice of the sacrifice.
29.4.4	Mitra takes the well-performed part of the sacrifice, Varuna takes the ill-performed part.
29.4.5-9	When it is the Maitrāvaruṇa's (duty), it is the Vashānūbandhyā. He gives the sacrifice to the sacrificer, having released it from both Mitra and Varuna. Just as a furrow is broken by a plough, so the sacrifice is broken by the Rk and Sama. Just as one breaks the ground by a plough, just so does one break the sacrifice by the Rk, Sama and Yajus. Just as the ground is broken by a furrow, just so is the sacrifice broken by the Rg, Sama and Yajur. Just as when one has broken the ground, one sows the seed, just so does the sacrifice, having been broken, is sown by the Rg and Sama. When it is the Vashambandhya (duty),
29.4.10	The sacrifice is connected with peace.
29.4.11	What first flowed, that Brihaspati took; what second, that Mitra-Varuna; what third, that the All-gods.
29.4.12	If there are three Anubandhya (verses), one should recite the Maitravaruni first, then the Vaishvadevi, then the Bharhaspatya, for the completeness of the sacrifice, for the prosperity of the sacrifice.
29.4.13	Here indeed is the essence of the sacrifice.
29.4.14	Those deities and Brahman are exhausted for him who performs a Soma sacrifice.
29.4.15	Because these (verses) are addressed to the All-gods and to Brhaspati, for the exhaustion of the deities and Brahman.
29.4.16	The verse addressed to the Allgods comes in the middle.
29.4.17	These creatures are addressed to the all-gods.
29.4.18	He places the seed in the creatures.
29.4.19	He offers silently.
29.4.20	For semen is not uttered.
29.4.21	The last one is dedicated to Brhaspati.
29.4.22	Brhaspati is indeed Brahman.
29.4.23	Having reached the end, he stands firm in Brahmanic splendour.
29.4.24	Just as a bull or a horse released would go away, so do the deities and the sacrifice go away from Soma.
29.4.25	He offers the oblation to Agni in five potsherds at the end of the sacrifice.
29.4.26	Agni is all the deities.
29.4.27	The sacrifice is fivefold.
29.4.28	He wins the deities and the sacrifice.
29.4.29	The Agni is the Gayatri metre.
29.4.30	He makes it deficient in the metre when he makes it in five potsherads.
29.4.31	It should be made in eight potsherds.
29.4.32	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
29.4.33	Agni is Gāyatrī, the metres are Gāyatrī.
29.4.34	He makes him prosper with his own metre.
29.4.35	The Yajya and Anuvākyā are in the Pāṅkti metre.
29.4.36	The sacrifice is in the Pāṃkti metre.
29.4.37	He goes to the sacrifices with that.
29.5.1	Taken with the Upayāma, to thee, O Prajapati, to thee, the luminous, I take the luminous one, to Daksha, to the one who increases Daksha, to Agnijihvas, to the ones who are swift and strong, to the ones whose nature is Parjanya, to the ones led by Indra, to the ones ruled by Varuna, to thee, to the earth, to thee,to the atmosphere, to thee, for the existent, to thee,for the non-existent, to thee, for the beings, to thee, who will be, to thee, from whom the unfailing progeny is born, to him, to thee, Prajapati, the all-pervading, I offer, svāhā.
29.5.2	Soma desires the waters, the waters desire Soma.
29.5.3	Just as cows, knowing each other, kill each other in a herd, so these two, knowing each other and united, destroy each other's strength and power.
29.5.4	Both of these are Prajapati's: Soma and water.
29.5.5	This is the essence of water: curd.
29.5.6	When two sons fight, the father makes peace between them. The father makes peace between his own sons by means of their own share.
29.5.7	He who performs this sacrifice with prosperity, he performs the sacrifice.
29.5.8	All the Savanas should be performed with curds, and should be endowed with animals and energy.
29.5.9	When they perform the Payasyā at the morning Savana, it becomes endowed with animals and energetic.
29.5.10	Whatever is done with the Dadhigraha at midday, that makes it endowed with cattle and strength.
29.5.11	Whatever is done with the Ashira at the third pressing, that makes it cattle-endowed and strong.
29.5.12	All his pressings become cattle-endowed, strong, for him who knows thus.
29.6.1	The gods, having conquered the Asuras in the sacrifice, went to the Grahas, taking them in their hands.
29.6.2	He thought, "He who will take it first will be the owner of it."
29.6.3	He saw this ray.
29.6.4	He took it while it was going away.
29.6.5	It went to the end of prosperity.
29.6.6	One who desires to prosper should take it.
29.6.7	It goes away only while one is breathing in, not while one is breathing out.
29.6.8	It goes to the end of only prosperity.
29.6.9	If one is afflicted by a disease, or if one is afflicted by an illness, or if one loses all one's wealth,
29.6.10	if one desires that the sacrificer should be equal to him, one should not breathe in or out.
29.6.11	One becomes equal.
29.6.12	The vessel has four corners.
29.6.13	There are four directions.
29.6.14	One prospers in all directions.
29.6.15	One touches with gold.
29.6.16	Gold is nectar.
29.6.17	He thus unites him with nectar.
29.6.18	He takes it from the first-poured out (Soma).
29.6.19	One should not seek Prajapati through the pressing.
29.6.20	He obtains him by one means only.
29.6.21	He does not recite the Rk.
29.6.22	He does no Yajus.
29.6.23	One should not try to obtain Prajapati through speech.
29.6.24	He obtains it only through the mind.
29.6.25	He who knows the abode of the Anṣu becomes the possessor of the abode.
29.6.26	Taking the Anṣu of Vāmadevya, one should meditate on Vāmadevyā with the mind.
29.6.27	This is indeed the abode of the Anshu.
29.6.28	One becomes the possessor of an abode who knows this.
29.6.29	He spreads out gold.
29.6.30	Gold is indeed life.
29.6.31	He spreads himself over life.
29.6.32	He sprinkles with water.
29.6.33	Water is nectar.
29.6.34	He pacifies him with nectar alone.
29.7.1	Now these are the Atigrahya (grahas).
29.7.2	Whatever supreme strength and power is unconfined, for the confinement of that.
29.7.3	If it is dedicated to Agni,
29.7.4	Agni is brilliance.
29.7.5	He places brilliance in front of him by that.
29.7.6	If (dedicated) to Indra,
29.7.7	Indra is power.
29.7.8	By that he places the sense-organ in the middle.
29.7.9	If it is solar,
29.7.10	the sun is indeed Brahman-splendour.
29.7.11	By that he places Brahman-splendout above.
29.7.12	Fire is indeed splendour,
29.7.13	Indra is sense-organ,
29.7.14	the sun indeed is Brahman-splendou.
29.7.15	He thus takes the sense-organ on both sides of himself, with splendour and Brahman-splendur.
29.7.16	The Atigrahya cups are the support of the sacrifice.
29.7.17	The Prsthya (cups) are the two wheels.
29.7.18	If these (cups) were not taken, the heavier Prsthya cups would have pushed the sacrifice forward.
29.7.19	When these (cups) are taken,
29.7.20	the sacrifice is supported in front and the Prsthya is performed for the sake of stability.
29.7.21	One should take them at the morning pressing.
29.7.22	This is the most vigorous of the pressing-rounds.
29.7.23	He takes them by means of vigour.
29.7.24	The gods were all alike.
29.7.25	They did not go their separate ways.
29.7.26	Then they saw these Grahas: Agni the Agniya, Indra the Indraya, Surya the Sūrya.
29.7.27	Then they went their separate ways, and became the best of the gods.
29.7.28	He who takes these, goes to the highest place among his equals.
29.7.29	Prajapati indeed assigned the shares to the gods.
29.7.30	He thought that the sacrifice itself was his own share.
29.7.31	Of him, the three beloved forms were there, he removed them.
29.7.32	He indeed removed these Grahas.
29.7.33	Whoever desires to perform a sacrifice should take these Grahas.
29.7.34	He gathers him completely, with all his strength, with all his origin, with all his body, for prosperity.
29.7.35	These (Grahas) were formerly of Vritra.
29.7.36	Indra, having killed Vritra, found this Agniya.
29.7.37	He gave it to Agni, saying, "May he hold this for me."
29.7.38	He found the solar (graha).
29.7.39	He gave it to Surya, saying, "May he hold this."
29.7.40	Having found the lunar (graha), he again asked for the other two.
29.7.41	They did not give them back to him.
29.7.42	They went through these worlds: Agni this one, Indra the intermediate one, Surya the other one.
29.7.43	By means of these Grahas they succeeded in these worlds.
29.7.44	By these he passes on to the lordship of these worlds.
29.7.45	He prospers in all these worlds and passes on to the dominion of these worlds, for whom these are taken up.
29.7.46	What is the splendour of Viraj, that is the Agniya.
29.7.47	What is of Shakvari, that is the Indra.
29.7.48	What is that of Revati, that is the Surya.
29.7.49	Where these Sāmans are, one should take them for the brilliance of the Sāmans.
29.7.50	Now these offerings and oblations.
29.7.51	By these, Bāmbhaviśva-vasa attained these worlds, both below and above.
29.7.52	For him who takes these, these worlds, both above and below, shine.
29.7.53	By the power of these (gods) Agni shines above,
29.7.54	the Sun shines below,
29.7.55	the Wind blows across.
29.7.56	The good-knowing one knows thus: 'This is the world.'
29.7.57	But the bad-knowing one knows you from afar.
29.7.58	He who knows this world from afar, he who knows this world, he who knows these (worlds), he knows this world.
29.8.1	The Agniya, the Saumya and the Barhaspatya are offered together.
29.8.2	The Agniya is offered first.
29.8.3	Agni is brilliance.
29.8.4	He thus places brilliance in front of him.
29.8.5	The Saumya is offered next.
29.8.6	Soma is power.
29.8.7	He thus puts power in the middle.
29.8.8	The Barhaspatya is offered last.
29.8.9	Brihaspati is Brahman.
29.8.10	He thus bestows upon him the lustre of Brahman.
29.8.11	Fire is brilliance,
29.8.12	Soma is power,
29.8.13	Brihaspati is Brahman.
29.8.14	He thus takes power and Brahman within himself from both sides.
29.8.15	The demons attacked the sacrifice of the gods from the south.
29.8.16	The deities who are stronger are offered to on the right side, for the sake of removing Rakshas.
29.8.17	What is done in the Ekadashini? The Brahmavadins say:
29.8.18	Because the Kshatra is dependent on the Brahmana.
29.8.19	The deities who are stronger, are offered to on their right side, and the weaker ones, on their left side.
29.8.20	Therefore, one should perform the Vits ceremony for the Kshatriya class.
29.8.21	One should perform the Udvana ceremony to the south.
29.8.22	It is the form of the divine sacrifice.
29.8.23	For the removal of Rakshasas.
29.8.24	Therefore, the depth of the Tirtthas should be to the south. 
29.8.25	One should make the three Agni-related ones equal.
29.8.26	The animals stand near the fire for the presence of animals.
29.8.27	The Self is the nearest to Agni.
29.8.28	His brothers are the other two.
29.8.29	One should make them the more distant.
29.8.30	One makes the brother the lower one.
29.8.31	The two that are the farthest are equal to the nearest one.
29.8.32	For they are his own.
29.8.33	One should measure thus from the farthest point, for the exclusion of evil.
29.8.34	And one makes the brother the inferior one.
29.8.35-38	If one desires that the Brāhmaṇa should be more powerful than the Kṣatriya, one should make the Brāhmaṇas more powerful than the Ksatriyas. He makes the Brāhmaņas more powerful than the ksatriyas. If one desires that the Kṣatriyas should be more powerful, one should make them more powerful than the Viśas. He makes them more powerful than them. If one wishes that the Viśas should be more powerful.
29.8.39	If one desires, he should make all equal. It would be a sin.
29.8.40	One makes it a sin.
29.8.41	The Tvashtri is measured for the support of the directions.
29.8.42	The upward ones are measured for the support (of the worlds).
29.8.43	One should not measure the sacrificial post outside the altar.
29.8.44	One should not exceed the altar.
29.8.45	The sacrificer is the sacrificial post.
29.8.46	The earth is as big as the altar.
29.8.47	If one were to erect the sacrificial post outside the altar, one would deprive the sacrificer of the earth.
29.8.48	If one extends beyond the altar, one deprives one's brother of the world.
29.8.49	One should erect it equal to the altar.
29.8.50	One does not deprive the sacrificer.
29.8.51	One does deprive one's brother.
29.8.52-56	If one were to pour out (the Soma) according to the Uparasa, one would desire that one would prosper in the world of the fathers. One would prosper in the very world of the fathers.
29.8.57	He prospers in the world of the gods.
29.8.58	He prospers in all these worlds.
29.8.59	He measures with the axle of a chariot.
29.8.60	The sacrificial post is indeed a thunderbolt.
29.8.61	The chariot is a thunderbolt.
29.8.62	He places the thunderbolt on the thunderbolt.
29.8.63	All the posts should be made facing the fire.
29.8.64	One should place the posts facing the fire.
29.8.65	All the Agniṣṭhas are performed by him alone.
29.8.66	If the reins of the Agniṣṭha horse wander, all the Agniṣṭhās are performed by him.
29.8.67	Two.
29.8.68	Two reins reach the sacrificial post.
29.8.69	Therefore women are superior to men.
29.8.70	Therefore one man wins many wives, not one wife many husbands.
29.8.71	The twelfth is the Upashaya.
29.8.72	The year consists of twelve months.
29.8.73	Having turned it to the right, they place it down.
29.8.74	The demons attacked the sacrifice of the gods from the right.
29.8.75	The sacrificial post is a thunderbolt for the destruction of the demons.
29.8.76	If one were to perform a rite of sorcery, one should offer a human animal.
29.8.77	"This I bind to the post, the son of so-and-so, the son of such-and-such." He should place the rope on the post.
29.8.78	The post is indeed a thunderbolt.
29.8.79	He binds him with the thunderbolt.
29.8.80	He then shoots it.
29.8.81	If he does not perform a rite of cursing, he should point out a wild animal.
29.8.82	One should not eat it.
29.8.83	The animals of the forest stand near the Upasaya (altar), those of the village near the Ekadashini (altar).
29.8.84	Because the Vedi is made for the Ekadashinî, therefore the animals of the village are like those that are seen, like those that are quiet.
29.8.85	Because the Upasaya lies like a cave, therefore the animals in the forest wander like those that are in a cave, like those that wander.
29.9.1	Prajapati, having created the creatures, seemed to be dissatisfied.
29.9.2	He saw this Ekadasini (oblation).
29.9.3	He brought it.
29.9.4	He pleased himself with it.
29.9.5	One who feels dissatisfied should bring this Ekadasini at whatever sacrifice.
29.9.6	There are ten breaths in a man,
29.9.7	the self is the eleventh.
29.9.8	He gratifies the self of him as much as it is.
29.9.9	Agni is all the deities.
29.9.10	He is indeed worshipped by these deities.
29.9.11	The Agni is the self.
29.9.12	Speech is Sarasvati.
29.9.13	What is Sarasvati?
29.9.14	He indeed places speech as a companion in the self.
29.9.15	Then the Soma.
29.9.16	Soma is the seed-giver.
29.9.17	He indeed places the seed in the companion.
29.9.18	Now the one for Pusan.
29.9.19	Pusan is cattle.
29.9.20	He generates cattle.
29.9.21	Now the one for Brihaspati.
29.9.22	Brihaspati is Brahman.
29.9.23	He makes Brahman prevail among cattle.
29.9.24	Now (the one) for the All-gods.
29.9.25	These creatures are for the All-Gods.
29.9.26	He makes creatures follow Brahman.
29.9.27	Now (for) Indra.
29.9.28	Indra is the nobility.
29.9.29-37	He thus makes the Kshatra (ruling power) prevail among the offspring. Then the Marut (verse). The Maruts are the Vidyas (knowers). He thus unites the people with the Kshatra. Then the Indra-Agni (verse). Indra and Agni are strength and valour. He thus brings the people to the Kshatra by means of strength and valour. The Savitr (verse) is for prosperity. The Varuna (verse) is to be free from Varuna.
29.9.38	Prajapati created the creatures.
29.9.39	They fled from him.
29.9.40	They went upwards.
29.9.41	They desired, "May they not turn away from us."
29.9.42	He practised austerities.
29.9.43	He offered himself to Medha.
29.9.44	They turned towards him.
29.9.45	They were afraid of him.
29.9.46	They fell down.
29.9.47	Therefore cattle are called "fallen."
29.9.48	They went away from him.
29.9.49	They approached him with oblations, with the sacrifice to the gods, with the grass, with the sprinkling, with the water, with the sacrificial post, with the sacrificial tree, with the animals, with the sheep and goats, with the food and butter, with the cows.
29.9.50	These indeed are the gods who receive oblations.
29.9.51	The sacrifice is Prajapati.
29.9.52	Therefore all of them receive oblations in this way.
29.9.53	Those who know this offer oblations to him.
29.9.54	From their departure, he was afraid.
29.9.55	He united the powers of them in himself.
29.9.56	The Self is Agni.
29.9.57	Speech is Sarasvati.
29.9.58	The sense is Soma.
29.9.59	He unites speech and sense in himself.
29.9.60	Then the Pusan.
29.9.61	Then the Brhaspati.
29.9.62	Pusan is the cattle.
29.9.63	Brihaspati is Brahman.
29.9.64	He places cattle and Brahman within himself.
29.9.65	Then the Visvedeva (rite).
29.9.66	Then the Indra (rite).
29.9.67	The All-gods are indeed strength.
29.9.68	Indra is together.
29.9.69	He places strength and togetherness within himself.
29.9.70	Now the Marut (rite).
29.9.71	Now the Indra-Agni (rite).
29.9.72	The Maruts are strength.
29.9.73	Indra and Agni are power.
29.9.74	He acquires strength and power for himself.
29.9.75	Savitr is for the sake of conception.
29.9.76	Varuna is for the sake freedom from Varuna.
29.10.1	One who desires brahminical lustre, offspring, cattle, and a chaplain should offer the Agniya, Sarasvatiya, Saumya, and Barhaspatya oblations.
29.10.2	The Agniya (rite) is performed.
29.10.3	For Agniya is the Brahman.
29.10.4	The Sarasvati (rite) is done.
29.10.5	Sarasvati is speech.
29.10.6	For one speaks with speech.
29.10.7	The Soma (rite) is offered.
29.10.8	For one drinks Soma.
29.10.9	The Brhaspati (rite) is undertaken.
29.10.10	Brhaspati is Brahman.
29.10.11	Having accomplished the four-footed Brahman, he establishes it.
29.10.12	One becomes endowed with Brahmanic lustre.
29.10.13	Now the one to Pusan.
29.10.14	Pusan is cattle.
29.10.15	He thereby unites cattle with the Brahman.
29.10.16	Now the one to Indra and Agni.
29.10.17	Now the Indra one.
29.10.18	Indra and Agni are the nobility.
29.10.19	Indra is the nobility.
29.10.20	He thereby establishes the nobility.
29.10.21	And he thereby takes cattle with the nobility.
29.10.22	The one to Agni is in the middle, those to Indra are on both sides.
29.10.23	The Brāhmaṇa is Agni's.
29.10.24	The Kṣatriya is Indra's.
29.10.25	Brahma moves in between the Kṣatriya.
29.10.26	He who knows this obtains the Purohita.
29.10.27	Indra and Agni are the most sharers of cattle.
29.10.28	Agni's is the Agniya.
29.10.29	Indra's is the Indriya.
29.10.30	The Aiṇḍra-Agni is together.
29.10.31	Therefore, the Brāhmaṇa and the Kṣatriya are the most deserving of the people.
29.10.32	Then the Vaisvadeva (rite).
29.10.33	Then the Marut (rite).
29.10.34	The Viśve Devas are the Viḍ.
29.10.35	The Maruts are the Viṇ.
29.10.36	Having accomplished the Viśa, he connects it to the Kṣatra.
29.10.37	Having made the Kṣatra the face of Brahman, he connects the Viśa to it.
29.10.38	Sāvitra is for prosperity.
29.10.39	For the removal of Varuna, the Varuna-rite.
29.10.40	Brahma indeed gathers together the right (sacrifices), the right (sacrificial) gifts, and the right (sacrificers).
29.10.41	Where the Ekadashin is performed, there the offspring prosper.
29.10.42	A Brahman becomes a Brahman.
29.10.43	A Rajanya becomes a Rajanya.
29.10.44	A Vaishya becomes a Vaishya.
29.10.45	This is not properly arranged for the Ekadashi (rite). It does not fit in with the progeny.
29.10.46	This indeed is the Ekadashi.
29.10.47	The Kapeyas know this.
29.10.48	One should offer this last Atiratra.
29.10.49	This is the Sattra (rite). The other (rites) are those which the progeny follow when they are in trouble.
29.10.50	This is indeed the arrangement of days.
29.10.51	These are the days belonging to the gods.
30.1.1	The Patnīvata is indeed the begetting of offspring.
30.1.2	Whatever is done at the Patnīvata in the sacrifice, it is indeed the begetter of offspring.
30.1.3	Now the sacrifice is far away.
30.1.4	The deities are far away.
30.1.5	One becomes Tvashtra.
30.1.6	One creates Tvashtra, the bull, among the far away deities.
30.1.7	He makes a pair for him.
30.1.8	This is the thunderbolt that is set up in front, namely the Ekadashini.
30.1.9	He is the lord, the one who brings the sacrifice forward.
30.1.10	When the Patnivat is measured, it is for the sake of turning back and for the sake of being together.
30.1.11	The skull of Manu was there.
30.1.12	With that he attacked the Asuras as many times as he could, and they were defeated.
30.1.13	Then the Trishtup and the Anushtup became the Asura Brahmans.
30.1.14	The Asuras said to them, "Ask for these skull-cups."
30.1.15	Having gone in the morning, they approached (the Asuras) and said, "To Vayu, Agni, Vayu, Indra."
30.1.16	They asked, "What do you desire?"
30.1.17	They said, "Give us these skull-cups," and they gave them to them.
30.1.18	Having taken them to the forest, they mixed them together.
30.1.19	Those cows of Manu stood out.
30.1.20	They were united by the bull.
30.1.21	Those Asuras who listened to his bellow were defeated.
30.1.22	Having gone to the morning, they approached Vayu, Agni, and Indra.
30.1.23	"What was your purpose?" he asked.
30.1.24	With this bull, we shall sacrifice." The wife, speaking the Yajus, approached him.
30.1.25	Her speech stood on the sky.
30.1.26	Those Asuras who listened to her speaking, they were defeated.
30.1.27	Therefore, at night, a woman speaks more clearly.
30.1.28	Having approached in the morning, they approached Vayu, Agni, Indra.
30.1.29	He said, "What desire did you have?"
30.1.30	"We will sacrifice you with this wife of yours." She was placed near the fire.
30.1.31	Then Indra thought:
30.1.32	"Manu, having faith, has made the Triṣṭāvarī (hymn) and the Asura-Brahmā (hymn) to be sung with his wife."
30.1.33	He came.
30.1.34	He said, "I shall sacrifice for you with these two."
30.1.35	He said, 'No.'
30.1.36	He said, I am not the master of these two.'
30.1.37	He said (to him), 'The host is the master of the guest.'
30.1.38	He gave them to him.
30.1.39	He, the guest, remained making a sacrificial altar.
30.1.40	They asked him, 'Who are you?'
30.1.41	He said, A brahmana.
30.1.42	Who is the Brahman?
30.1.43	What is the Brahman? What do you ask about the father, or about the mother?
30.1.44	If it is known that he is the father, he is the grandfather.
30.1.45	They knew that Indra was the father.
30.1.46	They fell down.
30.1.47	From them, the waters that were the sprinkling waters, he cut off the head after following them.
30.1.48	They became Vrsha and Yavasha.
30.1.49	Therefore, they are in the rains.
30.1.50	They were destroyed by water.
30.1.51	He released it after setting it on fire.
30.1.52	He succeeded with it.
30.1.53	These are the offspring of Manu.
30.1.54	When one releases the Paitnivaat after setting it on the fire,
30.1.55	one succeeds in the prosperity that Manu succeeded in.
30.1.56	They debate whether the animal should be set up or not.
30.1.57	The sacrifice flows away if it is not set up.
30.1.58	The sacrificer follows the flowing animal and flows away with offspring and cattle.
30.1.59	One should set up the animal for the establishment of the sacrifice.
30.1.60	If one were to set it up, one should offer as many portions of clarified butter as there are cuts on the animal.
30.1.61	This is the proper portion of Prajapati, namely, ghee.
30.1.62	Prajapati is the proper portion for the gods.
30.1.63	He indeed establishes it.
30.1.64	He does not establish it.
30.1.65	He makes both.
30.2.1	The Indra-Vayu cup is taken first, then the Sukra cup, then the Aggrayan cup.
30.2.2	The Indra Vayu cup is in the Gayatri metre.
30.2.3	The Sukra is in Tristubh metre.
30.2.4	The Agnayan is in Jagat metre.
30.2.5	These are the metres.
30.2.6	The gods went to heaven by means of the metres.
30.2.7	One goes to heaven by means the metres.
30.2.8	Agnayan is on the fourth day.
30.2.9	Agnayen is in Jagat.
30.2.10	This three-day sacrifice has Jagat as its beginning.
30.2.11-18	Whatever verse he obtains, with that he performs the subsequent three-day (rite). The five-day (rite) begins with the Indra-Vayu (cup). The Indra-Vayu is Gāyatrī. Prāṇa is Gāyatrīs. He places Prāṇa in the middle. Therefore Prāṇa is in the middle. The sixth day begins with Sukra. Sukra is Trishtubh.
30.2.19	This Tri-night is in Tristubh.
30.2.20	He indeed lifts it up to the end.
30.2.21	In the seventh day, it is indeed in Sukra.
30.2.22	Sukra is in Tristubha.
30.2.23	This is in Tristubhas, in the form of a Chhandas, for the purpose of being lifted up and for the purpose of prosperity.
30.2.24	And whatever Chhandas he attains, by that he extends the subsequent Tri-night.
30.2.25	The Grahas are led by the Aggrayaṇa on the eighth day.
30.2.26	The Aggrayaṇa is the leader of the Jagatī.
30.2.27	This is the Chandomas of the Jagat.
30.2.28	He follows the arrangement of the Chandomas.
30.2.29	The Prāyaniya and Udayaniya Grahas are led respectively by the Indra-Vāyu and the Indra-Vayu.
30.2.30	The Indra-Vāyava is the breath.
30.2.31	They proceed with breath.
30.2.32	They rise with breath.
30.2.33	The Grahas are the breaths.
30.2.34	He confuses them by taking them in the reverse order.
30.2.35	If he were to take them in the reverse, he should not sit down until he has placed them.
30.2.36	The Grahas are the vital airs.
30.2.37	He places the vital airs in their own place.
30.2.38	Then the remaining ones are taken.
30.2.39	Thus indeed did they seize the Grahas at the time of the cutting of the hair of Keshi Dālbhya.
30.2.40	He said, "How did you seize the Grahas?"
30.2.41	They said, "Thus and thus."
30.2.42	He said, "His subjects will be divided into three parts."
30.2.43	Then the Panchalas became divided into three parts.
30.2.44	Those whose Grahas are taken in this way, their progeny becomes three-fold.
30.3.1	One should take the Grahas beginning with Indra-Vayu, if one desires that his progeny should be arranged in the proper order.
30.3.2	One's progeny is arranged according to the arrangement of the sacrifice.
30.3.3	If the sacrifice is not arranged, the progeny is not arranged.
30.3.4	One arranges one's progeny in the proper order.
30.3.5	The younger does not go beyond the elder.
30.3.6	One should take the Indra-Vayu cup first for one who is afflicted with a disease.
30.3.7	One who is afflicted with disease is deprived of his life.
30.3.8	The Indra-Vayu is the life.
30.3.9	He makes him whole with life.
30.3.10	One should first take the Mitra-Varuna cup for one whose initiates die.
30.3.11-17	Those whose initiated ones die, they are deprived of the vital airs Prāṇa and Apāna. Prāṇa and Apāṇa are Mitra and Varuna. They remove Prāṇa and Apaṇa from the mouth. Therefore, Prāṇa and Āpāna are from the mouth. One who is younger should take the first portion of the Aśvinī constellation. Aśvinī is the younger of the gods. They went to the front.
30.3.18	The two Asvins are the deities of one who is the youngest brother.
30.3.19	One approaches them.
30.3.20	They lead him to the front.
30.3.21	One should take the bright ones, for one who has lost his prosperity.
30.3.22	The bright one is the sun.
30.3.23	This is the end.
30.3.24	Having gone to the end of prosperity, a man returns.
30.3.25	One approaches from the end.
30.3.26	He does not become more sinful than he was when he performed the sacrifice.
30.3.27	One who is practising sorcery should take the ladle for churning.
30.3.28	The ladle for churning is a vessel of distress.
30.3.29	He seizes him with death.
30.3.30	One who has been practised sorcery should take the Utkhya ladle.
30.3.31	The Utkhya ladle is the strength and energy of all the vessels.
30.3.32	He uses him with all his strength.
30.3.33	May not my fields be barren, may not my cattle be barren, may I not be deprived of milk.
30.3.34	May we not eat the food of one who has committed a crime.
30.3.35	O Sarasvati, lead us to prosperity.
30.3.36	The fields of Death are barren.
30.3.37	By that (verse) one does not go to the fields of Death.
30.3.38-41	One should take the Āgrayana (graha) if one's father and grandfather were virtuous, but one did not obtain it. One is deprived of speech and power if one's fathers and grandfathers were virtuous, but he did not obtain it.
30.3.42-47	He should take full Grahas for one who is afflicted with a disease. The disease of one who is afflicted by a disease strikes his vital airs. The vital airs are the Grahas. He releases the disease from his vital airs. He should take full grahas when the rain god does not rain. The disease strikes the vital airs of beings when the rain god doesn't rain.
30.3.48	The vital airs are the Grahas.
30.3.49	He releases the vital airs from the impurity of creatures.
30.3.50	It rains immediately.
30.7.1	The gods and the Asuras performed the sacrifice together.
30.7.2	Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did that.
30.7.3	The gods saw this invincible (Agni).
30.7.4	They grasped it.
30.7.5	"I offer thee to Agni, to the Gāyatrī metre."
30.7.6	He thus attains both the deity and the metres.
30.7.7	"May Agni protect us at the morning pressing."
30.7.8	He thus obtains the pressings.
30.7.9	"I take thee, bright, with the bright."
30.7.10	He thus reaches the form of the day and night.
30.7.11	"I shake thee in the path of the rays."
30.7.12	They indeed obtain the forms of the waters.
30.7.13	Those gods, having taken the sacrifice as it was, offered it.
30.7.14	The Asuras understood that which was offered.
30.7.15	They said, "We have not eaten."
30.7.16	That is its name-giving.
30.7.17	And because they were unable to catch him, he became the Adabhya.
30.7.18	He is taken for the purpose of catching one's enemy.
30.7.19	He is grasped with the Nigraha formulas.
30.7.20	Soma is grasped with curd.
30.7.21	Soma is curd.
30.7.22	The vessel has four corners.
30.7.23	There are four directions.
30.7.24	He stands firm in the directions.
30.7.25	They indeed kill Soma when they press it.
30.7.26	This is the last body of that (Soma) which is pressed before the Ādābhya (pressing).
30.7.27	He indeed goes to the world of heaven, following that very body which is not killed.
30.7.28	The sacrificer follows that.
30.7.29	For he is the sacrificer.
30.7.30	He indeed is in the other world with all his bodies, for whom this (Soma) is taken.
30.7.31	He who goes to rest before the Soma-pressing, severs the sacrifice.
30.7.32	When he sprinkles the Soma-stalks which have not been pressed, it is for the continuity of the sacrifice.
30.7.33	They say that there is no hymn without a praise.
30.7.34	He is without a support.
30.7.35	Three times he says, "For the Vasus, the pressing."
30.7.36	This is the hymn.
30.7.37	This is the praise.
30.7.38	The Gaurīvita is the Sama.
30.7.39	The gods, when they divided the Brahman,
30.7.40	what was left over became the Gaurīvita.
30.7.41	The Gaurīvita indeed is the excess.
30.7.42	The Atigrahyas are the excess.
30.7.43	One obtains the excess by means of the excess.
30.7.44	Where there is the Gaurīvitam Sama, one should also take many Atigrahyas.
30.7.45	By that alone he makes them (belonging) to the Samaveda, to the Uktha, to the Nidana, to the Ayatana.
30.7.46	He who knows this becomes one who has Nidana and Ayatana.  
30.9.1	Indeed, Prajapati's animals were not born and were being born, Rudra's were born.
30.9.2	One who performs with an animal that is not fit, he who takes an animal that belongs to these two without asking, performs with an animal unfit.
30.9.3	The animal is given to the two who have asked for it, and he is let loose with their permission.
30.9.4	He prospers.
30.9.5	They say that the animal, while alive, should be sent to heaven.
30.9.6	Those who know this accept it.
30.9.7	The first.
30.9.8	He sends him to heaven while he is alive.
30.9.9	And those domestic animals and those wild animals, they meditate on this animal being offered.
30.9.10	The sacrificer is the lord, the animal is the defeated one.
30.9.11	Those wild animals which are bound and follow the one being bound, of various forms, this is the release of the animals.
30.9.12	He offers five oblations.
30.9.13	Animals are fivefold.
30.9.14	The animal goes to heaven as far as it goes.
30.9.15	When he makes him smell, he offers the animal that is indicated.
30.9.16	They say, "The animal is the sacrifice, and the sacrificer offers this animal from the sacrifice."
30.9.17	"Where then is the sacrificer?"
30.9.18	"The sacrificer is different from the animal," they say.
30.9.19	He turns away the breaths of both.
30.9.20	He says, "The sacrifice is different from the breath," because he is afraid that the sacrifice may be deficient.
30.9.21	"May the sacrifice bestow a perfect life on the sacrificer."
30.9.22	He thus makes up for the deficiency of the sacrifice.
30.9.23	The ropes are the animals and the sacrificer in the other world, for he does not release the noose of these two.
30.9.24	The gods, the summoners, have released the oblation of the gods. Release the noose of the animal, release the noose of Varuna, release the nouse of the lord of sacrifice. He releases the noose of both of them, the noose of varuna.
30.9.25	He who has this done to him is indeed released in the other world.
30.9.26	If he were to perform a rite against someone who hates us, may that one be below. We release these nooses against him." He should place a post or a piece of wood.
30.9.27	He releases the noose against him, the noose of Varuna.
30.9.28	When one performs the animal sacrifice, one weakens the Ahavaniya fire.
30.9.29	"They have made thee the first, the most discerning, the most worthy of sacrifice." He makes him worthy of sacrifice, fit for sacrifice.
30.9.30	"Jātavedas, go to the gods with the oblation." He sends him to the heavenly world.
30.9.31	Whatever was impure in the sacrifice of the Rishis and the gods, they purified it with these (verses).
30.9.32	Whatever is impure in his sacrifice, he purifies it with these.
30.10.7	Now this very same is called Parna.
30.10.8	When it becomes a leaf-branch, he obtains that very Soma.
30.10.9	The gods, O Brahman, consulted together.
30.10.10	Parna heard that.
30.10.11	His name is Sushrava.
30.10.12	He who knows this does not become deaf.
30.10.13	When he offers with the leaf-branch, it is with Brahman that he offers.
30.10.14	Prajapati created the animals.
30.10.15	This god approached them.
30.10.16	He pacified him with a shamī.
30.10.17	That is the reason for the name of the shamī.
30.10.18	When one offers with a shamī twig, it is for peace.
30.10.19	The darbha grass is the power of water and plants.
30.10.20-25	When he offers with darbha-blades, he offers them with the brilliance of water and plants. "He says, "To Iṣa thee, to Urja thee." He places Iṣa and Urja in the sacrifice." "He says "You are Vayu." Vayu is the overlord of the atmosphere." Animals are deities of the atmosphere. Vayu himself gives them over to the atmosphere.
30.10.26-31	He indeed makes them go away when he says, "O Vāyu, you are here." For the wind is like the forest. "O Vāyu you are here" he says, making the animals go away for the sacrificer. "May god Savitr release you" - for prosperity. "For the best deed" - for the sacrifice is the best deed.
30.10.32	"You are the goddesses who nourish, the share of the gods."
30.10.33	They used to be nourished from the calves and humans.
30.10.34	Now he nourishes them only from the gods.
30.10.35	"With offspring, without disease, without consumption."
30.10.36	He makes them with offspring, without disease and consumption.
30.10.37	May no thief injure you, may no slanderer injure you. He invokes a blessing.
30.10.38	May the curse of Rudra encompass you.
30.10.39	He encompasses Rudra with the animals.
30.10.40	Rudra does not injure the animals of him who knows this and offers the cows to the oblation knowing this.
30.10.41	"May the firm ones be in this cowherd!" Thus he makes them firm.
30.10.42	"Many!" Thus he makes it reach the earth.
30.10.43	"Protect the animals of the sacrificer!" For the protection of the animals of the worshipper.
30.10.44	He covers the branch facing west.
30.10.45	Therefore, in the evening, domestic animals come to the village from the forest.
30.10.46	If one were to collect the grass from the forest, it would be lost.
31.1.1	Prajapati knew the grass.
31.1.2	The horse is Prajapati.
31.1.3	If one offers grass with horse hair, it is for the non-injury of plants.
31.1.4	"With the impulse of the divine Savitr," he takes it with the deities.
31.1.5-11	"Thou art the seat of the cows," he says; he thus bestows wealth on the sacrificer. "The Rakshas are repelled," he says; thus he repels the Rakshas from the beginning of the sacrifice. "The mind has gone to the excellent, to the sacrificial grass," he says. Mind is knowledge. He thus says, "To knowledge." "Made by Manu, established by Svāhā," he says. For this (earth) was made by Manu, established with Svāhā.
31.1.12	"O Urva, do thou sprinkle the space between heaven and earth." For the purpose of completeness.
31.1.13	"Thou art the gift of Indra."
31.1.14	Whatever there is here, that is the gift of Indra.
31.1.15	Just as one does an act after having told it for the sake of welfare, so also he gives the sacrificial grass after having told it to Indra.
31.1.16	Whatever is not given when one has sprinkled all directions, that is the excess of the sacrifice.
31.1.17	Whatever is in excess of the sacrifice, that he increases his enemies with.
31.1.18	One should offer a single stalk.
31.1.19	So that all may be given, and the sacrifice not be in excess.
31.1.20	If all is given, then life is not cut off from the animals.
31.1.21	One should sprinkle one or two Śaṇṭis.
31.1.22	He does not exceed the sacrifice.
31.1.23	He sprinkles life from the animals.
31.1.24	"May I prosper below and above." For prosperity.
31.1.25	"May the cutter not injure you."
31.1.26	As long as the Adhvaryu does not know the extent of the sacrificial grass, so long is his own self measured.
31.1.27	He whose own self is not measured, he who knows this,
31.1.28	"May the divine sacrificial grass grow with a hundred shoots." He establishes the earth in the plants.
31.1.29	"May we grow with a thousand shoots." He invokes a blessing.
31.1.30	"The breast-plate of Aditi."
31.1.31	This is Aditi.
31.1.32	He makes her a breast-plate.
31.1.33	"The armour of Indra's wife."
31.1.34	Indrani first among the deities put on armour.
31.1.35	For success and prosperity.
31.1.36	He puts on the sacrificial grass.
31.1.37	Sacrificial grass is offspring.
31.1.38	for the welfare of the offspring.
31.1.39	Therefore offspring are continuous.
31.1.40	May Pūṣan tie your knot.
31.1.41	Pūṣan is indeed nourishment.
31.1.42	He places nourishment in the sacrificer.
31.1.43	May it be yours. For non-injury.
31.1.44	He lifts it with Indra's arms. He lifts it with Indra himself.
31.1.45	"I take thee with the head of Brihaspati."
31.1.46	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman.
31.1.47	He takes it with Brahman.
31.1.48	"Thou art the way to the gods."
31.1.49	Much of it falls down on the previous day when it is being brought.
31.1.50	He gives it to the gods without any loss.
31.1.51	"The sages bring it in front."
31.1.52	The sages are indeed Brahmanas.
31.1.53	The Brahmanas indeed bring this (Soma).
31.1.54	"He makes it agreeable to the gods, saying, 'The sacrificial grass has been seated here for the gods.'
31.2.1	" "He says, 'Thou art the filter of Vasus, having a hundred streams; thou art the filter of the Vasus, having thousand streams.'
31.2.2	" The filter is indeed the share of the Vasus.
31.2.3	He makes it for them.
31.2.4	Prajapati created the creatures.
31.2.5	His two milking vessels were lost.
31.2.6	He saw these two milking vessels.
31.2.7	He took them.
31.2.8	Because these are the milking vessels, he restores them to Prajapati.
31.2.9	"He says, "I unite you with offspring free from disease," he makes them free from disease."
31.2.10	"He says "May you be abundant with prosperity," he makes it reach the earth."
31.2.11-16	"May they be filled with honey and ghee," he says; he thus makes the offering to the gods filled with honey and with ghee. "May we live, may we live long, may we live to old age," he says; thus he prays for a blessing. "Thou art the heat of Matarisvan," he says. The heat of Matarisva is indeed the atmosphere. "Thou are heaven, thou art earth," he says. He thus makes it heaven and earth.
31.2.17	You have been drawn forth by the supreme power of the universe. Do not be afraid. Thus she is firmly established.
31.2.18	He places the filter.
31.2.19	He mixes the milk of plants and animals.
31.2.20	It is the universal life, the universal expanse, the universal support.
31.2.21	The universal life is the sky, the universal expanse is the atmosphere, the universal support is this earth.
31.2.22	He bestows these worlds as they were before.
31.2.23	These worlds are bestowed on him as they were before, they yield milk.
31.2.24	He recites three Yajus verses.
31.2.25	These are the three worlds.
31.2.26	He places the essence in these worlds.
31.2.27	Therefore the beings of these worlds live.
31.2.28	He who knows this becomes one who is to be lived upon.
31.2.29	He recites the formula, "Huto stoka, huto drapsa" for non-scattering.
31.2.30	"To Agni Bṛhat, to the sky, svāhā."
31.2.31	This is Agni.
31.2.32	The sky is vast.
31.2.33	Much of this being milked scatters.
31.2.34	He establishes it in this very (earth) for non-scattering
31.2.35	One should not milk in a wooden vessel.
31.2.36	A wooden vessel is Agni.
31.2.37-44	One should offer with exhausted oblations. Now they say, the Dartayas: The oblation has the shape of a cake. There is no cake in the oblation. A Śūdra should not milk. He has arisen from the non-existent. He would be non-existent. Whatever is beyond the filter, that is the oblation.
31.2.45	The Śūdra should not milk the Agnihotra.
31.2.46	For that is not purified.
31.2.47	"He brings back with the verse, "Do ye unite with the truthful ones." For the purpose of being cooked."
31.2.48	For the gods desire cooked food.
31.2.49	"He says, "I am offering thy share of Indra with Soma."
31.2.50	He makes it Soma."
31.2.51	Soma is the indirect offering of the gods.
31.2.52	Now, indeed, the Soma-drink of him who, knowing this, offers with Sannāyya, is uninterrupted.
31.2.53	"You are the unseen one, O Vishnu."
31.2.54	Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
31.2.55	He makes it unseen for the sacrifice.
31.2.56	One should not offer into a clay vessel.
31.2.57	If one were to offer into a clayvessel, the oblation would be dedicated to the Pitrs.
31.2.58	He places it in a wooden vessel.
31.2.59	A wooden vessel is connected with Agni.
31.2.60	Agni alone protects the oblation.
31.2.61	One should make it like a pond.
31.2.62	Water is the destroyer of demons, for the removal of demons.
31.2.63	"One should say, "O Vishnu, protect the oblation."
31.2.64	Vishnu alone protects the oblution.
31.2.65	"One says, "Water is awake."
31.2.66	Water is the protector of the sacrifice.
31.2.67	He gives it to them only.
31.3.1	He sprinkles water.
31.3.2	Water is the sacrifice.
31.3.3	He proceeds having known the sacrifice.
31.3.4	Water is a dear abode of the gods.
31.3.5	He proceeds, having led the dear abode of the Gods.
31.3.6	Water is destructive of Rakshas, for the destruction of Rakshas.
31.3.7	Water is thunderbolt.
31.3.8	He strikes his foe with the thunderbolt.
31.3.9	The waters are faith.
31.3.10	The gods and men give faith to him who knows this, and to him who offers the waters with this knowledge.
31.3.11	"He offers the waters with the formula, "For your deed." He offers the waters with both hands."
31.3.12	This is indeed a deed that is being done.
31.3.13	"He says, "You are of the wood, you are of the wood. You have repelled the Rakshas." He thus repels the Rakshas from the mouth of the sacrifice.
31.3.14	"O Urva, the sky, do thou scatter!" for the sake of completeness.
31.3.15	"Thou art the Dhūrva, the Dhūrva-scattering."
31.3.16	For Agni is indeed the Dhūrva.
31.3.17	If one were to cross over without having touched it, one would cause the sacrificer to be afflicted with impurity.
31.3.18	For a man has two enemies, the one whom he hates and the one who hates him.
31.3.19	He causes them to be afflicted with his impurity.
31.3.20-24	"Thou art the best of the gods," he says; verily he makes him the best of the deities. "The step of Vishnu, thou art not to be shaken, thou art the sacrificial post, be firm, do not shake," he says; he makes it firm. "I look at thee with the eye of Mitra," he says; it is Mitra he makes it. "May the wind enlarge thee," he says; whatever wind blows, that belongs to Varuna.
31.3.25-31	He makes it free from the Rishis. "With the impulse of the divine Savitr" - he offers it with the impulse of Savitr, to the deities. "For the one who is dear" - he makes it dear to the deity for whom he offers. "May the five (deities) give you" - there are five seasons. He pleases the seasons.
31.3.32	They are pleased with him and are favourable to him.
31.3.33	Those who know this, the seasons are favourable to them.
31.3.34	For the protection of thee, for the removal of the Rakshas.
31.3.35	This is of the gods, this is with us. For the exclusion.
31.3.36	The heaven is to be seen.
31.3.37	He indeed approaches him like darkness, the final one.
31.3.38	He indeed sees the heaven.
31.3.39	These worlds were shaken when the oblation was taken up.
31.3.40	The gods steadied them with this Yajus.
31.3.41	"He steadies these worlds, saying, "May the roads be steadied."
31.3.42	One should say, "Carry the oblation to the firm sky."
31.3.43	The Adhvaryu would be without a companion.
31.3.44	"One should say, "Carry the oblation into the firm sky."
31.3.45	The Adhvaryu becomes without a companion, he who knows thus.
31.3.46	"O Agni, protect the offering!" he places it down.
31.3.47	Agni indeed protects the offering.
31.4.1	"With Vishnu's mind, you are purified." He purifies them indeed.
31.4.2	"May the god Savitr purify you." He purifises them indeed with the deity Savitr.
31.4.3	"With the impulse of the divine Savitr" - he sprinkles it with the impulse of Savitr, the deity.
31.4.4	"For the one who is dear" - he makes it dear to the deity for whom he sprinkles.
31.4.5	"May the vessels be purified for the sacrifice to the gods" - he purifies them for the gods.
31.4.6	"Avadhūta, the destroyer of the Rākṣasas, the destroyer of Rākṣasa enemies, for the destruction of the Rākśasas.
31.4.7	"You are the skin of Aditi."
31.4.8	This is Aditi.
31.4.9	He makes it her skin.
31.4.10	"You belong to the tree, you are the arrow." He makes it an arrow.
31.4.11	"You, O Agni, are the body, the release of speech."
31.4.12	For this is Agni's body, the release of speech.
31.4.13	For when the cattle eat the plants, then they release speech.
31.4.14	"He says, 'Thou art the great stone, the wooden one.' Having made it a stone, he makes it an offering.
31.4.15	"Come, O maker of offerings!"
31.4.16	He invites the maker of offerings of the gods.
31.4.17	He invites three times.
31.4.18	The gods are the three truths.
31.4.19	You are the mountain, the poet, the destroyer of demons, the destroyer of enemies, for the destruction of demons.
31.4.20	We conquer each group of enemies.
31.4.21	He conquers each group of enemies, his rival.
31.4.22	The speech of the sacrificer of the god of faith, Manot, entered the sacrificial implements.
31.4.23	Those Asuras who listened to them were defeated.
31.4.24	One who, knowing this, performs a sacrifice among his enemies, those of his enemies who listen to the weapons of sacrifice, he takes away their strength and energy.
31.4.25	One becomes one's own self.
31.4.26	One's enemy becomes defeated.
31.4.27	You are the one who grows with the years, I am the one who grows.
31.4.28	He makes it a couple.
31.4.29	The gods drove away the demons from the animals with the chaff and the plants.
31.4.30	"The demon is completely purified, the enemy is completely purified." With just this much he drives away the demons from sacrifice.
31.4.31	"The one who wishes evil is driven away."
31.4.32	Or the enemy is the one who wishes evil.
31.4.33	He indeed repels the enemy.
31.4.34	"He makes the offering with the verse, "May Vayu, the purifier, separate us from the evil."
31.4.35	Vayu is indeed the purifier of the gods.
31.4.36	He indeed purifies them.
31.4.37	He makes them fruitful.
31.4.38	He indeed makes them worthy of sacrifice.
31.4.39	He makes the offering three times.
31.4.40	The gods are indeed true three times.
31.5.1	"The Avadhūta, the Avadhūtarāti, the destroyer of Rakshas.
31.5.2	" "Thou art the skin of Aditi." "
31.5.3	This is Aditi.
31.5.4	He makes him the skin of her.
31.5.5	" "O Dhishana, thou art the mountain-born.
31.5.6	" "May the Adityas know thee as the skin." "
31.5.7	" "Thou dost press the earth." "
31.5.8	He presses the earth.
31.5.9	" "Dhishana, thou mountain-born.
31.5.10-18	May Parvati know thee. "He says, 'Thou art the support of heaven.' He indeed supports heaven. He places the wooden wedge, saying, 'Thou art a support of heaven.' These two were indeed together. They went apart by the extent of a wooden wedge. The wooden wedge is the thunderbolt. In that he places the wooden wedge (he does so) for the support of these two. Thou art the support.
31.5.19	"Praise the gods!"
31.5.20	By the power of this mantra, one can attain whatever one desires.
31.5.21	Whatever one desires, that much is attained by offering this.
31.5.22	"For your breath, for your circulation, for your out-breath." He places them in the sacrificer.
31.5.23	"For a long, continuous life, for your life." He places life in him.
31.5.24	May the god Savitar, with golden hands, accept this.
31.5.25	They indeed move forward like a deer.
31.5.26	For stability.
31.5.27	I look with your unerring eye. For the protection of the eyes.
31.5.28	For prosperity, for offspring, for good offspring. He indeed prays for blessings.
31.6.1	"The Rakshas is burnt, the Rakshas is destroyed." Thus for the destruction of the Rakshas.
31.6.2	"O Agni, drive away the raw Agni." Thus for the removal of the raw Agni.
31.6.3	He places the raw Agni, the eater of raw flesh, for the removal of that raw Agni, in the place of the sacrifice.
31.6.4	When he puts the raw Agni below, he places light in this world by that.
31.6.5	Whatever he places above, that he places in the atmosphere. By that he bestows light.
31.6.6	His sun becomes light in the yonder world.
31.6.7	All these worlds of his become luminous.
31.6.8	He places three Samiçana bricks.
31.6.9	The three breaths are Prāṇa, Vyāna, and Apāna.
31.6.10	He places them in the sacrificer.
31.6.11	These are the three worlds.
31.6.12	He prospers in these worlds alone.
31.6.13	"You are firm, you hold the earth firm." He holds the earth firm.
31.6.14	"He gives life, he gives breath." He prays for a blessing.
31.6.15	"You hold firm, you hold space firm." He holds space firm.
31.6.16	"You give sight." He prays for blessing.
31.6.17	"You are the support, you hold the heaven." He indeed holds the heaven.
31.6.18	"Give strength, give power." He indeed prays for a blessing.
31.6.19	"You are the law, you hold the directions." He indeed holds (the directions).
31.6.20	"Give wealth, give nourishment." He indeed prays (for a blessing).
31.6.21	"You are a machine, you hold the regions." He indeed holds them.
31.6.22	He prays for a blessing when he says, "Give me form, give me color."
31.6.23	Prajapati, when he first came into existence, came into existence as just this much.
31.6.24	First one skull-bone of the head comes into existence, then a second, then a third, then a fourth, then a fifth, then a sixth, then a seventh, then an eighth.
31.6.25	When he lays down eight well-arranged (bricks), the sacrificer thus prepares himself.
31.6.26	When prepared, he follows him in the other world.
31.6.27	When he lays down eight (bricks), he attains the Gayatri metre; when eleven, the Tristubh; when twelve, the Jagati.
31.6.28	He lays down (bricks) of the size of the metres.
31.6.29	He makes all the verses with the Yajus.
31.6.30	"He makes them recite, "Be heated by the penance of the Bhrigus and Angiras."
31.6.31	He makes them heated by the penance (of the gods) of these very deities.
31.6.32	"The potsherds which the wise ones collect in the heat,
31.6.33	" This sun is the heat.
31.6.34	Its directions are the potsherds.
31.6.35	He thus releases them according to their respective places.
31.6.36	"He says, "May Indra-Vayu release them, the vows of Pūṣan," thus he makes Indra-Vayu their releasers.
31.7.1	" "He says, "By the impulse of the divine Savitr."
31.7.2	" He consecrates him with the impulse of Savitr.
31.7.3	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, "For him who is dear."
31.7.4	He makes it the offering to the very same deity for whom he is offering.
31.7.5	He makes it agreeable to her.
31.7.6	He offers with the strainer.
31.7.7	He makes the offering.
31.7.8	He sprinkles it.
31.7.9	Water is immortality.
31.7.10	He makes his offering immortal.
31.7.11	"The waters are united with the plants, the plants are united with the juice."
31.7.12	Or other plants than these do the work of these.
31.7.13	"What is your Revati, your Revati, what is your Havishya, your Havishya; what is your Jagati, your Jagati."
31.7.14	The Revati plants are the waters.
31.7.15	The Madhumati plants are the herbs.
31.7.16	The Jagati plants are the cattle.
31.7.17	He makes them all one with the waters, the herbs, and the cattle, and makes them sweet.
31.7.18	"He joins (the two ends) with, 'Thou art the generator.'
31.7.19	He makes it a couple.
31.7.20	'Thou art the head of the sacrifice,' he says.
31.7.21	The sacrifice is the sacrifice.
31.7.22	He makes it the head of the sacrificer.
31.7.23	'Thou are the heat, of long life, spread out widely; may thy lord of sacrifice spread out widely,' he says. He spreads it out.
31.7.24	'The protection is repelled,' he says. From the mouth of the sacrifice he repels the Rakshas.
31.7.25	The Puròàasa is the heat which is removed every fortnight.
31.7.26	It is the fierce, unconquered heat which burns the sacrificer's cattle.
31.7.27	When he makes the fire go round, he makes it a cattle, for peace and non-burning.
31.7.28	He removes it three times.
31.7.29	These are the three worlds.
31.7.30	He appeases it from these worlds.
31.7.31	The Purorasa (cake) which was placed (on the fire) was attacked by the Rakshas.
31.7.32	The Rakshas-destroying Agni named Naka is in heaven.
31.7.33	He drove away the Rakshas from here.
31.7.34	May the god Savitar cook thee, in the highest heaven, for the driving away of the Rakshas;
31.7.35	May Agni not injure thy body, for non-injury.
31.7.36	He makes the skin firm.
31.7.37	Therefore, the brain is all around.
31.7.38	The bones of the head are the skull bones.
31.7.39	The brain is the sacrificial cake.
31.7.40	If one were to cover the navel, the brain would appear.
31.7.41	Because one covers it, the brain is hidden.
31.7.42	One covers it with ashes.
31.7.43	Therefore, the bones are covered with flesh.
31.7.44	The Veda is the means of knowing.
31.7.45	Therefore the head is covered with hair.
31.7.46	Those gods did not find him in whom they could perform the sacrifice.
31.7.47	Agni said,
31.7.48	"I will generate him in whom you can perform the sacrifice."
31.7.49	He struck the water with a burning coal.
31.7.50	From that, one was born.
31.7.51	The second.
31.7.52	Then from the second.
31.7.53	The third.
31.7.54	Then from three.
31.7.55	What he fashioned for himself, that is the nature of what belongs to oneself.
31.7.56	What he created from the waters, that is the character of what belongs to the waters.
31.7.57	He places it inside the altar.
31.7.58	He thus obtains it.
31.7.59	He sprinkles it with a lump of clay for the purpose of cooking.
31.7.60	The gods desire cooking.
31.7.61	They went to the Ati-mṛjānā.
31.7.62	When the sun rose, they became mṛjānā
31.7.63	When the sun rises and sets,
31.7.64	When the sun sets, one with black nails.
31.7.65	One with black nails, when the hair turns gray.
31.7.66	When the hair turns gray, when the beard is white.
31.7.67	When the beard is white, when one is about to die.
31.7.68	When one is about to pass away, when one is in the front.
31.8.3	You are Indra's right arm, the thousand-arrowed one, the hundred-rayed one.
31.8.4	The spade is indeed a thunderbolt.
31.8.5	He indeed strikes with the thunderbolt.
31.8.6	When about to strike his brother, he says, "O Earth, the place of sacrifice of the gods, I do not injure the roots of the plants." For the non-injury of the plants.
31.8.7	"Go to the village, to the cattle-shed."
31.8.8	The Chhandas are the herd, the place of cattle.
31.8.9	He makes for him the herd, the cattle-place.
31.8.10	"May the sky rain for you." He directs the rain.
31.8.11	"O god Savitar, bind him with a hundred fetters in the farthest earth."
31.8.12	There are two kinds of enemies of a man, the one whom he hates and the one who hates him.
31.8.13	He binds her with a hundred ropes in the highest earth.
31.8.14	"He says, "May the dew not fall from the sky."
31.8.15	What is her juice, that is the dew.
31.8.16	These creatures subsist on it.
31.8.17	He places it in her for her to ascend.
31.8.18	"He (the Adhvaryu) says, "May Araru not fall from the heaven."
31.8.19	The enemy is Araru.
31.8.20	He indeed drives away his enemy from the world of heaven.
31.8.21	There was an Asura named Araru.
31.8.22	He feared, "The gods will overcome us through sacrifice."
31.8.23	He smeared the earth with poison, making it impure.
31.8.24	Indra killed Vritra.
31.8.25	His blood flowed here.
31.8.26	It became impure.
31.8.27	Whatever he throws up, that is his unclean, un-sacrificial (act).
31.8.28	There was an Asura named Araru.
31.8.29	He was afraid, (thinking): "The gods will not let me be on the earth."
31.8.30	He lay down on the earth.
31.8.31	Indra thought of him.
31.8.32	"Remove Araru, the non-sacrificer, from the sacrificial place on the earth."
31.8.33	He removed the earth.
31.8.34	He fell down from heaven.
31.8.35	"So that Araru does not fall from heaven."
31.8.36	He was brought back from heaven.
31.8.37	Then the gods became (victorious).
31.8.38	The Asuras became (defeated).
31.8.39-42	For him who knows thus, if the Stambayajus is taken away, or if he who knows thus takes it away, he excludes his enemy from these worlds. He becomes superior to his enemy.
31.8.43	That Agni conquered the eastern direction, the Vasus the southern, the Rudras the western, and the Adityas the northern.
31.8.44	Those gods found this (world) among the Asuras.
31.8.45	Then the gods became (victorious),
31.8.46	and the Asuras were defeated.
31.8.47	He who knows this, and who encloses the altar with these deities, wins his enemy's world. He himself becomes superior, and his enemy inferior.
31.8.48	From the earth, the pure and the impure went forth.
31.8.49	The pure went forth towards the east and north; the impure towards the west and south.
31.8.50	He should make the altar slope towards the east or the north.
31.8.51	He makes it fit for sacrifice and worthy of being offered.
31.8.52	And also for the separation of the fit from the unfit.
31.8.53	He raises his arms towards the east.
31.8.54	He encloses the Āhavanīya.
31.8.55	The buttocks are towards the west.
31.8.56	He encircles the Garhapatya.
31.8.57	The Rakshas follow the root.
31.8.58	One should not cut with a nail.
31.8.59	If one were to cut with a nail, one would have a deformed nail.
31.8.60	One cuts with a wooden stick.
31.8.61	The wooden stick is a thunderbolt.
31.8.62	One destroys the Rakshas with the thunderbolt.
31.9.1	Ghee and honey were Prajapati.
31.9.2	From where there was honey, from there he created beings.
31.9.3	Therefore, there is a reproduction from honey.
31.9.4	Therefore, they do not proceed with honey.
31.9.5	Because it is exhausted.
31.9.6	They proceed with ghee.
31.9.7	Because this is the inexhaustible Prajapati's ghee.
31.9.8	The inexhaustible Prajapati is the gods.
31.9.9	He places it on the Garhapatya.
31.9.10	The wife looks at it.
31.9.11	This is the continuation of the sacrifice by the wife herself.
31.9.12	He thus places the pair at the mouth of the sacrifice for procreation.
31.9.13	Whatever the wife does at the sacrifice, that is the pair.
31.9.14	When the wife looks, she makes the pair.
31.9.15	This is impure, not fit for sacrifice, when the wife looks.
31.9.16	He places it on the Āhavanīya.
31.9.17	He makes it fit for sacrifice.
31.9.18	The gods and the Asuras were equal in the sacrifice.
31.9.19	Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did.
31.9.20	Indra saw this opportunity.
31.9.21	He looked at it.
31.9.22	With it he overcame the Asuras.
31.9.23	Then the gods became (victorious),
31.9.24	the Asuras became (defeated).
31.9.25	He who knows this, and looks at the clarified butter thus, becomes superior to his enemy. His enemy becomes inferior to him.
31.9.26	"He removes the Rakshas from the mouth of the sacrifice."
31.9.27	"He makes them sharp, destroyers of enemies."
31.9.28	He cleanses the ladles.
31.9.29	He indeed purifies them.
31.9.30	He first anoints the ladle.
31.9.31	He anoints the male first.
31.9.32	Then the Juhu, then the Upamant, then the Dhruva.
31.9.33	The Juhu is this (earth).
31.9.34	The Upamant is the sky.
31.9.35	This (earth) is the Dhruva (fixed).
31.9.36	He anoints these worlds in the proper order.
31.9.37	The Juhū is dedicated to the sacrificer.
31.9.38	The Upabṛt is dedicated to the enemy.
31.9.39	Taking four spoonfuls in the Juhu, one takes more ghee. Taking eight spoonfuls in the Upabṛti, one takes less.
31.9.40	He makes his enemy a target.
31.15.1	The Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices are indeed the established sacrifices.
31.15.2	Whose deities come to the sacrifice, and whose not? When many sacrificers perform on the same day,
31.15.3	Those deities come to the one who takes them on the previous day.
31.15.4	"One takes Agni first, saying, "May my radiance be in the contests!"
31.15.5	Agni is all the deities."
31.15.6	The deities themselves take it on the previous day.
31.15.7	They offer it on the next day.
31.15.8	At the full moon, they undertake the vow with grass, and at the new moon with calves.
31.15.9	Before the calves are released, the couple eats.
31.15.10	Having washed his hands, standing to the right of the fire, he should say:
31.15.11	"O Agni, lord of vows, I take the vow." Agni is the lord of vows.
31.15.12	The Brahman is the upholder of the vow.
31.15.13	Having addressed the lord of vows, he takes the vow.
31.15.14	His vow is accomplished.
31.15.15	If one takes the vow when the sun has set, having approached the fire, one should recite this mantra:
31.15.16-21	For he has entered the fire then. "He touches the vessel with the formula, "Agni is the Hotr, he invokes him." The deities are difficult to grasp. The sacrifice is difficult to grasp. Here he grasps both the deities and the sacrifice. "May the gods come here with good intentions." These are the invocations of the gods.
31.15.22	The gods go to his call.
31.15.23	He who knows this does not fall away from the sacrifice.
31.15.24	"May the gods enjoy my oblation and this (food)." He prays for a blessing.
31.15.25	"I yoke thee with divine Brahman," he says when the enclosing sticks are being placed around.
31.15.26	This is Agni's union.
31.15.27	He yokes Agni with Brahman.
31.15.28	He is yoked, he carries the oblation to the gods.
31.15.29	The Angirasas are yoked with the first sections of this sacrifice. This is the connection of the Sāmidhenī verses.
31.15.30	He obtains the blessing he desires of those who are yoked.
31.15.31	"Agni is kindled, offered." This is the kindling.
31.15.32	"You are the mind, belonging to Prajapati."
31.15.33-39	"May I enter with the mind, not with the body." The mind is indeed Prajapati. The sacrifice is Prajapati. He makes the sacrifice continue. His speech is Indra's, destroying enemies. "May I enter with speech, with the power of Indra." Speech is indeed power. He obtains power.
31.15.40	The Brahmanas do not know that. If the Brahmanas perform sacrifices in the spring, or if they perform sacrifices in the year of which they speak, then the sacrifice of him who speaks of that year goes to him, and does not go to the other.
31.15.41	One should speak of the best in the course of the offering.
31.15.42	The gods are the fathers, the fathers are the gods. He who am I, that am I, he offers. Whoever offers, whatever he is, that is his offering. It does not approach another.
31.15.43	He gives the sacrifice to the gods and fathers.
31.15.44	They protect him.
31.15.45	He goes to heaven with the fulfilled.
31.15.46	It becomes inexhaustible and limitless for him in the heavenly world.
31.15.47	"I delight the spring among the seasons."
31.15.48	There are five seasons.
31.15.49	He delights the seasons themselves.
31.15.50	They, being delighted, become favourable to him. The seasons become favourable to him who knows thus.
32.1.1	"The sacrifice with Agni and Soma as its eyes." Agni and Soma are the eyes of the sacrifice.
32.1.2	He places the eye of the sacrifice in himself.
32.1.3	He who knows this becomes one who has sight.
32.1.4	"Agni is the lord of food, the lord of food among the gods." Agni is the eater of food among the deities.
32.1.5	He makes him attain food among humans.
32.1.6	One becomes a food-giver who knows this.
32.1.7	May I be undaunted by him, may I conquer him by this very Dabbha. By this very Dabbhâ the gods conquered the Asuras.
32.1.8	By the same one he conquers his enemy.
32.1.9	He who knows this conquers him without being greedy.
32.1.10	Agni and Soma are the killers of Vritra. By the strength of Agni and Soma Indra killed Vritra.
32.1.11	By means of them alone he conquers his enemies.
32.1.12	"He says, "By means of Indra and Agni I may be endowed with strength and vigour," for Indra and Agni are strength and vigour.
32.1.13	He places strength and vigour in himself.
32.1.14	" "He says, "Through Indra I may be endowed by means of Indra I may be possessed of power," for Indra is power."
32.1.15	He places power in himself.
32.1.16	"May I go to the earth of Indra, the god of sacrifice, by means of the sacrifice to Indra." He indeed goes to the earth of the god of sacrifice.
32.1.17	"May I be without an enemy by means of the sacrificial offering to Indra, the destroyer of enemies." He indeed becomes without an enemy.
32.1.18	"May be a possessor of cattle by means of the offering to Indra, who is endowed with power." Cattle indeed are power.
32.1.19	He indeed places cattle in himself.
32.1.20	"May I prosper with the sacrifice to Sarasvati, the goddess of speech, food and drink." Sarasvati is speech.
32.1.21	One prospers with speech.
32.1.22	"May I prosper with sacrifice to Pusan, the god of prosperity, with prosperity and cattle." Pusan is prosperity.
32.1.23	One prospere with prosperity.
32.1.24	"May I attain stability through the worship of the gods of Aditi." This is Aditi.
32.1.25	One indeed attains stability in this very (Aditi).
32.1.26	"May I attain union with the vital airs of all the gods through the worship of all the gods." One indeed attains union with the vital breaths.
32.1.27	"By the sacrifice to the heaven and earth, may I beget offspring and cattle." He approaches Prajapati.
32.1.28	"By the sacrifice to Agni Sviṣṭakṛt, may I attain life and stability." He places life in himself.
32.1.29	He stands firm by the sacrifice, he who knows that the deities and the sacrifice are to be gratified in the sacrifice.
32.1.30	He is satisfied with offspring and cattle.
32.1.31	Soma-drink bows to him.
32.1.32	Now indeed all the deities are at the time of the Svishtakrit.
32.1.33	Now indeed he sacrifices to all of them.
32.1.34	This indeed is the visible sacrifice, namely the Svishtakrt.
32.1.35	"The deities are satisfied with the sacrifice."
32.1.36	He is satisfied with offspring and cattle.
32.1.37	Soma-drinking approaches him.
32.1.38	"He goes to Agni's dear abode."
32.1.39	He obtains brahminical splendour by that.
32.1.40	"He approaches Soma's dear abode"
32.1.41	He obtains nobility by that.
32.1.42	He approaches Agni-Soma's dear abode.
32.1.43	He approaches silently.
32.1.44	He obtains the undefined by that.
32.1.45	The Agni-Soma-s have come to their dear abode.
32.1.46	Loudly.
32.1.47	The meaning is explained by that.
32.1.48	This is both the Unnamed and the Named.
32.1.49	For the binding of both of them.
32.1.50	And also for the binding of the dry and the green.
32.1.51	What is dry, that is Agni's;
32.1.52	What is green, that is Soma's;
32.2.3	Vamadeva saw this name of the cow.
32.2.4	The cow is Ida.
32.2.5	He places animals in animals.
32.2.6	May I go to your favour, O favoured one.
32.2.7	May I partake of your favour, O invited one.
32.2.8	The sacrifice is twofold.
32.2.9	He seeks the blessing of the sacrifice.
32.2.10	Come, O well-wisher.
32.2.11	He makes her a well-wisher.
32.2.12	Together with prosperity.
32.2.13	He comes together with prosperity.
32.2.14	Indra may bestow power on us.
32.2.15	This is the milking of Ida.
32.2.16	He milks Ida.
32.2.17	May the wealthy ones be with us for prosperity.
32.2.18	The wealthy ones are cattle.
32.2.19	He places cattle within himself.
32.2.20	"May there be blessings for us." He prays for blessings.
32.2.21	"O Indra, I am conquering the fields with my thousand-fold strength, making the enemies below."
32.2.22	He makes his enemy inferior.
32.2.23	"Brahma, increase my brilliance."
32.2.24	"Ojas, increase my strength."
32.2.25	This is the same as saying, "May Ida yield everything."
32.2.26	All this becomes laughter for him who knows this.
32.2.27	"That great sense is in me."
32.2.28	The sense is indeed the waters.
32.2.29	He places the sense in himself.
32.2.30	"Expand, O Brāhmaṇas."
32.2.31	"May the directions be completed."
32.2.32	The sun indeed is the expanding one.
32.2.33	When he rises, then the directions are completed. He who knows this
32.2.34	The oblation which a non-Brahman eats is lost.
32.2.35	Vasishtha alone knew the expiation for it.
32.2.36	He touches the sacrificial cake with the formula, "O Brahman, swell."
32.2.37	He establishes the sacrifice in those who are worthy of receiving gifts.
32.2.38	It is not lost, not disturbed.
32.2.39	The oblation which a Brahman eats is indeed offered.
32.2.40	Then indeed did Kapivana Bauvaayana say:
32.2.41	"What is the use of sacrificing for one who does not milk the sacrifice like a cow?"
32.2.42	"This is the best milking of the cow."
32.2.43	The sacrificer eats the sacrificer's share, saying, "May the sacrificer be blessed."
32.2.44	The sacrificers are the sacrificer.
32.2.45	The sacrifice is the sacrificer' s share.
32.2.46	When the sacrificer eats the sacrifice's share,
32.2.47	He establishes the sacrifice in the sacrificial thread itself.
32.3.1	"May I be endowed with offspring by the sacrifice of the divine sacrificial grass."
32.3.2	By the sacrificial grass, indeed, Prajapati created offspring.
32.3.3	He creates offspring.
32.3.4	"May be endowed with cattle by the sacrifice of divine Narashansa."
32.3.5	By Narashansa, indeed, Prajapat created cattle.
32.3.6	He creates the animals.
32.3.7	"He says, "By the sacrifice to the divine Agni Svishtakrit, may I attain longevity and stability."
32.3.8	He bestows longevity upon himself.
32.3.9	He stands firm through the sacrifice.
32.3.10	"May the blessings be for those who desire to milk."
32.3.11	The blessings indeed are for those who desire milk, they stand near the sacrificer.
32.3.12	Just as milked cows go away, so do they go away from the sacrificer.
32.3.13	But he who knows this, he indeed milks the blessings.
32.3.14	"May my blessings go to the gods."
32.3.15	Having sent the blessings to the gods, he chooses a boon.
32.3.16	"From the loved one, to the more loved one."
32.3.17	He makes him go from the loved one to the more loved.
32.3.18-23	The Panna is the better than the Panna. He makes it better than the Panni itself. He says this: "May the mind go to the gods." He says this, "May he go to the gods by the path that goes to the gods." He makes him go by the path that leads to the gods. May Agni lead you to the deity with the red one.
32.3.24	"May Indra, with the two Haris, lead thee to the gods."
32.3.25	The Sacrificer is the kindling-wood.
32.3.26	He sends him to the world of heaven, having made him an offering.
32.3.27	"Go to the sacrifice, go to the sacrifice."
32.3.28	"Go to Yajnapatl."
32.3.29	He sends him back to his own place.
32.3.30	"He who knows the life of the sacrifice, attains all life."
32.3.31	"Thou art the life of the Sacrifice."
32.3.32	"May the sacrifice bestow life on me."
32.3.33	This is the life of the sacrifice.
32.3.34	He who knows this attains the whole life.
32.3.35	When one who is yoked is released, he either makes a peaceful chariot or goes astray.
32.3.36	"I release your halter, I release the reins."
32.3.37	This is his release.
32.3.38	Having sent the deity to heaven and having established it, he releases it.
32.3.39	The end of the sacrifice is the peace of Vishnu.
32.3.40	Vishnu is indeed the sacrifice.
32.3.41	He establishes the sacrifice at the very end.
32.4.1	The sacrifice is desired by the Bhrigus, the giver of wealth by the ascetics.
32.4.2	This is the milking of the sacrifice.
32.4.3	One milks the sacrifice.
32.4.4	May I obtain the wealth of that desired and well-desired sacrifice. He prays for a blessing.
32.4.5	The Angirasas have made my sacrifice prosper with the morning prayers. This is the milking of blessings.
32.4.6	The sacrifice is wealth, the sacrifice is wealthy. He makes the sacrifice wealthy.
32.4.7	May I obtain wealth from that sacrifice, from the wealthy sacrifice. He prays for blessings.
32.4.8	Soma is the bestower of semen.
32.4.9	Soma indeed is the bestower semen of the gods.
32.4.10	Soma indeed is the one who bestows semen, he bestows semen.
32.4.11	"Tvashtra, the creator of forms."
32.4.12	Tvashtra indeed is the creator of forms.
32.4.13	He creates forms for him.
32.4.14	The wives of the gods, Agni as the householder, the couple of the sacrificer.
32.4.15	This indeed is the couple of the new and full moon sacrifices.
32.4.16	At the Darsha-Purnamāsa sacrifices, he creates a pair of himself.
32.4.17	"He thinks, "By means of the Devatas' sacrifice, I shall beget offspring through a pair."
32.4.18	One is born with offspring and cattle.
32.4.19	If his wife were to sit behind him, Agni would burn her offspring.
32.4.20	He says, "This is your wife, this is your world." He makes it the world of him.
32.4.21	His fire does not burn. His progeny becomes.
32.4.22	"May the wife go with her husband to good deeds."
32.4.23	This is the wife's participation in the sacrifice.
32.4.24	They become together in the heavenly world.
32.4.25	"Svāhā! Svāhā! To the desired ones, Vasat! To the undesired ones."
32.4.26	Swishtakriti and Durishtakriti are united in the sacrifice.
32.4.27	He who is blessed by Swishtakriti becomes more prosperous.
32.4.28	He who has been cursed by Durishtakriti becomes worse.
32.4.29	He blesses his sacrifice with Swishtakriti.
32.4.30	He becomes more prosperous. "
32.4.31	"O Agni, may I be free from disease and free from censure."
32.4.32	The name of Agni is indeed "Aja".
32.4.33	They say that it is the boundary of the gods.
32.4.34	The expiation of the sacrifice that we know and that we do not know,
32.4.35	And what is done and what is not done in the sacrifice,
32.4.36	This is the expiation for both of them.
32.4.37	"Svāhā to Sarasvatī, the sister of Vesa."
32.4.38	This is indeed the consecration.
32.4.39	They even live on him.
32.4.40	"They say, "We worship the speech of this Brahman or this king."
32.4.41	He who knows this.
32.4.42	"He says, "I take you with the Gayatri, the Prama, the Abhimaya, the Unmaya, and the Pratima of the sacrifice."
32.4.43	The Gayatri is the Prama of the sacrifice.
32.4.44	The Tristubh is the Abhimaya.
32.4.45	The Jagati is the Unmaya.
32.4.46	The Anustubh is the Pratima.
32.4.47	These many metres carry the sacrifice.
32.4.48	He indeed encloses him with them.
32.4.49	He indeed establishes him in them.
34.1.1	They proceed with the eleven-fold (verses).
34.1.2	The eleven-fold (verse) is the vital airs.
34.1.3	They indeed proceed, having established themselves in the vital airs.
34.1.4	They say that if the days were to be eleven, the animals would be excessive or the best animal would not be accomplished on the last day.
34.1.5	If they desire eleven, they should perform the eleven-day sacrifice in the first and last months.
34.1.6	The eleven-day sacrifice is the vital breaths.
34.1.7	They obtain the vital breaths from the mouth.
34.1.8	They stand at the end in the vital airs.
34.1.9	The animal sacrifice to Indra-Agni is indeed unfailing.
34.1.10	Indra-Agni are the vital airs and out-breath.
34.1.11	They go to the vital airs and the out-breath, standing in them.
34.1.12	Indra and Agni are indeed brilliance.
34.1.13	They go standing in brilliance.
34.1.14	Indra Agni are indeed strength and valour.
34.1.15	They go to the power of Indra and Agni, the power of the gods.
34.1.16	Indra and Agni are all the gods.
34.1.17	When the animal is dedicated to Indra and Agni, they go to all the gods, pleasing them.
34.1.18	If the Rathantara Saman were to be sung on that day, then on that day they should offer an animal to Agni.
34.1.19	If the Brihat Saman were to sung on that day then on that day it would be dedicated to Indra. That day is indeed dedicated to Indra and Agnis.
34.1.20	If the Rathantara Sāman is to be chanted on that day, then they should offer a beast to Agni-Indra.
34.1.21	If the Brihat Sāman is chanted on that day then it is to Indra-Agni.
34.1.22	They arrange the deities in order.
34.1.23	They offer the animals in order.
34.1.24	One goes to Indra-Agniv
34.1.25	They should offer the Barhaspatya animal with a white back on the sixth day.
34.1.26	Brahma is indeed Brihaspati.
34.1.27	They thus establish themselves in Brahma, the end of the sacrifice.
34.1.28	The Barhaspatya is indeed the animal with a white-backed skin.
34.1.29	They should offer a cow to Dyava-Pritvi on the seventh day, in the first section of the Chandomas.
34.1.30	Heaven and earth are the foundation of the sacrifice.
34.1.31	They thus establish the sacrifice at the end on heaven and earth.
34.1.32	The cow is indeed heaven and earth as the deity.
34.1.33	They should offer a calf belonging to Vayu on the eighth day, in the middle of the Chandomas.
34.1.34	Vayu is indeed the breath.
34.1.35	They thus make the sacrifice stand at the end on breath.
34.1.36	The calf is indeed the deity of Vayu.
34.1.37	They should offer a spotted (cow) to speech in the ninth day, in the last Chandomas.
34.1.38	Speech is indeed the spotted one, the foundation.
34.1.39	They indeed find support at the end of the sacrifice in speech itself.
34.1.40	The spotted one is indeed the deity belonging to speech.
34.1.41	They should sacrifice a cow belonging to Aditi in the tenth day.
34.1.42	This is Aditi.
34.1.43	This is the foundation.
34.1.44	It is on this that the sacrifice finally rests.
34.1.45	The Adityas are indeed the deity of the Vasha (rite).
34.1.46	On the Mahavrata day, they should offer a bull to Vishvakarman.
34.1.47	Indra, having killed Vritra, became Vishvakarman;
34.1.48	Prajapati, having created beings, became Vishvakarma.
34.1.49	They say that the year is Visvakarman.
34.1.50	He from whom these creatures are born.
34.1.51	He should be three-formed, both ways.
34.1.52	The first form is Indra.
34.1.53	The second is Prajapati.
34.1.54	The third is the form of the year.
34.1.55	Indra is the bull.
34.1.56	Prajapati is the bull.
34.1.57	They say that the bull is his year.
34.1.58	He from whom these creatures are born.
34.1.59	Therefore, he should be a bull.
34.2.1	From him, having made the color of the sun, the splendor, the power, the strength, the offspring, and the cattle, depart.
34.2.2	He who has a sacrificial post growing is the lord, the sacrificer.
34.2.3	He becomes more sinful.
34.2.4	One should offer a sacrifice to Tvashtra, the multi-formed.
34.2.5	Tvashtra is the creator of forms.
34.2.6	One approaches him with a share in the sacrifice.
34.2.7	He again turns back for him brilliance, power, strength, offspring and cattle.
34.2.8	Those who have initiated die, they are afflicted.
34.2.9	If they were to reject him, their world would be like that of the cruel.
34.2.10	They should say, "Bring and burn."
34.2.11	Having placed him on the southern half of the altar, they should praise him with the verses of the Serpent Queen.
34.2.12	This is indeed the Serpent Queen. 
34.2.13	They fan him with her alone.
34.2.14	They say, "This is indeed a mistake, that one is praised without being praised in return."
34.2.15	The Hotṛ, having first taken the consecration, having put on the sacred thread, having gone round the Marjālīya (fire), reciting the Yāmis, reciting the verses of the Serpent-king,
34.2.16	This indeed is the Serpent-king.
34.2.17	They blow him over this very (fire).
34.2.18	They indeed blow him over.
34.2.19	And they also blow him down.
34.2.20	They are like darkness to those whose initiated ones die.
34.2.21	"Agni, do thou purify the life-forces."
34.2.22	They should perform this as the first step of Soma.
34.2.23	They again attain their own self.
34.2.24	They place life in themselves.
34.2.25	They go with light.
34.2.26	Those whose initiated ones die are unstable.
34.2.27	The Soma-pressing should be in the Rathantara tune.
34.2.28	This earth is the Rathantara.
34.2.29	They stand firm on this (earth).
34.3.1	If it is stolen, another should be bought.
34.3.2	If it is bought, the one who is nearest should be bought and then pressed.
34.3.3	The king should give something to the buyer.
34.3.4	By that he becomes bought.
34.3.5	If they do not find Soma, they should press the Pūtikas.
34.3.6	If they do not find Pūtikas, they should press Arjuna.
34.3.7	Gayatri stole Soma, becoming a hawk.
34.3.8	Its Soma-protector followed and cut off its claw.
34.3.9	Then the ray that was released became Pūtika.
34.3.10	These are called Pūtikas.
34.3.11	When they sprinkle the Utikas, they make the Utikas for the sacrifice.
34.3.12	Indra indeed slew Vritra.
34.3.13	His blood became the red wool.
34.3.14	And the juice that flowed from the strong necks became the brown wool.
34.3.15	Soma, indeed, is like the sun.
34.3.16	Therefore, there should be no pouring of Soma.
34.3.17	There should be a morning meal, and evening meal.
34.3.18	Curd at midday.
34.3.19	Evening meal and cooked food in the evening.
34.3.20	He who has his Soma stolen is deprived of the Soma-drink by Indra.
34.3.21	He enters into plants and animals.
34.3.22	When he drinks both of these, he obtains the Soma-drink from plants and animals.
34.4.1	If the two Somas were to be pressed together, one should perform the morning recitation of the Mahāvrata rite.
34.4.2	He takes the sacrifice, the deities, and the metres before (the others).
34.4.3	One should perform the Pratipada with the verse "May the two Somas be pressed together."
34.4.4-8	Indra is the bull. He thus wins Indra from the morning pressing. They say that it should be done at the beginning of the pressing. He thus gains Indra from the beginning of the morning pressing. For the lying down, for the sitting down, for the Gayatri metre, for the overlord, svāhā.
34.4.9-13	For the Sāman, for the Sāman-verse, for the Sāmāndhalas, for the Sämāndhalas-verse, for Sāman-chanting, for the Sâman-chanting-verse, for chanting, for the chanting-verse, for singing, for the singing-verse, for reciting, for the reciting-verse, for recitation, for the recitation-verse, for melody, for the melody-verse, for harmony, for the harmony-verse, for union, for the union-verse, for unison, for the unison-verse, for blending, for the blending-verse, for combination, for the combination-verse, for combining, for the combining-verse, for joining, for the joining-verse, for junction, for the junction-verse, for conjunction, for the conjunction-verse, for connection, for the connection-verse, for connexion, for the connexion-verse, for association, for the association-verse, for companionship, for the companionship-verse, for fellowship, for the fellowship-verse, for friendship, for the friendship-verse, for unity, for the unity-verse, for oneness, for the oneness-verse, for uniformity, for the uniformity-verse, for conformity, for the conformity-verse, for agreement, for the agreement-verse, for concord, for the concord-verse, for unanimity, for the unanimity-verse, for consensus, for the consensus-verse, for acquiescence, for the acquiescence-verse, for compliance, for the compliance-verse, for obedience, for the obedience-verse, for submission, for the submission-verse, for surrender, for the surrender-verse, for devotion, for the devotion-verse, for dedication,
34.4.14	This is the extent of what exists.
34.4.15	As much as there is in the sky, in the earth, in the day and night, from them he distributes them all.
34.4.16	If a pot breaks at the morning pressing, they should chant the verses to Visnu in the Madhyandin Pavamana at midday.
34.4.17	Whatever is in excess of the sacrifice, that is the excess of Vishnu.
34.4.18	This is the excess, the excess of Vishnu,
34.4.19	One obtains the excess by means of the excess.
34.4.20	If they were to perform the Vasat-ending Saman before the Pavamana of the midday pressing,
34.4.21	If it is at the third pressing, it is the same.
34.4.22	The Vasat-call is the foundation of the sacrifice.
34.4.23	They make him attain the foundation.
34.5.1	The Udgātṛ ascends the seat and sings with the Mahāvratas.
34.5.2	The Hotṛ ascends the Preṅkha and recites the great eulogy.
34.5.3	The Adhvaryus recite the Pratihara while standing on the Adhiṣṭhāna.
34.5.4	The others sit on the cushions.
34.5.5	The atmosphere is food.
34.5.6	It is given from there.
34.5.7	It is born in this (world).
34.5.8	It is born for the atmosphere.
34.5.9	Those who perform the Mahāvrata rite while seated in the atmosphere, for the attainment of food.
34.5.10	And they conquer the upper world by means of the divine witness.
34.5.11	Going to the heaven, they ascend.
34.5.12	The Abhigar and Apagar are performed.
34.5.13	One praises the sacrificers, another criticizes, he who praises.
34.5.14	Whatever is well-sung and well-praised by them, that he praises.
34.5.15	And he who criticizes, whatever is ill-sung and ill-praised by him, that he destroys.
34.5.16	The Śūdra and the Ārya compete in leather.
34.5.17	The gods and the Asuras competed in the sun.
34.5.18	The gods conquered him.
34.5.19	He recites the noble color.
34.5.20	He recitess himself.
34.5.21	The noble one would be inside the altar, the Shudra outside the altar.
34.5.22	The white skin would be round.
34.5.23	It is the form of the sun.
34.5.24	Drums sound in all directions.
34.5.25	They attain that direction with that.
34.5.26	The earth is the drum.
34.5.27	The speech that is in it, he wins by that.
34.5.28	They say the lute.
34.5.29	The speech which is in the animals, he wins by it.
34.5.30	They say a lute with a handle.
34.5.31	The speech in the plants, he wins by them.
34.5.32	They say an arrow-case.
34.5.33	The speech among the trees, he wins by him.
34.5.34	The arrow has a hundred strings.
34.5.35	Man has a life of a hundred years and a hundred powers.
34.5.36	He obtains life and power.
34.5.37	The celibate and the promiscuous one are the two who practice.
34.5.38	All beings speak with words.
34.5.39	They practice together.
34.5.40	They practice for a year.
34.5.41	Their procreation is hidden by the year.
34.5.42	The (women) who go in pairs, for the attainment of the procreation of the year.
34.5.43	They approach the Kumbinis for prosperity.
34.5.44	They go around singing this sweet song, wearing their armour.
34.5.45	They honour the Great Vrata itself.
34.5.46	And for Indra's supremacy.
34.5.47	Brahma's radiance is different from that of the Kshatriya.
34.5.48	The one who is consecrated, wearing the black antelope skin, is the radiance of Brahman.
34.5.49	The one who is armored and with a bow strung is the radiance of the Kshatriya.
34.5.50	Both of these become, for the securing of the radiance of both.
34.6.1	Prajapati, from himself, created the twelve-day (rite).
34.6.2	Prajapati is the year.
34.6.3-9	He took three nights for each of the four months. That became the initiation. He took three nights for the next four months. Those became the Upasads. He took the next three nights for the four months. That became the Sutyā. Therefore, they say, "The twelve-day sacrifice is as long as the year."
34.6.10	For this (universe) is created from the whole year.
34.6.11	He created the first day, the Iḍa and the Samā, this world, Agni, and Light.
34.6.12	He created a second day, the Iṭa and the Samanta, the world of the atmosphere, Vāyu, and Light. 
34.6.13	He created a third day, the Iṣṭa and the Sāma, that world, the Sun, and Light.
34.6.14	And he created the fourth day, and the Paristuthedam (hymn), and the Sama (hymn), in that world the light is the lustre.
34.6.15	And he created the fifth day, and the Adhyardhedam (hymns), and the Sama, in that world the truth is the light.
34.6.16	And he cre- ated the sixth day, and the Holidam (hymn) and the Sama, and in that world the Brahman is the light.
34.6.17	And the seventh day he created, and the Cheda hymn, and in that world the light of Tapas.
34.6.18	And the eighth day he created, the Visvagvid hymn, and in the world the light of truth.
34.6.19	And the ninth day he created, Hoita hymn, and in this world the light of Brahman.
34.6.20	And he created the tenth day, and the Dvida (Sāman), in that world where there is immortality and light.
34.6.21	The Prāṇīya (Sāman) is indeed the Prāṇa, and the Udayaniya is the Apāna.
34.6.22	Therefore, whatever is done in the Prāṇīyīya, the same is done in the Udayaniyīya.
34.6.23	For as much as is the Prāṇa so much is the Apāna.
34.6.24	He who, knowing this, performs the twelve-day sacrifice, wins these worlds, these regions, these luminaries, these lights.
34.7.1	Prajapati desired, 'Let me create beings.'
34.7.2	He saw this twelve-day sacrifice within himself.
34.7.3	He fashioned it from himself.
34.7.4	With it he created beings.
34.7.5-10	The metre Gayatri was created for him. She desired, "May I conquer this (universe) from all sides." She conquered him from the front with brilliance, from the middle with strength, from above with the metre. She conquered him on all sides. He who knows this conquers his enemy on all sides. The two forms of the year are the months and the seasons.
34.7.11	By the six seasons he has attained it.
34.7.12	By the twelve months he has attained it
34.7.13	He attains the year by both forms.
34.7.14	Brahma is indeed the Gayatri.
34.7.15	The twelve-day ritual is the Kshatra.
34.7.16	The Kshatra recognizes him.
34.7.17	He who knows this attains the Purodha.
34.7.18	The other metres were created from the sacrifice.
34.7.19	The Brihatī was created from the kingdom of heaven.
34.7.20	Therefore, they do not recite the Vasat at the Brihatī.
34.7.21	If they were to recite the Vasat, they would offer the animals into the fire.
34.7.22	By reciting the Vasat, one obtains animals.
34.7.23	The four animals are in speech: a cow, a horse, a goat and a sheep.
34.7.24	Therefore, animals are invoked by speech and come forth.
34.7.25	They return when accomplished by speech.
34.7.26	Those who spend these nights attain the Brihatī.
34.7.27	These nights are thirty-six.
34.7.28	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
34.7.29	The Brihātī leads to heaven.
34.7.30-37	Those who spend these nights attain the world of heaven. Those who spend these nights indeed attain the world of the gods. These are thirty-six nights. There are thirty-six worlds of the gods. There are eight Vasus, eleven Rudras, twelve Adityas, the Vasat-call and Prajapati.
34.7.38	These are the three worlds.
34.7.39	Those who spend these nights attain all those worlds of the gods.
34.7.40	Both gods and men were not excluded.
34.7.41	The gods performed this twelve-day sacrifice.
34.7.42	They restored themselves with initiation.
34.7.43	They completed the sacrifice with the Upasads.
34.7.44	Having abandoned the body, they went to the heavenly world through the Suti.
34.7.45	One who knows this, and performs the twelve-day sacrifice, purifies himself by the consecration, and prepares the sacrifice by the Upasads. Having abandoned the body, he goes to the heavenly world by means of the Sutya.
34.7.46	Prajapati brought this (sacrifice) for one desiring heaven.
34.7.47	It did not succeed.
34.7.48	This is indeed an eleven-day (sacrifice).
34.7.49	He placed this Atiratra above it on both sides.
34.7.50	This is the same as the other, both of which are avoided for the sake of attaining heaven.
34.8.1	Prajapati desired, 'May I beget offspring.'
34.8.2	He performed the twelve-day sacrifice.
34.8.3	Through that he begot offspring.
34.8.4	One who knows this indeed begets offspring.
34.8.5	Indeed, when the waters that were fit for sacrifice and worthy of oblations were created, they were not created as one.
34.8.6	Indeed, blood was not created as one.
34.8.7	That is why it is called "blood".
34.8.8	Therefore, when blood is cut, one becomes fit for sacrifice.
34.8.9	One who accepts a sacrificial fee is equal to a man.
34.8.10	He eats a man.
34.8.11	One who eats a man does not have a name in this world or the next.
34.8.12	The Prāṇa Atiratra is the earlier one, and the Apāna Atiratra is later.
34.8.13-17	This is the former Atiratra, that is the latter. Agni is the former Agniṣṭoma, Surya is the latter. The two are intermediate. Therefore they are employed in between. They say, "Since the sacrifice is directed towards the Agniṣṭoma (Sūkta), why are the two Atiratras employed first?"
34.8.18	Now they say, the two Atirātras are the eyes of the sacrifice, the Agniṣṭomas are the pupils.
34.8.19	If one were to employ the two Agniṣṭomas first, one would place the pupils outside, and the offspring would be blind.
34.8.20	If one employs the two Atirătras first,
34.8.21	one places the eyes of the sacrificer in the middle, and the pupils in between.
34.8.22	The former Atiratra is the past, the latter is the future.
34.8.23	These ten days in the middle are the truth.
34.8.24	He becomes true who knows this.
34.8.25	He who knows the Gāyatrī with the luminous wings goes to heaven with luminous light.
34.8.26	The two Atiratras are the two wings.
34.8.27	The two Agnistomas are the two lights.
34.8.28	The eight Antarā Ukthyas are the Self.
34.8.29	This indeed is the Gāyatrī with luminous wings.
34.8.30	He who knows thus the Gāyatrī with luminous wings, goes to heaven with luminous radiance.
34.8.31	They indeed become birds.
34.8.32	Having become birds, they go wherever they desire.
34.8.33	This indeed is Prajapati, divided into twelve parts, in the twelve-day (rite).
34.8.34	The two Atirātras are the two wings.
34.8.35	Those who are the Agniṣṭoma and Ukthya are his eyes.
34.8.36	Those who are the eight Antar-Ukthyas are his Self.
34.8.37	He is indeed Prajapati himself.
34.8.38	The Satrins attain the true (Self).
34.8.39	That is the true nature of the Sattra.
34.8.40	The breath is indeed the true (Self);
34.8.41	They attain the breath.
34.8.42	Those who sit in the Sattra sit on the breath of all beings.
34.8.43	Therefore they ask, "Are these the sacrificers?"
34.8.44	He who knows this becomes dear to the people.
34.9.1	Prajapati desired, "Let me be."
34.9.2	He performed the twelve-day sacrifice.
34.9.3	By that he became.
34.9.4	Therefore they say, "The sacrifice for one who desires to be."
34.9.5	The initiated Prajapati was sacrificed by the uninitiated.
34.9.6	Therefore, those who are not initiated perform the initiation for those who are initiated.
34.9.7	He gave them food and strength.
34.9.8	This (earth) prospered in the months, given by Prajapati.
34.9.9	The months prospered, having accepted (the gift).
34.9.10	He prospers who, knowing this, gives (gifts).
34.9.11	He prosperes who receives (gifts).
34.9.12	One should initiate in the month of Piva.
34.9.13	Whatever is measured of its limbs, that he offers.
34.9.14	Just as the spring, with its fresh grass, shines forth, so does the fresh grass shine forth.
34.9.15	Tapas is the essence of the sacrifice.
34.9.16	Just as a chariot's essence, so is tapas the essence of the sacrificial rite.
34.9.17	He who is not ascetic, who is not united with it, his sacrifice is not united.
34.9.18	He becomes an ascetic.
34.9.19	He unites the sacrifice.
34.9.20	The months are the seasons.
34.9.21	They desired, "Let us be months."
34.9.22	They approached the twelve-day (rite).
34.9.23	Having made the thirteenth the Brahman, they stood up, seeing it.
34.9.24	Therefore he lives on others, not having a home.
34.9.25-30	Therefore, there should be no Brahmanical rite on the thirteenth day of the twelve-day ritual. Twelve should be initiated for the year-long ritual. Twelve months make a year. Those who are initiated for the year attain success. Thirteen should be initiated for a year-long ritual.
34.9.31-37	They prosper for a year. They should be initiated for fifteen days, for the duration of half a year. There are fifteen nights in half a year. They prosper for half a year.  They should be consecrated for seventeen days, for the period of Prajapati. Prajapati is seventeen. They prosper for the period of prajapati.
34.9.38-45	Twenty-one should be initiated for the sake of light. The sun is twenty-one. He is the giver of light. He bestows light on them. Twenty-four should be initiated for those who desire brahmic glory. The Gayatri has twenty-four syllables. The Gaytri is brilliance, brahmic glory. They attain brilliance and brahmic glory.
34.9.46	Twenty-seven should be initiated, having twenty-nine as their abode.
34.9.47	These worlds are twenty-nine.
34.9.48	They prosper having twenty-nine for their abode.
34.9.49	Thirty should be initiated, with the months as their abode. The months are thirty.
34.9.50	The nights are thirty.
34.9.51	They prosper with the months as abode.
34.9.52	Thirty-three should be initiated, the gods as their abode.
34.9.53	The thirty-three gods.
34.9.54	The gods themselves prosper.
34.9.55	Forty-four should be initiated, those who desire strength and power.
34.9.56	The Tristubh has forty-four syllables.
34.9.57	Strength and power are the Tristubh.
34.9.58	They obtain strength and power. 
34.9.59	Forty-eight should be initiated, desiring cattle.
34.9.60	The Jagati has forty-eight syllables.
34.9.61	The animals are the Jagatis.
34.9.62	They indeed obtain the animals.
34.9.63	They should be initiated without limit, for the obtaining of the unlimited.
34.9.64	Prajapati is unlimited.
34.9.65	They indeed attain Prajapati.
34.9.66	The seasons were the superiors, the months were the inferiors.
34.9.67	Those months desired, "May we attain the seasons."
34.9.68	They performed the twelve-day sacrifice.
34.9.69	Having made the thirteenth day the Brahman, they made the seasons shine with the cold and the spring stood up for them as the source of nourishment.
34.9.70	He who, knowing this, initiates in the cold, makes his enemy shine with austerity and stands up for himself as the source of sustenance.
34.9.71	The cold is his departure.
34.9.72	Spring is the end.
34.9.73	One who knows this, and performs the consecration in the winter, prospers.
34.10.1	Brahmin scholars say: What is obtained by the first day of the twelve-day ritual?
34.10.2	Brahma-splendour, brilliance.
34.10.3	What is obtained by the second day?
34.10.4	Speech, food.
34.10.5	What is gained by the third day?
34.10.6	These three worlds.
34.10.7	And what is the fourth?
34.10.8	The four-footed animals.
34.10.9	And what is the fifth?
34.10.10	The four directions.
34.10.11	The fifth is the upward direction.
34.10.12	And what the sixth?
34.10.13	The six seasons.
34.10.14	And what seventh?
34.10.15	The seven-footed Sakvari.
34.10.16	And what eighth?
34.10.17	The eight-syllabled Gayatri.
34.10.18	And what ninth?
34.10.19	Nine breaths.
34.10.20	What is the purpose of the tenth?
34.10.21	The ten-syllabled Viraj.
34.10.22	What is for the eleventh?
34.10.23	The eleven-syllabled Tristubh.
34.10.24	What is it for the twelfth?
34.10.25	The twelve-syllabled Jagati.
34.10.26	This much indeed exists.
34.10.27	Having obtained all that exists, he seizes it.
34.10.28	He who, knowing this, performs the twelve-day sacrifice, prospers and becomes more prosperous.
34.11.1	There are four of them, three of them, three.
34.11.2	Of them, the first ones purify one's self.
34.11.3	The second ones are fit for sacrifice, by them one becomes fit for sacrifice.
34.11.4	The third ones are the limbs, by them one is cleansed.
34.11.5	Then those (cows) which are the fourth, they shake off whatever impurity there is within it and outside it.
34.11.6	Indeed, they eat the man for whom they perform the twelve-day sacrifice.
34.11.7	He who eats the flesh of a sheep eats him.
34.11.8	He who drinks the blood of a horse eats him.
34.11.9	The one who eats the bones eats him.
34.11.10	One who eats ghee eats his marrow.
34.11.11	He who eats the parivāpa is the hair.
34.11.12	He who eats the purōḍāśa is the brain.
34.11.13	He who devours the king is the sweat.
34.11.14	He who drinks the liquor is the excrement.
34.11.15	He who speaks untruth eats the Sattrīya.
34.11.16	His Sattrīya is well-cooked, and his Sattrīya does not get digested, he who knows thus.
34.12.1	He becomes initiated for twelve years.
34.12.2	It is indeed born.
34.12.3	That which is born from Tapas is born.
34.12.4	He does not become initiated for twelve years with a woman.
34.12.5	Twelve impure things are in a man.
34.12.6-11	Hair, skin, blood, flesh, bones, marrow, spleen, tears, mucus, sweat, and urine are the twelve impure things in a man. These are the twelve impure substances in a man. When one becomes initiated, one becomes twelve. One removes them. One becomes twelve when initiated. There are twelve Upasads.
34.12.12	Twelve are produced.
34.12.13	They become thirty-six.
34.12.14	The Brihatī has thirty-six syllables.
34.12.15	Cattle are related to the Brihatī.
34.12.16	Herein he obtains cattle in the Brihatī,
34.12.17	and having obtained cattle in the Brihati, he secures them.
34.12.18	Then the four syllables that go out are the Catuṣpadas Anuṣṭup.
34.13.4-11	He succeeded. Therefore one should offer sacrifice for twelve days. For one alone succeeded, namely Prajapati. He who, knowing this, offers sacrifice for twelve days succeeds in the share of Prajapati. The three deities, namely Rocana, initiated themselves. They offered sacrifice. They succeeded. Therefore three should offer sacrifice for twleve days.
34.13.12	For they succeeded in these worlds alone.
34.13.13	Those who know this, and perform the twelve-day sacrifice, succeed in the prosperity of these worlds.
34.13.14	Six deities were initiated by that (rite).
34.13.15	They performed the sacrifice by that (rite),
34.13.16	and they succeeded.
34.13.17	Therefore one should perform the twelve-days sacrifice.
34.13.18	The six seasons indeed prospered.
34.13.19	Those who know this, and perform the twelve-day sacrifice, prosper like the seasons.
34.13.20	The twelve deities initiated themselves with that (sacrifice).
34.13.21	They performed the sacrifice with that (sacrifice),
34.13.22	and they prospered.
34.13.23	They prospered in the bright fortnights.
34.13.24	They did not call out to the dark fortnights.
34.13.25	Therefore, they should perform the sacrifice for twelve days.
34.13.26	For they succeeded in twelve months.
34.13.27	Those who know this and perform the sacrifice for twenty-four days succeed in half of the months.
34.13.28	One should initiate on the thirteenth day during the Upavasatha.
34.13.29	For they know him.
34.13.30	And they do not know him.
34.13.31	For they do know the thirteenth month.
34.13.32	They do not know.
34.17.1	Just as a chariot, going to each wheel, goes to the sacrifice, going to each form, goes to the Hotr.
34.17.2	The Hotr should be performed before the Pracārin.
34.17.3	This is what Vasishtha Satyahvya said.
34.17.4	When he says, "Do not let the Soma be spilled," he says, "Let us proceed, tomorrow I will establish the Soma."
34.17.5	The Soma of him who knows this does not spill.
34.17.6	He indeed drinks Soma by churning it with flour while seated on a stool.
34.17.7	"I indeed know the sacrifice from all sides."
34.17.8	"He who knows this will not harm me."
34.17.9	Soma, drunk or yet to be drunk, does not harm him who, knowing this, drinks Soma.
34.17.10	They used to ask him, "Why do you drink Soma after churning it with flour while seated?"
34.17.11	He replied, "I am establishing the sacrifice in the deities.
34.17.12	He who knows thus, and he who knows thus, offers the oblation for the sake of the Yajna, he establishes the Yajna in the deities.
34.17.13	One should offer the oblation for Yajna-distress for the sake of having a womb.
34.17.14	There are thirty-three parts of the Yajña.
34.17.15	There are one hundred and thirty-one Stoma Bhagas, three Savanas, and the Yajna is the fourth.
34.17.16	By the Stoma-parts he connects the Stoma-part, by the Savanas the Savanas, by the sacrifice the sacrifice.
34.17.17	All the limbs of his sacrifice are employed, all are attained, all are bound.
34.17.18	In the impulse of the divine Savitar, to Brihaspati be praise.
34.17.19	Whatever Savitar bestowed on the gods, thereby they prospered.
34.17.20	They praise him who is bestowed by Savitar.
34.17.21	They prosper.
34.17.22	The Stotras of him who knows thus, the sacrifice prospers, the sacrificer prospers, his offspring prospers, his cattle prosper, his Brahman prospers, for him who knows thus and for him who knows this, the Brahman prospers.
34.18.1	He who knows the extended and contracted parts of the Stoma Bhaga, he would be the Brahma of the Soma-sacrifice.
34.18.2	When the Bahispavamana is being chanted, he should say:
34.18.3	"The praise of the Stuta, the praise of the Urja, the praise of Dev Savitar, the praise of Brihaspati."
34.18.4	These are the extended and contracted forms of the Stoma Bhas.
34.18.5	He who knows this would be the Brahma at the Soma-sacrifice.
34.18.6	He should examine the direction in which Soma is being pressed.
34.18.7	"He should say, "I am afflicting so-and-so, the son of so-and-such, with grief."
34.18.8	He should tell one of the priests.
34.18.9	He afflicts them with grief.
34.18.10	He who is ignorant of the extended and retracted Stoma Bhagas, and becomes the Brahman, is afflicted by all kinds of energy.
34.18.11	When the Bahispavamāna is being chanted,
34.18.12	Having praised Savitar, the god, at the impulse of Savitar, the one generated by Brihaspati,
34.18.13	One should recite the Brāhmaṇas above and above.
34.18.14	One makes the hater inferior.
34.18.15	"Brahman, Soma has generated."
34.18.16	He says this, "The sacrifice has generated."
34.18.17	Where it would have fallen, one should pour water.
34.18.18	"The god Savitar, who was worshipped in the past, is now not to be praised by men at dawn."
34.18.19	"He who bestows the best treasures on humans, may he bestow wealth on us here."
34.18.20	One should recite this.
34.18.21	"Water is indeed all the deities."
34.18.22	"One establishes the sacrifice in the deities."
34.18.23	Where the Brahman sees that more is being given to someone else, that Soma becomes inferior and inferior.
34.18.24	If the Brahman sees that something more is being given away to someone else,
34.18.25	he should say to the sacrificer, "I am taking away the strength and energy of so-and-so, son of so-and so."
34.18.26	He takes away his strength and energy.
35.16.1	The Soma-cup which is placed in the Drona-vessel, the breath of him whose cup is being placed in the Dronakasha, does not enter.
35.16.2	For the Soma is the breath.
35.16.3	They say, one should pour down the milk.
35.16.4	But they also say, the milk is as if hidden.
35.16.5	One should pour down water over gold.
35.16.6	One should offer gold.
35.16.7	Water is nectar.
35.16.8	Gold is life.
35.16.9	He places life in himself from nectar.
35.16.10	Four boons are to be given to the Brahman, the Udgātṛ, the Hotṛ, and the Adhvaryu.
35.16.11	These indeed are the Indras of the sacrifice.
35.16.12	He pleases them.
35.16.13	That itself is the atonement there.
35.16.14	When the Soma is being poured into the cup, the Prāṇa follows the cup and pours into it.
35.16.15	For Soma is Prāṇa.
35.16.16	If the Adhvaryu were to take the last cup, he should pour the Soma into it.
35.16.17	Soma is taken for expiation.
35.16.18	He makes expiation for him.
35.16.19	He attains the whole span of life.
35.16.20	That is the atonement there.
35.16.21	If a stone is broken or an animal is injured,
35.16.22	Animals are stones.
35.16.23	They should chant with the Brahma-sāman for Dyutāna Maruta.
35.16.24	Animals are Dyutāna Marut.
35.16.25	He unites him with his own Sāman.
35.16.26	One becomes possessed of animals.
35.16.27	That is the atonement there.
35.16.28	He should offer the leftovers in the Uparava cups with the formula, "To Prajapati svāhā."
35.16.29	Soma belongs to Prajapati.
35.16.30	He makes him attain stability.
35.16.31	That itself is the atonement there.
35.16.32	If Soma is burnt, the Adhvaryu should offer the Grahas, the Udgātṛ should offer the Stotras, and the Hotṛ should offer the Sastras.
35.16.33	Then they should proceed with the sacrifice as before.
35.16.34	Five boons are to be given.
35.16.35	The sacrifice is performed by five.
35.16.36	One attains the sacrifice.
35.16.37	Having gone to Avabhrtha, one should again be initiated before the twelfth day.
35.16.38	If one goes beyond the twelfth day, one would be lost.
35.16.39	There one should give the same Dakshina as was to be given earlier.
35.16.40	That itself is the atonement there.
35.17.1	He who, having installed the fire, undertakes the vow, he directs all his desires into the fire.
35.17.2	If he were to depart without performing the sacrifice, the desires would not follow him, being displeased, and he would be lustreless and powerless.
35.17.3	He should offer while departing.
35.17.4	To you, O Angiras, all the worlds, the well-established ones, separately.
35.17.5	"O Agni, for the desire of the one who is here."
35.17.6	He indeed places desires in him.
35.17.7	The desires are pleased with him and follow him.
35.17.8	He becomes lustrous and vigorous.
35.17.9	This is the continuity of the sacrifice, when one having set up the fire, undertakes the vow.
35.17.10	If he were to go away without having performed the sacrifice, it would be a break in his continuity.
35.17.11	Having taken up the Praṇīta vessel, one should recite the Upavasatha verse.
35.17.12	Prajapati is indeed like the mind.
35.17.13	The sacrifice is related to Prajapati.
35.17.14	One indeed extends the sacrifice.
35.17.15	One should recite the verse "Bhūr."
35.17.16	Prajapati indeed is Bhūr.
35.17.17	One indeed attains prosperity.
35.17.18	If the fire of one whose fire has been extinguished goes out, one is deprived of life and strength.
35.17.19	If he were to be separated from the fire by the length of a bamboo, he should collect it.
35.17.20	This one is yours, that one is mine. Enter into the third light.
35.17.21	Enter into your body, be beautiful, dear to the gods, in the highest birthplace.
35.17.22	He collects it with Brahman itself.
35.17.23	That itself is the atonement there.
35.17.24	If the cow should go beyond, he should follow her and stay there.
35.17.25	That itself is the atonement.
35.17.26	If the calves of cows whose milk has been set aside for the oblation drink, the milk of those plants enters them.
35.17.27	One should offer a barley gruel to Vayu.
35.17.28	Vayu is the bestower of milk.
35.17.29	One approaches him with his own share.
35.17.30	He gives him milk.
35.17.31	Then he should lead the calves away for the next oblation.
35.17.32	That itself is the atonement.
35.18.1	Half of this sacrifice is lost if the milk offered in the evening is spoiled.
35.18.2	One should offer cooked rice to Indra and observe fast.
35.18.3	Plants are milk.
35.18.4	One observes fast with milk.
35.18.5	Whatever is to be done in the morning, they should do it at night.
35.18.6	The other cake should be Indra's.
35.18.7	Milk is the plants.
35.18.8	He makes him give milk to him with milk.
35.18.9	Or he should turn the calves away from the northern oblation.
35.18.10	That itself is the atonement there.
35.18.11	He indeed, by means of the oblation, pleases both the gods, those who come to the house of the sacrificer in the evening and morning, and those who are afflicted by the oblation milked in the evening and in the morning.
35.18.12	One should offer a rice-cake on five potsherds.
35.18.13	One should first worship Agni, the deity of the gods.
35.18.14	He indeed pleases the gods with Agni as the leader.
35.18.15	The other deities follow Agni.
35.18.16	The other deities follow Indra.
35.18.17	He thus propitiates both of them.
35.18.18	Or he should lead the calves away for the subsequent oblation.
35.18.19	That itself is the atonement there.
35.18.20	If one were to offer on a place infested with insects, the sacrificer would be without offspring and cattle.
35.18.21	If one would lead it to an improper place, it would be improper.
35.18.22	With the middle leaf, one should offer the oblation to Dyāvāpṛthivi within the enclosing sticks.
35.18.23	The heaven and earth are the foundation of the sacrifice.
35.18.24	He indeed makes him attain the foundation.
35.18.25	That itself is the atonement there.
35.18.26	If the embers were to fall towards the east when the Prajās are not offered, it would be a fault for the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer.
35.18.27	Whatever is the Dakshina for the Brahman and the sacrificer, that should be given.
35.18.28	Whatever is the Dakshine for the Hotri and the wife, that should be done.
35.18.29	Whatever is given to the Agnidhra and the sacrificer's animals, that should be offered.
35.18.30	One should strike it.
35.18.31	The thousand-horned bull, the knower of beings, the Stoma-backed, the ghee-possessed, the well-praised,
35.18.32	"Do not let me be deprived of you, O Lord, do not let me be bereft of you, O Thousand-feeder, and of the cow-feeder."
35.18.33	He strikes him with Brahma alone.
35.18.34	That itself is the atonement there.
35.18.35	Half of this sacrifice is performed for him whose wife does not eat on the Vratya day.
35.18.36	One should offer sacrifice after covering her.
35.18.37	One performs the sacrifice with the entire sacrifice.
35.18.38	Having worshipped her, one should invoke her.
35.18.39	"You are that, I am that, I am this."
35.18.40	"Come, let us unite for the sake of the man, for the son, for the purpose of creation."
35.18.41	"For prosperity, for nourishment, for good offspring, for good strength."
35.18.42	One should share her only half.
35.18.43	That itself is the atonement there.
35.19.1	If one were to offer with unploughed grain, one's own body would become ugly.
35.19.2	If he were to offer it, he would become worse.
35.19.3	If he were not to offer it, misfortune would befall him.
35.19.4	Mitra torments the people, knowing them. Mitra supports the earth and the sky.
35.19.5	Mitra sees the fields with unblinking eyes. They offer Mitra oblations with ghee.
35.19.6	Having placed the kindling wood, one should offer the oblation.
35.19.7	Mitra is the peace of the sacrifice.
35.19.8	He pacifies him with Mitra.
35.19.9	Having offered that, having offered another, one should offer again.
35.19.10	That itself is the atonement there.
35.19.11	If one were to offer with a pot that has been damaged by insects, the sacrificer would be without offspring and without cattle.
35.19.12	If one does not offer, one would incur misfortune.
35.19.13	One should offer the Valmīka-vessel with the Prajapati-verse.
35.19.14	Prajapati is the anthill.
35.19.15	Prajapata is the sacrifice.
35.19.16	One establishes the sacrifice in the sacrifice.
35.19.17	Having offered that, one should offer again after milking another (cow).
35.19.18	That itself is the atonement there.
35.19.19	If the second oblation is offered before the first one, the sacrificer would be deprived of animals with two legs.
35.19.20	If he offers the second oblation after the first one, he would be deprived of four-legged animals.
35.19.21	O Vanaspati, where do you know the secret names of the gods?
35.19.22	There, please lead the offerings."
35.19.23	Having placed the kindling wood with the Vānaspatya verse, one should offer.
35.19.24	By means of the Vānaspati verse, he offers oblations to the afflicted and the unafflicted.
35.19.25	Having offered that, having milked another, one should offer again.
35.19.26	That itself is the atonement there.
35.20.1	The gods and the Asuras were in this world.
35.20.2	Prajapati desired, "May I drive away the Asuras and create offspring."
35.20.3	He saw these four-monthly sacrifices.
35.20.4	He drove away the Asuras with the four-monthly sacrifices alone.
35.20.5	He created offspring with the four-month sacrifices.
35.20.6	He who, knowing this, performs the four-monthly sacrifice, drives away his enemies, and prospers in offspring and cattle.
35.20.7	Having created the sacrifice of Visvadev from the Agniṣṭoma, Prajapati created the creatures.
35.20.8	Having created the sacrifice of Varuna-prastha from the Ukthya, he bound the creatures with Varuna.
35.20.9	Having created a sacrifice of Sākamedha from the Atiratra, Indra killed Vritra.
35.20.10	By the Visvadev sacrifice, he drove away the Asuras.
35.20.11	By the Vaishvadev (rite) he created offspring.
35.20.12	Some offspring were created, others were not created.
35.20.13	Then Prajapati desired, 'Let me create offspring.'
35.20.14	The sacrifice is indeed the year.
35.20.15	The sacrifice is Prajapati.
35.20.16	He created these two, the Dhaniya and the Vadhrya, from himself.
35.20.17	Then he offered these oblations to these deities.
35.20.18	By them he created beings.
35.20.19	Beings were born from the seasons.
35.20.20	The five oblations are for the seasons.
35.20.21	For there are five seasons.
35.20.22	From that he is born.
35.20.23	Agni alone caused the flow.
35.20.24	Soma deposited the semen.
35.20.25	Agni and Soma are the pair.
35.20.26	Savitar is the bestower of offspring.
35.20.27	Savitar indeed is the year.
35.20.28	The year has twelve months.
35.20.29	Therefore (the cake) is on twelve potsherds.
35.20.30	And also because it is for the sake of being for all gods, it is on twelve potshers.
35.20.31	He offers in a low voice.
35.20.32	For the year is not defined.
35.20.33	When Sarasvati had created speech, she placed it in the year.
35.20.34	They have generated Pusan, the support.
35.20.35	Speech is Sarasvati.
35.20.36	Cattle is Pusan.
35.20.37	Speech and cattle are a pair.
35.20.38	From the middle, indeed, offspring are released.
35.20.39	From the end of the pair, offspring are born in the middle.
35.20.40	This is indeed the middle of Prajapati, from where offspring are released.
35.20.41	Then from the two pairs at the end, the two opposite sides are produced.
35.20.42	These are the oblations for Indra, the slayer of Vritra.
35.20.43	Indra slew Vritra with Agni's army, with Soma, the king, with Savitr, with Sarasvati, with the spring.
35.20.44	Pusha followed with his valour.
35.20.45	These are oblations for victory.
36.1.1	When Indra killed Vritra, his power and strength fled.
36.1.2	It entered all this, the waters, plants, and trees.
36.1.3	The gods became exhausted.
36.1.4	They brought this together.
36.1.5	What is called "Sannāyya" is the union of curd and milk.
36.1.6	The embryo, as it were, saw the world, as if it were a circle, as if it had been born.
36.1.7	From Tapas indeed are beings born.
36.1.8	It goes to the state of being heated, which is Tapas.
36.1.9	From that it is born.
36.1.10	When he created beings with the Vaisvadevamāṃsa, therefore these beings are Vaisvadevī.
36.1.11	The Viśve Devas are the young ones.
36.1.12	He offers to them alone.
36.1.13	For from the gift of them the creatures live.
36.1.14	This is the womb of creatures.
36.1.15	The Maruts desired it.
36.1.16	They were born with the grasp of anger.
36.1.17	Because they were born with the grasping of anger, for the sake of their own release.
36.1.18	The Marut are cattle.
36.1.19	This is for the propagation of cattle.
36.1.20	It is made of seven potsherds.
36.1.21	For the Maruts are seven.
36.1.22	The Maruts are indeed without a leader.
36.1.23	But by this (offering) he wins the food of the village.
36.1.24	They were created by the Visvedevī (offering), and they went astray.
36.1.25	They were taken in by the Dyāvāpṛthivi (offering).
36.1.26	It is for the protection of the created beings.
36.1.27-34	The one-pot offering is dedicated to Prajapati. He thus establishes himself in the deity Prajapati. The one-pot is the sacrificer. The Ahavaniya is the heavenly world. He offers the entire oblation. He thus sends him to the heavenly world, which has become the oblation. The one- pot is the self. The animals are ghee.
36.1.35-41	When he fills it with ghee, he makes it prosper with cattle. If he were to fill it, the cattle would stand by him without eating. For he makes it inferior to the cattle. It should be done with the back turned towards the north. He makes it superior to the cattle. The cattle stand by him eating. That is not to be guarded.
36.1.42	He should fill it up with water.
36.1.43	For cattle do not eat (grass) without water.
36.1.44	He makes it (the altar) with grass for the sake of stability.
36.1.45	When the sacrificer is destroyed, his progeny is destroyed.
36.1.46	When the sacrifice is established, his progeny is established.
36.1.47	The Hotr should be established in a straight line for the sake of the establishment of the sacrificer.
36.2.1	The grass is arranged in three rows.
36.2.2	The sacrificial grass is tied in three ways.
36.2.3	The seasons are divided into three parts.
36.2.4	One should offer in spring for reproduction.
36.2.5	One should make an offering on a sloping ground for reproduction.
36.2.6	The seasons become (favourable).
36.2.7	"One should say, "May I be born."
36.2.8	They do not sow the Uttaravedi for reproduction.
36.2.9	He churns out Agni.
36.2.10	Animals are born after Agni for reproduction.
36.2.11	Then indeed he generates this bull for the sacrificer.
36.2.12	The clarified butter is indeed the animals.
36.2.13	The animals are of various forms.
36.2.14	Therefore the Agniya ghee is of one form, the Indra-Daitya is of another form, the IndraAgni is of another form. The deity is of one form.
36.2.15	Indra and Agni are indeed the inhalation and exhalation.
36.2.16	The inhalation and exhalation are a pair.
36.2.17	The offspring are born from a pair.
36.2.18	Therefore, from that very pair, offspring is born.
36.2.19	If one were to offer in spring, one should spread twice and pour once.
36.2.20	One establishes the plants.
36.2.21	If one offers in the rainy season, one should spread once and pour twice.
36.2.22	One seeks the animals with rain.
36.2.23	Offspring is born from the vital breaths.
36.2.24	These nine oblations are the vital airs.
36.2.25	There are nine vital airs.
36.2.26	The Self is the deity.
36.2.27	From that alone is born.
36.2.28	There are the nine Prayāja offerings.
36.2.29	There are also the nine Anuyāja offerings.
36.2.30	Two are the Ajyabhāga offerings.
36.2.31	There is the eightfold oblation.
36.2.32	He offers to Agni.
36.2.33	He offers the Vājinī.
36.2.34	That makes thirty.
36.2.35	The Viraj has thirty letters.
36.2.36	Viraj is food.
36.2.37	He stands firm in the food of Viraj.
36.2.38	Viraj has thirty syllables.
36.2.39	From the womb of Viraj, beings are born.
36.2.40	Viraj itself generates them from its womb.
36.2.41	Thirty-thirty nights make a month.
36.2.42	He who is the month is the year.
36.2.43	Prajapati is the year.
36.2.44	This is produced from the union of Prajapati and Viraj.
36.2.45	By offering each oblation, they obtained twelve nights each.
36.2.46	The number of nights in a year is the same.
36.2.47	One conquers one's brother by conquering the year.
36.2.48	By the Vaishvadeva (rite), they obtained four months.
36.2.49	With the Varuna-offerings, four more.
36.2.50	With the Soma-offerings, another four.
36.2.51	He thus wins them from his rival.
36.2.52	The four months that they won, that is why the Catu-r-masya sacrifices are called Catu-r masya.
36.3.1	One who desires offspring or cattle should offer the Visva-devya sacrifice, not the Varuna-prastha or the Soma-offer-ings.
36.3.2	All men are born with a thousand (lives).
36.3.3	He goes to the farthest (place).
36.3.4	This is the offering for procreation, namely, the Vaishvadeva.
36.3.5	He offers for procreation, saying, "I am going to my own mother."
36.3.6	When he goes to a thousand cattle, then he should offer the Varunapraghasa.
36.3.7	He makes amends for that thousand which he has gone to.
36.3.8	One who sacrifices to the seasons is different from one who sacrifices to the four months.
36.3.9	"He who was spring became autumn, he who was autumn became winter."
36.3.10	One who sacrifices to the seasonal deities is different from one sacrifices to the four seasons.
36.3.11	One who completes the thirteenth month sacrifices to the thirteenth month. He is the one who sacrifices to four months.
36.3.12	Having performed three regular sacrifices, one should abandon the fourth.
36.3.13-18	Having offered two Parā ṛju sacrifices, one should offer the third. Those who are the three years, they have thirty-six full months. Those who have two, they have twenty-four. Those who belong to the thirty-six, they attain twenty-four. This indeed is the thirteenth month. He accomplishes it.
36.3.19	He offers it.
36.3.20	When he offers on the sacrificial grass at the Prayāja offerings, he offers the plants. When he offers on the grass at the Anuyāja offerings,
36.3.21	he offers the fruit.
36.3.22	When he makes offerings on the grass at Vāritī offerings,
36.3.23	he makes offerings of what is born from the fruit.
36.3.24	 When he makes offerings on a stick, he makes offerings of the base.
36.3.25	Whatever is the dawn and the night, and the rising and setting of the sun, that he offers.
36.3.26	Whatever is the offering to the goddess of the dawn, whatever is the born, whatever is the about-to-be-born, that he offers
36.3.27	Whatever is the oblation to the goddess of nourishment, whatever is eaten and drunk, that he offers;
36.3.28	Whatever are the divine Hotars, these are the divine Hotar priests.
36.3.29	He offers them.
36.3.30	The three goddesses are indeed speech.
36.3.31	He indeed sacrifices speech.
36.3.32	Speech is indeed the metres.
36.3.33	He indeed offers the metres.
36.3.34	One offers to Narasamsa.
36.3.35	Indeed, the sacrifice is spread out as Tanunapada.
36.3.36	Narasamsa is not spread out.
36.3.37	Now the sacrifice is spread.
36.3.38	Therefore one offers to Narasamsa in the concluding offerings.
36.3.39	He sacrifices to Tvashtri.
36.3.40	For he creates forms.
36.3.41	He sacrifices to Vanaspathi.
36.3.42	Soma is indeed the Vana-pathi, the food.
36.3.43	These creatures are connected with Soma.
36.3.44	He places food in the creatures.
36.4.1	He sacrifices the Vajina.
36.4.2	The Vajina are indeed cattle.
36.4.3	He sacrifices them.
36.4.4	This is not like a good sacrifice.
36.4.5	When the sacrifice is concluded, when the enclosing sticks are thrown away, one offers.
36.4.6	By means of the offering of the Hotr, which is not repeated, the sacrifice is performed.
36.4.7	One offers in succession.
36.4.8	Agni is the final oblation.
36.4.9	Agni, the foundation, is the final oblations. By means of the final oblations, one is established.
36.4.10	The animals are the Vājinis.
36.4.11	If one were to establish them, one would establish them.
36.4.12	For these are not established, they are born in the morning.
36.4.13	He takes it while sprinkling the sacrificial grass.
36.4.14	He places the semen in the bulls.
36.4.15	Sacrificial grass is indeed progeny.
36.4.16	The horse is semen.
36.4.17	He places semen in progeny.
36.4.18	He offers while sitting with knees raised.
36.4.19	For the animal with raised knees is the animal.
36.4.20	He places seed in the animal.
36.4.21	They eat after having called together.
36.4.22	This is like drinking Soma.
36.4.23	All the priests drink.
36.4.24	"May the strong ones carry my sacrifice."
36.4.25	One should drink oneself.
36.4.26	One places strength in oneself.
36.5.1	They were created by Vaisvānara, and Varuna seized them in the youthful one.
36.5.2	And they say, "They indeed transgressed him.
36.5.3	Varuna caught them when they transgressed.
36.5.4	Therefore a father does not transgress.
36.5.5	Prajapati created beings with the Visvedevam.
36.5.6	His oblation was crushed by the Maruts.
36.5.7	Then they were created as afflicted by poison.
36.5.8	He desired a remedy for them.
36.5.9	He desired it for himself.
36.5.10	He then directed this (water) to his own self.
36.5.11	By that he removed the sin from himself.
36.5.12	The Varuna-grahas are indeed a protection against sin.
36.5.13	Varuna seizes one who has eaten.
36.5.14	Therefore the Varuna-graha.
36.5.15	As long as the young prince is born, so long does this blemish remain. He who performs the Varunapraghasa sacrifice, it is removed.
36.5.16	Then these five oblations are offered for continuity.
36.5.17	Savitri on eight potsherds.
36.5.18	Savitri is the Gayatri of the gods.
36.5.19	Indra-Agni on twelve potsherds for the sake of all gods.
36.5.20-25	Now when those creatures were seized by Varuna, they became feeble. Indra and Agni gave them strength. They did not breathe. Varuna seized them when they did not breathe. Now Indra and Agni are the out-breath and in-breath. They are placed in the middle of the out-breath (and in-breath). Varuna seized those creatures when they were feeble.
36.5.26	Ojas and strength are Indra and Agni.
36.5.27	Herein, indeed, is placed in the middle the strength and vigour.
36.5.28	The Marutī (verse) is for the purpose of non-deviation.
36.5.29	The Varuni (verse) is to be free from Varuna.
36.5.30	The Kayi (verse) is because of affection.
36.5.31	What was theirs, that became the affection of those who were seized by Varuna. Therefore, it is Kayi.
36.5.32	Prajapati, indeed, seized those creatures by Varuna.
36.5.33	Who is Prajapati?
36.5.34	He himself releases them from Varuna.
36.5.35	Truth is indeed the sacrifice.
36.5.36	Untruth is a woman.
36.5.37	She does an untruth when she, bought by her husband, goes with others.
36.5.38	She goes to truth, having removed untruth.
36.5.39	When she recites, she makes her worthy of sacrifice.
36.5.40	One should not speak in a loud voice.
36.5.41	If one speaks in a loud voice, one should be punished by the beloved.
36.6.1	They become ground with water.
36.6.2	For the protection of all kinds of sin.
36.6.3	If they were to be burnt, it would be a sin of ignorance.
36.6.4	Varuna seized them from the vessels.
36.6.5-11	He releases them from Varuna by means of the vessels themselves. They are for each person. He releases the sin for each person. The one (vessel) is for the embryo. He releases sin for the embryo. Varuna seized the offspring from food. They carry food in a basket.
36.6.12	Therefore, it is offered with a ladle.
36.6.13	The male and female offer.
36.6.14	They are indeed the offspring of the pair, they are released from Varuna.
36.6.15	Standing facing each other, they offer.
36.6.16	They indeed remove the evil in front.
36.6.17	Whatever vessels there are, whatever animals have two feet, they are the pairs, they remove the evil in the front by that.
36.6.18	The sheep and the ewe, and whatever animals are in pairs, above them he has removed the sin.
36.6.19	He has removed the sin from both sides, from the front and from above.
36.6.20	Having offered the oblations, he cleanses the fire.
36.6.21	"Where he has removed the sins, there he should offer oblations to the deities."
36.6.22	Whatever Varuna seizes, he does not seize the shami and the barley.
36.6.23	Varuna is indeed the winter.
36.6.24	Therefore these two do not dry up in winter.
36.6.25	By those which are not seized by Varuna, he is released from Varuna.
36.6.26	Barley is indeed Varuna's, belonging to Varuna.
36.6.27	By his own share, he appeases Varuna.
36.6.28	Now these are the animals of falsehood.
36.6.29	For from falsehood Varuna seized those creatures.
36.6.30	In that they are the animals of falsity, he indeed frees them from falsehood.
36.6.31	They become a male and a female.
36.6.32	He indeed frees the creatures from Varuna as a pair.
36.6.33	They become hairy for the sake of being fit for sacrifice.
36.6.34	As many animals as have taken hold of the hair, they have attained the sacrifice.
36.6.35	The leaves of the śamī tree are used for sprinkling.
36.6.36	This is the tree named Bhūrja.
36.6.37	The ladles should be made of it.
36.6.38	Prajapati did not attain the food.
36.6.39	He attained it by means of the hundred-fold.
36.6.40	One hundred things should be made for the attainment of food.
36.6.41	Sahasredhmas has indeed divided the Avista of the thousand from the Avista of sins.
36.6.42	The thousand tasks are to be done for the Avista of sin.
36.7.1	The Salavrikayas took the Yatis.
36.7.2	Their heads are these Kharjuras.
36.7.3	This is the Soma-drinking that shines forth, when there are Kariras.
36.7.4	When there are Kariras, one indeed obtains the Soma-drinking.
36.7.5	The mountains are the eldest offspring of Prajapati.
36.7.6	They were birds.
36.7.7	Wherever they desired to go, they flew down.
36.7.8	Then this earth was loose.
36.7.9	Indra cut off their wings.
36.7.10	With them he strengthened this earth.
36.7.11	Those that were wings became locusts.
36.7.12	Therefore they go to the mountain.
36.7.13	This is their source.
36.7.14	Therefore it rains most on the mountain.
36.7.15	When it rained, those karīra fruits fell.
36.7.16	Now in the rainy season, the Ujjīmūtas float.
36.7.17	They perform the Varuna-prastha sacrifices.
36.7.18	It indeed sustains the rain.
36.7.19	Therefore, it rains most.
36.7.20	It causes rain to continue.
36.7.21	They do not offer the Uttaravedi at the Vaishvadev.
36.7.22	They offer it at the Upastra.
36.7.23	He takes possession of the offspring with the offspring.
36.7.24	The Uttaravedi is the womb of the offspring that are here.
36.7.25	They are born from it.
36.7.26-32	The southern altar is the womb of the first-born creatures. They are born from it. Here he begets both the first-born and the later-born creatures. This indeed was the hand. This is not the hand. When they found this second hand in the second altar, therefore this is the encircling of that.
36.7.33	The younger one is the one who is to be bound.
36.7.34	Therefore, the younger one is bound by the elder one.
36.7.35	In a similar case.
36.7.36	For both hands are equal and are not separated, for the binding of sin.
36.7.37	If they were to be separated, there would be no binding of sin. They are bound together.
36.7.38	They are bound together for continuity.
36.7.39	They offer the oblation towards the north, not towards the south, for non-ascendancy.
36.7.40	Varuna is the Kshatra.
36.7.41	Maruts are the Vis.
36.7.42	They perform different sacrifices for the sake of avoiding evil.
36.7.43	Whatever the Adhvaryu does, the Pratiprasthata does.
36.7.44	Therefore, whatever the king does, the Vis does.
36.7.45	There are not thirty oblations in the Vaishvadev and the Saakamedha sacrifices.
36.7.46	In the Varuna-prâghasa oblations there are thirty oblations.
36.7.47	The Viraj man.
36.7.48	Ten fingers, ten toes, ten breaths, that is thirty.
36.7.49	The Viraja has thirty syllables.
36.7.50	The Virajas man.
36.7.51	When he now performs the Avabhrtha rite,
36.7.52	he removes his own sin.
36.7.53	Whatever of the sacrifice does not reach its proper form, that is taken by Varuna.
36.7.54	When one enters the water for the final bath,
36.7.55	One atones for whatever has been taken by Varuna with that very thing.
36.7.56	And also because whatever belongs to Varuna here is released by that.
36.7.57	They come without looking back, for the non-obstruction of Varuna.
36.7.58	"May I be prosperous, may we be prosperous."
36.7.59	They offer to Varuna in order to obtain prosperity.
36.7.60	"You are the kindling-wood, may we be kindled." He prays for a blessing.
36.7.61	"You have brilliance, bestow brilliance on me."
36.7.62	He bestows brilliance on himself.
36.8.1	Having created the offspring, he became anxious. He desired, "May I slay Vritra."
36.8.2	He, having become united with these deities, fled with the Maruts, with Agni, with the army.
36.8.3	Having approached Vritra, he stood, not being able to strike him, seeing Vritra standing with his thighs firmly grasped.
36.8.4	The Maruts carried him with their wind-chariots.
36.8.5	They carried him.
36.8.6	Where they reached his vital point, he became motionless.
36.8.7	They indeed heated him.
36.8.8	Therefore they are called Sāntapanas.
36.8.9	The Sākamedhas are the killers of Vṛtra.
36.8.10	Indra killed Vṛtra with Agni as his army. For the sake of having an army.
36.8.11	This Agni is the commander of the gods.
36.8.12	It is indeed the raising of the army.
36.8.13	Indra was unable to raise the thunderbolt against Vṛtra.
36.8.14	He offered this share to the Maruts.
36.8.15	The Maruts heated it for strength.
36.8.16	With that strength he seized the thunderbolt.
36.8.17	They heated it together.
36.8.18	Therefore they are called Sāntapanas (heaters).
36.8.19	It should be offered at midday.
36.8.20	Then indeed both ends are heated.
36.8.21	It is a cake.
36.8.22	For it is heated on all sides.
36.9.5-11	Or those who are to be conquered tomorrow, they are the conquerors. They stood against them with this. They bound them with this. This is the limit of cattle. Those who were to be conquered tomorrow stayed. They said, "Whose will this be tomorrow? Whose will cook?" They cooked this rice.
36.9.12	They said, "We have not eaten the Mahuta."
36.9.13	They offered it to the Maruts and the Grihamedhas.
36.9.14	The Maruts and the Gridhamedhas are indeed cattle.
36.9.15	They offered it only to them.
36.9.16	They were united.
36.9.17	The Asuras sent hunger to the gods.
36.9.18	The gods, having heard it, cooked this rice.
36.9.19	She, not knowing the world of the gods, again entered the Asuras.
36.9.20	She burned them.
36.9.21	One should cook rice for one's own house.
36.9.22	One sends hunger to one's own brother.
36.9.23	She burns him.
36.9.24	Indeed, among the four seasonal sacrifices, this is the animal sacrifice for them.
36.9.25	The domestic sacrifice is indeed the domestic sacrifice.
36.9.26	The Prayājas are not offered, nor the Anuyājas.
36.9.27	One does not recite the Sāmīdha-verses.
36.9.28	One offers the Ajyabhāgas.
36.9.29	The sacrifice is performed with that.
36.9.30	One dedicates to Agni.
36.9.31	Agni is the Samīṣṭi.
36.9.32	Agni the Pratiṣṭhī. By means of Samīṣṭī and Pratiṣṭhi.
36.9.33	The Gṛhamedhas are indeed animals.
36.9.34	The Ida is animals.
36.9.35	Therefore they invoke the Ida.
36.9.36	The offering is deposited for the continuity of the lineage.
36.9.37	Among them, Indra went away from both.
36.9.38	The gods deposited this share for Indra.
36.9.39	"May he tomorrow accept us as having deposited the share."
36.9.40	The cry of "Svāhā" is the roar.
36.9.41	And they indeed called out to the bull of the Asuras.
36.9.42	He calls the bull, saying, "May he generate us."
36.9.43	He thus invokes Indra.
36.9.44	And he also seizes the prosperity of his enemy.
36.10.1	The cows with their calves stay together for the sake of the Soma-sacrifice.
36.10.2	If the wife were not to eat, they would not be together for the Soma-sacrifice;
36.10.3	When the wife eats, they are together for the Soma sacrifice.
36.10.4	When a woman eats, she takes away the share of Nirriti from the sacrifice.
36.10.5	Nirriti is a woman.
36.10.6	The ladle is the hand of a woman.
36.10.7	When one offers with the ladle, one appeases Nirriti with Nirriti.
36.10.8	What share of the sacrifice does not reach its proper form, that Nirriti takes away.
36.10.9	The ladle has been taken away by Nirriti.
36.10.10	For he moves in the heated (fire).
36.10.11	When he offers with the ladle, he appeases Nirriti by means of Nirriti.
36.10.12	He then fled to slay Vritra the next day.
36.10.13	The Maruts came to play around him.
36.10.14	They placed him in the Apva.
36.10.15	They attacked him.
36.10.16	Therefore, (the game) is called Kridaya.
36.10.17	They were united.
36.10.18	The gods did not see the Asuras' supreme end.
36.10.19	They saw the Maruts playing among the Kridins.
36.10.20	They knew, "These are the victorious ones."
36.10.21	They poured this share for them.
36.10.22	Then they conquered.
36.10.23	It is indeed for victory.
36.10.24	The sun is indeed Indra.
36.10.25	The rays are the play.
36.10.26	They move together with the rays, having conquered.
36.10.27	The gods did not know Vritra, who had been slain.
36.10.28	The Maruts played with him.
36.10.29	Therefore, they are games.
36.10.30	Then these five oblations for continuity.
36.10.31	Then Indra-Agni.
36.10.32	Indra and Agni struck him with the thunderbolt.
36.10.33-41	Then they say, Indra and Agni have given him the thunderbolt. Then the Indra (offering). By this Indra killed Vritra. He brought forth this Uddhara. It is indeed his Uddhara. This is his share. Then of Visvakarman. All my deeds are done. For he became Visvakarman after killing Vritra.
36.10.42	"O Agni, the Hotr-priest, the Dūta-priest," he offers the Āghāra libation.
36.10.43	For the fulfilment of the offerings, for the thirtyfold (number of offerings).
36.11.1	Having created the beings, having defeated the Asuras, having killed Vṛtra, they desired immortality.
36.11.2	The heavenly world is immortality.
36.11.3	Twelve months are a year, the heavenly world.
36.11.4	By means of the twelve oblations, he touches immortality.
36.11.5	He makes the year complete.
36.11.6	The year is indeed a calamity.
36.11.7	When he completes it six times, there are six seasons.
36.11.8	He thus restores the seasons.
36.11.9	He follows them as they are being restored.
36.11.10	From that he is born.
36.11.11	This is indeed more than a year.
36.11.12	If there are twelve oblations, the year is indeed completed.
36.11.13	This is indeed a year of calamity.
36.11.14	The fathers are the seasons.
36.11.15	He indeed generates him.
36.11.16	He is born after the one who is born.
36.11.17	This indeed was his year of desire.
36.11.18	The seasons were desired.
36.11.19	Then his ancestors are not pleased.
36.11.20	By this sacrifice to the ancestors, his ancestors become pleased and satisfied.
36.11.21	It should be offered on the right side.
36.11.22	Because the ancestors are on the right side (of the sacrificer).
36.11.23	It should be placed on both sides.
36.11.24	Because both are worshipped.
36.11.25	That is not to be guarded.
36.11.26	It should only be offered on the left side.
36.11.27	The Pitrs are indeed the recipients of offerings.
36.11.28	The oblation is made of six potfuls of flour.
36.11.29	There are six seasons.
36.11.30	By this he pleases and satisfies the seasons.
36.11.31	There is no sacrifice with cooked rice or with gruel.
36.11.32	The sacrifice is performed by this oblation.
36.11.33	Now these cooked rice.
36.11.34	These are the nectar-like (waters) in the other world, the nights of the year are unlimited.
36.11.35	These are the ones that are desired by him, they are pleased with these.
36.11.36	The Pitryajna is not performed with cooked rice or with oblations.
36.11.37	It is performed with this churning.
36.11.38	It is churned from a cow that has calved recently.
36.11.39	Because she belongs to the Pitrs.
36.12.7	He satisfies both, the gods and the ancestors.
36.12.8	The altar has four corners.
36.12.9	For the ancestors are in all directions.
36.12.10	They perform the sacrifice when the altar is surrounded.
36.12.11	For the fathers are hidden from this world.
36.12.12	And also the fathers are hidden to the gods and to men.
36.12.13	He places the sacrificial grass with its roots.
36.12.14	That is for the Pitrs.
36.12.15	That which is without roots is for the gods.
36.12.16	Both are worshipped.
36.12.17	One spreads the sacrificial grass all around, going around.
36.12.18	The seasons are spread all around.
36.12.19	One who goes around the Pitryajna goes away from this world.
36.12.20	When one spreads and goes around again, one returns to this world.
36.12.21	In the former one, the gods perform the sacrifice.
36.12.22	If one were to perform a sacrifice there, one would mix the oblations.
36.12.23	One would make it equal.
36.12.24	They prepare the cooked oblation in the Garhapatya.
36.12.25	With that, the sacrifice is performed.
36.12.26	They bring the fire from the rice-cooking.
36.12.27	That is not brought from anywhere else.
36.12.28	He recites, "We invoke you, O Agni, with praises."
36.12.29	The Fathers are indeed the Ushanas.
36.12.30	He recites the Anushtubh verse.
36.12.31	The Anushtubh is the end.
36.12.32	The Fathers are the end.
36.12.33	And the Anushtubb includes all the metres.
36.12.34	He recits one verse.
36.12.35	The Fathers belong to one world.
36.12.36	He recitess it three times.
36.12.37	For the Fathers belong to the third world.
36.12.38	In that he recites one verse, thereby (he recites) for the Fathers.
36.12.39	By reciting three times, he (the sacrificer) becomes one with the gods.
36.12.40	Both are worshipped.
36.12.41	He does not choose an officiating priest or a Hotṛ.
36.12.42	He releases them from death.
36.12.43	He offers the Prāyājas without the sacrificial grass.
36.12.44	Sacrificial grass is progeny.
36.12.45	He releases progeny from death.
36.12.46	One who is about to perform a sacrifice is released from human beings.
36.12.47	He offers to the gods on the right side.
36.12.48	Here, having turned away with the garment worn over the right shoulder,
36.12.49	having taken it from the right side and having gone around towards the north, having turned towards the right, he offers.
36.12.50	For the ancestors are on the right side
36.13.1	He first offers to Soma.
36.13.2	Soma is the deity of the ancestors.
36.13.3	For Soma is the deity of ancestors.
36.13.4	When he offers Soma to the Pitrs, he offers to the Pitrs who are connected with Soma.
36.13.5	When he offers to those who have the sacrificial grass, he offers to those.
36.13.6	When he makes offerings to those who have Agni in their houses, he offers to them.
36.13.7	When he (offers) to Agni, the carrier of oblations,
36.13.8	Agni has two forms.
36.13.9	The form that carries oblations to the gods,
36.13.10	and the form that carries oblatioins to the Pitrs.
36.13.11	Agni is the Samishti.
36.13.12	Agni is the Prathishti. By means of the Samishti, he is established in the Prathishtis.
36.13.13	He offers five times five oblations.
36.13.14	There are five seasons.
36.13.15	He offers the Vashat with "Svadha, Namas."
36.13.16	Svadha is for the Pitrs, and Namas for the Devas.
36.13.17	There are two Yajya and Anu-Yajya for the Devas,
36.13.18	He gives with the other.
36.13.19	He sends it away with another (verse).
36.13.20	Here three (verses) are to be employed for exclusion.
36.13.21	Two are the Anuvākyā verses,
36.13.22	and one is the Yājyā verse.
36.13.23	The Fathers are indeed different from the Gods.
36.13.24	He gives it away with this third (verse).
36.13.25	The Fathers of men follow the Gods.
36.13.26	Hereby he has approached the Gods and the Fathers.
36.13.27-34	He puts it on the sacrificial grass. By that he worships men and ancestors. He puts it down three times. For three kinds of men are known here. He mentions three beyond. For there are three: father, son, and grandson, for continuity. He puts (the oblation) on all the sacrificial grass. He sends it to all directions.
36.13.35	All the fathers are in all directions.
36.13.36	One should not place it here.
36.13.37	If one were to place it here, Death would seize them.
36.13.38	They rise up following her.
36.13.39	When one smears it there,
36.13.40	it is with that alone that he delights them.
36.13.41	They go out saying, "Here, O fathers, do you delight."
36.13.42	They approach the Āhavanīya fire.
36.13.43	We have come to thee, O well-seeing one. They stand thus.
36.13.44	Those who perform the Pitryajna go to the end of life.
36.13.45	Having made Agni the observer, they go to the end.
36.13.46	They return, saying, "The departed fathers are Soma-like."
36.13.47	The fathers follow them for the sake of turning back.
36.13.48	They offer the oblations with the words, "The Fathers have been pleased."
36.13.49	They place a piece of wool or a piece of cloth.
36.13.50	Whatever they reach there, that is for the sake of the oblation.
36.13.51	He sprinkles water.
36.13.52	He cleanses.
36.13.53	Sprinkling again, he goes around.
36.13.54	Those who perform the Father's sacrifice go to this world.
36.13.55-62	Prajapati is indeed worthy to lead them forth. That he recites this unformulated hymn of Prajapati, "He who is the creator, the father, the generator, the lord." Prajapati indeed leads them forth. The sacrifice indeed went to the fathers. They return by the Paṅkti. The sacrifice is Paṅkti. It is with the sacrifice that they return.
36.13.63	His mind goes to the Pitrs.
36.13.64	"They say, "The mind is indeed the guest."
36.13.65	He again invites it.
36.14.1	"This is his wish for the year: "May the Pitrs be pleased."
36.14.2	"The Pitrs are pleased."
36.14.3	"Now his wish for Rudra is: "May the Rudras be pleased."
36.14.4	The Rudras are Tryambaka.
36.14.5	"Since they are Tryambaka, his wish for the Rudras is fulfilled and they are pleased."
36.14.6-13	They are for each person. He offers the Rudra oblation for each person. The oblation is for each person. It is for one person. It is for the embryo. He offers the Rudra offering for the embryo. The oblation for the embryo is for one person, for one skull. The skulls are for one person. A person should not be offered with skulls. He offers it to one person. They debate whether to pour clarified butter or not.
36.14.14-23	They should be poured over only once. For the oblation is not poured over twice. If one were to pour it over twice, one would invite Rudra to the cattle. Therefore, they should not be poured over twice. They take it with one ladle. For one ladle is of Rudra. They take it with smoke. For smoke is of Rudra.
36.14.24	They carry this direction.
36.14.25	In this direction are the houses of the Rudras.
36.14.26	He appeases Rudra in the houses.
36.14.27	"He says, "I make you a beast, a rat."
36.14.28	He sows a seed of a rat-killer.
36.14.29	He appeasess Rudra for the beasts.
36.14.30	Therefore, Pashupati is the slayer of them.
36.14.31	They sacrifice at the crossroads.
36.14.32	The houses of the Rudras are at the crossroads.
36.14.33	In the houses they offer the oblation to Rudra.
36.14.34	"He offers it with the formula, "This is your share, O Rudra, together with your sister Ambika; do you accept it, svāhā."
36.14.35	Ambika is the sister of Rudra in autumn.
36.14.36	He follows her.
36.14.37	Therefore he kills most in autumn.
36.14.38	With her alone he offers the oblation to him.
36.14.39	He offers with the middle leaf.
36.14.40	For that is not killed by Raksases.
36.14.41	If he were to offer with a leaf from a village tree, he would lead Rudra to his cattle.
36.14.42	Therefore, one offers with a leaf from the forest.
36.14.43	"He says, "May we not offend Rudra."
36.14.44	They became free from injury.
36.14.45	"Medicine for the cow, the horse, and the man,"
36.14.46	Having become free from injury, they created medicine.
36.14.47	"We worship Tryambaka." Thus they conclude.
36.14.48	If a woman who desires a husband should go, she should go.
36.14.49	They make her know her husband.
36.14.50	They obtain them after abandoning them.
36.14.51	Having become free from debt, they obtain the blessing.
36.14.52	They pour them into the sacrificer.
36.14.53	They pour the blessing into him.
36.14.54	If a girl who desires a husband goes, they should pour it into her.
36.14.55	They pour the oblation into his mouth.
36.14.56	Having made them into dough, they approach the tree.
36.14.57	"This is your share, O Rudra."
36.14.58	"With this oblation, may you go beyond the world of the shining ones."
36.14.59	The mountain is the birthplace of Rudra.
36.14.60	From there he approaches.
36.14.61	He sends him to his own birthplace with his own share.
36.14.62	They come without looking back, for the non-interference of Rudra.
36.14.63	"He is the fire, we are the fire." Thus they offer to Rudra in order to obtain fire.
36.14.64	"You are the kindling-stick, we are the kindler." Thus he prays for a blessing.
36.14.65	"You have the brilliance, give me the brilliance." Thus he places brilliance in himself.
36.14.66	Amba is the name of a woman.
36.14.67	Therefore they are called Tryambaka.
36.14.68	The oblation of him who does not stand firm is not firm, the three-headed ones are not firm.
36.14.69	The Prayājas are not offered, nor the Anuyājas.
36.14.70	The Sāmidhenī verses are not recited.
36.14.71	He offers a cake to Aditi.
36.14.72	This is Aditi.
36.14.73	She is the firm one.
36.14.74	He stands firm in her.
37.1.1	Prajapati created the creatures.
37.1.2	They fled from him.
37.1.3	They desired to return to him.
37.1.4	He cooked this rice.
37.1.5	Having become food, it stood in one form.
37.1.6	Not finding food elsewhere, they returned to Prajapati as the one who eats food.
37.1.7	As many and as great as the creatures speak, they all come together for food for him who is consecrated with this (rite).
37.1.8	This is the rite of the rice-gruel.
37.1.9	"He is the king, he is the Viraj."
37.1.10	All these (rites) are like this.
37.1.11	All the foods, all the men.
37.1.12	He wins all the grains.
37.1.13	He gives gold to the Brahman.
37.1.14	He buys splendor with that.
37.1.15	Three arrows.
37.1.16	He buys strength for the king with that.
37.1.17	Eight arrows.
37.1.18	He purchases prosperity for the Vaishya with that.
37.1.19	A handful of beans.
37.1.20	The Śūdra buys it with his life.
37.1.21	He binds gold.
37.1.22	He establishes it in him.
37.1.23	When he eats rice, he establishes everything in him as one.
37.1.24	It is done on a red-coloured (cow).
37.1.25	Because the Brahmanas are red.
37.1.26	Whatever is done at sunrise, that is the form of Prajapati. When he rises,
37.1.27	all beings greet him.
37.1.28	He becomes visible to those who desire to see him.
37.1.29	They debate whether one should know or not know.
37.1.30	When one purifies with darbha grass and wool, one knows that.
37.1.31	One does not know that.
37.1.32	He does both.
37.1.33	He purifies with two.

37.2.13	This is the supremacy of speech for the Brahman.
37.2.14	The Agniṣṭoma is the Agniṣṭoma because it is connected with Agni and Soma.
37.2.15	When they come together, then one becomes powerful.
37.2.16	The Sārasvata is the Sarasvatī because speech is Sarasvatī.
37.2.17	This is the direct control of speech for the Brāhmaṇa.
37.2.18	The Vāruṇa is for being free from Varuna.
37.2.19	He who is born as a Varuna is born as a Vāruṇa.
37.2.20	When Indra hurled the thunderbolt at Vritra,
37.2.21	the heaven and earth did not approve of it.
37.2.22	He approved of it with this oblation.
37.2.23	This is the approval of the thunderbolt.
37.2.24	May he be approved by the thunderbolt.
37.2.25	Because there are eight oblations, the Gayatri has eight syllables.
37.2.26	Brahma is the Gayatri.
37.2.27	He is anointed with the black antelope skin, saying, "May Brahma anoint thee."

37.5.11	Seed is Soma.
37.5.12	Whatever else is done at the Rajasuya apart from the Stoma, all that is done here.
37.5.13	Now this is the Marut-svana with twenty-one potsherds.
37.5.14	It has a share for Agni.
37.5.15	Then he is consecrated.
37.6.5	This is the Goṣava.
37.6.6	Just as a cow, so does one become who is consecrated with this.

37.6.18	This is a Stoma for cattle.
37.6.19	By that one performs the Go-sava.
37.7.1	The Stotra is three-fold.
37.7.2	The three-fold is indeed Brahman-splendour.

37.7.15	This is indeed the form of Brahmavratas
37.7.16	He obtains Brahmavratas by means of the form.
37.7.17	This is one Sāman, one Stoma, one Chandaḥ.
37.7.18	He should give eleven (cows) for each pressing, for the exclusion of the pressings.
37.7.19	They amount to thirty-three.
37.7.20	There are thirty-three deities.
37.7.21	He indeed wins the deities.
37.7.22	He gives a horse as the thirty-fourth.
37.7.23	Prajapati is the thirty-fourth
37.7.24	He indeed attains Prajapati.
37.7.25	The gods did not give it to Brihaspati.
37.7.26	Prajapati performed this sacrifice for him.
37.7.27	Then they gave it to him.
37.7.28	This is the Brihaspati-sacrifice.
37.7.29	One who desires Brahmic glory should perform this sacrifice.
37.7.30	One becomes Brahmic glory.
37.7.31	This is its fixed rule.

37.10.1	May Bodha and Praty-bodha protect us from the front, and Asvapna and Manavadraṇa from the right; May Gopāyamāna and Rakṣamāna protect us from the rear, and Jagrvi and Mārunḍatī from the left; May Anāmitra be our protector from below, and Anāmitra from above.

37.10.4	O Arundhati, who protects, guards, and watches over us, who are awake and alert, the gods who are the protectors of the body, may they protect our bodies here.
37.10.5	"The meaning of the verse is as follows: "Awake and alert" means being awake and alert."
37.10.6	The sun is the awakener.
37.10.7	Fire is the alert one.
37.10.8	"The verse says, "Who are awake and alert."
37.10.9	The moon is the non-sleeping one.
37.10.10	The one who blows is the non-drifter.
37.10.11	He who protects, he who guards.
37.10.12	He who protects during the day.
37.10.13	He who guards during the night.
37.10.14	He who is awake, Arundhati.
37.10.15	The sacrifice is the one who is awake.
37.10.16	Arundhati is the Dakshina.
37.10.17	These indeed are the gods who support the kingdom.
37.10.18	One should know them for one's own protection.
37.11.1	Those who support the kingdom and those who support the kingdom, they are the ones to whom the royal offering should be given.
37.11.2	These indeed, are those vital airs.
37.11.3	He gives him over to them.
37.11.4	These are their wives. He follows them. Here also it should be done.
37.11.5	This is done for them.
37.11.6	For they follow them.
37.11.7	One who desires a Purodha should perform.
37.11.8	He makes the Brahman and the Kshatra yoked together.
37.11.9	If he were to attack a kingdom, he should say, "May this Brahman protect me." He should not attack a kingdom.
37.11.10	For even in Brahman, the kingdom is established.
37.11.11	The kingdom is within Brahman itself. It is Brahman that rules over the kingdom.
37.11.12	One who is about to attack should do so.
37.11.13	One should do so in battle.
37.11.14	Those who support the kingdom and those who are supported by the kingdom, he should approach them.
37.11.15	They support his kingdom.
37.11.16	He who knows the duality of these worlds, the supporter of the kingdom, his kingdom does not suffer.
37.11.17	Agni and his mind, Vayu and the sky, Yajna and the sun, and the moon and the chariot of heaven are the seven.
37.11.18	For he carries away fear.
37.11.19	The thirty-seven are armored.
37.11.20	The thirty seven are bow-wielders.
37.11.21	The three-sevenfold ones are the weapons.
37.11.22	From them comes the gift to the king.
37.11.23	These indeed are the vital airs.
37.11.24	He gives it to them alone.
37.11.25	The gods and the Asuras were at war with each other, the gods at the Agniṣṭoma and the Asuras at the Ukthas.
37.11.26	When the gods came to the Ukthas and conquered the Ukthas, then Indra said:
37.11.27	And who will bring it here?'
37.11.28	'I will,' said Varuna.
37.11.29	Varuna followed him.
37.11.30	Indra brought it.
37.11.31	He said, 'Who will bring it here now?'
37.11.32	'I shall,' said Brihaspati.
37.11.33	Brihaspati followed him.
37.11.34	And Indra brought it.
37.11.35	He said, "Who will bring this?"
37.11.36	"I will," said Vishnu.
37.11.37	Vishnu followed him.
37.11.38	Indra brought it.
37.11.39	It is by means of these deities that the gods took possession of the Asuras' kingdom.
37.11.40	With these very deities, having taken the kingdom from his brother, and having made that kingdom, he gives it to those who are the upholders of the kingdom and those who are the followers of the kingdom.
37.11.41	"This is what is upheld, may it not perish."
37.11.42	The kingdom is indeed the sun.
37.11.43	The seasons are the upholders.
37.11.44	He gives it to them.
37.11.45	"May this be borne, may this not be injured."
37.11.46	He who is the seventh is indeed Prajapati himself.
37.11.47	If one were to offer in the middle, one would scatter him.
37.11.48	One should offer beyond the cow-pen.
37.11.49	Then indeed one does not scatter him.
37.11.50	Standing above, one offers.
37.11.51	For standing above, one is more vigorous.
37.11.52	One offers with a full ladle.
37.11.53	Prajapati is full.
37.11.54	He indeed attains Prajapati.
37.12.1	The gods and the Asuras indeed performed the sacrifice together.
37.12.2	Whatever the gods did, the Asuras did that.
37.12.3	The gods saw these (officiating) priests.
37.12.4	They won Agni and plants with the first (rite).
37.12.5	The sun and the minds with the second.
37.12.6	The moon and the stars with the third.
37.12.7	The sacrifice and the sacrificial fee with the fourth.
37.12.8	The Asuras were without sacrifice, without sacrificial fee, without stars, whatever they did was a crime.
37.12.9	Therefore one should not offer oblations in the house without sacrificial fee.
37.12.10	Whatever one does, one commits a crime.
37.12.11	Prajapati and the Rks and Sāmans with the fifth.
37.12.12-19	The wind, the waters, the plants, and strength, with the sixth. This is all that exists. Whatever exists, that he won for them with these. This is the seventh Prajapati. With that he drove them away. Then the gods became, the Asuras became. One who has an enemy should offer with these. Whatever exists,
37.12.20	As long as there is, he wins over his enemy by these.
37.12.21	This is the seventh Prajapati. By this he drives him away.
37.12.22	One becomes oneself.
37.12.23	One's enemy becomes distant.
37.12.24	One should sacrifice with these to a king engaged in battle.
37.12.25	This is all that there is.
37.12.26	As long as there is he wins over them by these.
37.12.27	This is the seventh Prajapati. He drives them away with it for victory.
37.12.28	He indeed conquers.
37.12.29	One should perform this sacrifice if the kingdom is seen to be slack.
37.12.30	Having yoked all the chariots of those who are the best, one should offer the right wheel of the best chariot in a ditch.
37.12.31	The chariot is indeed power.
37.12.32	By means of power, he destroys their kingdom.
37.12.33	They take the chariot wheel.
37.12.34	The chariot indeed is the thunderbolt.
37.12.35	They remove the sin of these (sacrificers) with the thunderbolt itself.
37.12.36	If the prescribed oblation is exceeded, it becomes (available) to them in the channel through which one offers.
37.12.37	That is the Dakṣiṇā for prosperity.
37.14.1	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a contest.
37.14.2	At that time, nectar was in the Asuras, in the Sunas, in the Dānavas.
37.14.3	He (Indra) placed it in the mouth of Shusna.
37.14.4	What gods he killed, that became his own.
37.14.5	What Asuras he killed, those Shusna revived with nectar.
37.14.6	They became equal.
37.14.7	Indra knew this.
37.14.8	"The nectar was among the Asuras, and Shusna is a Dānava."
37.14.9	He lay down on the path in the form of a honey-bee.
37.14.10	He (Indra) cut it open.
37.14.11	Indra, having become a hawk, took out the nectar from it.
37.14.12	Therefore, he is the most vigorous among the animals.
37.14.13	This is Indra's only form.
37.14.14	He who knows this bears immortality.
37.14.15	If one desires:
37.14.16	"May the one suffering from disease live."
37.14.17	Having cut it open, one should recite it.
37.14.18	He anoints him with nectar alone.
37.14.19	He lives.
37.14.20	He attains the whole span of life.
37.14.21	He does not die before his time.
37.14.22	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in a battle.
37.14.23	The gods killed the Asuras.
37.14.24	Those who remained among them
37.14.25	followed the gods.
37.14.26	They came to them, seeking protection and being accepted.
37.14.27	The gods made a pact.
37.14.28	They saw the two, the Brahman-going and the god-going.
37.14.29	They released them from them.
37.14.30	They burned them.
37.14.31	They came to them, being released, and being burned.
37.14.32	Those who were released from them entered among men.
37.14.33	Those born are the Yatudhanas, the others are the Carvadas.
37.14.34	For the demons, the carnivorous spirits, the pisācas, and the Rākṣasas do not have power over him.
37.14.35	He who knows this is not affected by a curse or by an attack.
37.14.36	If someone were to say to him, "You are a demon," he should not deny it.
37.14.37	For these two are his demons.
37.14.38	"Who are you? Which one are you?"
37.14.39	This is the Brahman demon.
37.14.40	Therefore he also offers it.
37.14.41	"He says, "Thou art the god, do thou protect us with the Gayatri metre during the day."
37.14.42	He offers himself to the day.
37.14.43	"Thou art the kind one, thou art kind to the biped and the quadruped."
37.14.44	He offers to him the bipeds and the quadrupeds.
37.14.45	"Thou are the sun, the seed of the horse, the divine steed."
37.14.46	You are the messenger of the gods.
37.14.47	You are my messenger.
37.14.48	Remove the evil.
37.14.49	This is indeed the messenger of the god.
37.14.50	Therefore he places him on that (fire).
37.14.51	"You, O god, protect us with the Tristubh metre from the night."
37.14.52	He gives himself to the night.
37.14.53	You are the killer, the killer of the evil, of the bipeds and the quadrupeds.
37.14.54	He also offers him animals, both bipeds and quadrupeds.
37.14.55	"You are the support."
37.14.56	"You are a pillar."
37.14.57	These two are Yama's horses, day and night.
37.14.58	They are approaching the humans here, trying to catch them.
37.14.59	He offers him animals, trying to catch him.
37.14.60	They are trying to catch him, approaching him.
37.14.61	When he thinks that he is afflicted by the dissolution,
37.14.62	he should offer the oblation with the formula, "To Agni, the remover of enmity, svāhā."
37.14.63	The lord is the one who afflicts, the one who is not peaceful, and the one who is against. For the peace of that,
37.16.1	The Asuras placed those (objects) against the gods. The gods saw them.
37.16.2	The gods placed those (objects), which were against the Asuras, against the Asuras. The Asuras did not see them.
37.16.3	Then the gods became victorious.
37.16.4	May the enemies be defeated.
37.16.5	Where no one else sees, there one should bury them.
37.16.6	For the destruction of the enemy.
37.16.7	One becomes oneself.
37.16.8	The enemy becomes defeated.
37.16.9	"Svāhā to the earth, svāhā to the atmosphere, svāhā svāhā to heaven."
37.16.10	These are the three worlds.
37.16.11	He gives him away from these worlds.
37.16.12	"Svāhākāmaye."
37.16.13	Life is the supreme desire.
37.16.14	He indeed attains life through that.
37.16.15	"Svāhā to sleep!"
37.16.16	Those who harm him while he is sleeping, Sleep protects him from them.
37.16.17	"Svāh to the day! Svāhā to the night!"
37.16.18	There are two seasons: day and night.
37.16.19	He indeed gives him over to them.
37.16.20	He offers these seven oblations,
37.16.21	There are seven vital airs.
37.16.22	He places them in him.
37.16.23	He spreads them over him.
37.16.24	He makes them not to depart from him.
37.16.25	He anoints the stone with ghee.
37.16.26	For this is his soul now.
37.16.27	Ghee is splendour.
37.16.28	He anoint his soul with splendour as much as it is.
37.16.29	He anoinits on all sides.
37.16.30	He thus makes him prosperous in every way.
37.16.31	"He says, "You are satisfied, I am satisfied."
37.16.32	He thus declares his own greatness through the vital airs.
37.16.33	For the vital airs are greatness.
37.16.34	" "My father is heaven, my mother is earth, my eye is the sun, my breath is the wind."
37.16.35	He thus gives himself to these deities.
37.16.36	I am the one who is covered. He gives this self of the sky and earth.
37.16.37	He gives the self of the sky-earth.
37.16.38	He resorts to them, he advances towards them.

37.16.41	He advances to the protection of the cows.
37.16.42	For the non-injury of the self.
37.16.43	"He says, "Protect from enemies, protect from injury, protect from the curse of the non-divine," he seeks blessings."
37.16.44	He removes the stone from all sides.
37.16.45	This is the stone that protects him from all sides. He throws it away.
37.16.46	This is how big the self is.
37.16.47	He digs a pit the size of his arm.
37.16.48	This is as big as a man is.
37.16.49	Having determined that, he places the stone and gold.
37.16.50	He places it on the northern half of this (earth).
37.16.51	It becomes unburied.
37.16.52	He buries it facing the navel.

37.16.57	"He recites, 'I have raised the speech, the thought.'
37.16.58	He digs out these (stones) and then raises them.
37.16.59	The altar should be of the same size as the body.
37.16.60	For the body is the only armour.
37.16.61	If it were not of the same size, it would not be done for oneself.
37.16.62	The altar is as big as the earth.
37.16.63	It is within the limits of this (earth) that the city is built.

37.17.2	Vasishtha alone saw him directly.
37.17.3	He feared that he would tell the other sages.
37.17.4	He said, "I will tell you how your priests will beget offspring. But do not tell this to the other sages."
37.17.5	Therefore he spoke these Stomabhāga hymns.
37.17.6	Then the offspring were begotten by Vasistha as the priest.
37.17.7	The Stoma is their share.
37.17.8	That is why the Stomabhāgas are called Stomabhāgās.

37.17.61	To the cattle thee!
37.17.62	Thou dost win the cattle."

37.17.68	Thou art Abhijit, the yoked stone,
37.17.69	To Indra thee!
37.17.70	"He makes Indra flourish."
37.17.71	The sixteen-fold (rite) is indeed the thunderbolt.
37.17.72	The thunderbolt is excluded from others.
37.17.73	Therefore this (rite) is excluded from others (than the sixteen-fold).
37.17.74	You are the lord.
37.17.75	For your breath.

1.1.1	In this world, both gods and men were present.
1.1.2	The gods, going to the heavenly world, said to Agni:
1.1.3	"You be the overseer of this world for us."
1.1.4	Agni said to them:
1.1.5	"And if I am the one who touches you with terrible touch,
1.1.6	Men are not to be served.
1.1.7	How will it be for you among men?"
1.1.8	The gods said:
1.1.9	"We will place your terrible body there."
1.1.10	"And whatever of your bodies is auspicious, gentle, and fit for sacrifice,"
1.1.11	"You will be here among men."
1.1.12	They placed the Pavamana in the waters.
1.1.13	The Pavaka in the wind.
1.1.14	The Shuchi in the sun.
1.1.15	Now that body of his which was auspicious, auspicious for sacrifice,
1.1.16	it burned here among men.
1.1.17	These are the bodies of Agni.
1.1.18	When he offers to these deities,
1.1.19	Agni becomes pleased with his limbs and bodies.
1.1.20	They are three in number.
1.1.21	There are three worlds here.
1.1.22	He attains these worlds.
1.2.1-7	The first one is the full-moon sacrifice. The second one is the new-moon sacrifice. Thus the new-moon and full-moon sacrifices are commenced. The first one is the offering to the invited gods and the offering to the gods of heaven. This is the form of the offering to the invoked gods. The second is the two fires. One offers to two fires.
1.2.8	The third one has seventeen kindling verses.
1.2.9	The animal to be sacrificed in the Isti and the animal to be sacrificed at the binding of the fire are seventeen kindling verses in number.
1.2.10	One obtains the animal to be offered in the Isti.
1.2.11	The two portions of clarified butter have the same end.
1.2.12	One puts down the fires with the formula, "May I be."
1.2.13	One desires to be.
1.2.14	If one puts down the fires while being one's own self, one becomes a hero.
1.2.15	It is quickly accomplished.
1.2.16	It quickly attains to be enjoyed.
1.2.17	He who makes the two ends of the sacrificial grass.
1.2.18	In the Viraj offering.
1.2.19	Sri is Viraj, food.
1.2.20	For the attainment of Sri and Viraj, food,
1.2.21	They become Gāyatrī verses.
1.2.22	Agni is Gāyatrī, the Gāyatrī metre.
1.2.23	He establishes Agni with its own metre.
1.2.24	They are performed in a low voice.
1.2.25	The depositing of fire is the spreading of semen.
1.2.26	Semen is spread in a low voice (in the womb).
1.2.27	They become similar.
1.2.28	What is similar at a sacrifice, that is prosperous. For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
1.2.29	One should give twelve (cows).
1.2.30	Twelve months are a year.
1.2.31	For the attainment of the year.
1.2.32	He gives a horse as the thirteenth.
1.2.33	For the attainment of the thirteenth month.
1.3.1	The gods and the Asuras were engaged in these worlds.
1.3.2	From them Agni fled.
1.3.3	He entered the seasons.
1.3.4	The gods, having slain the Asuras and conquered, sought Agni.
1.3.5	Yama and Varuna saw him.
1.3.6	They invited him.
1.3.7	They appointed him.
1.3.8	They gave him a boon.
1.3.9	He chose this boon:
1.3.10	"My Prāyājas and Anuyājas, only ghee, water, and the person of plants."
1.3.11	Therefore they say, "The Prāyājas, Anuyājas are dedicated to Agni, the ghee is dedicated to Agni."
1.3.12	Then the gods became
1.3.13	superior to the Asuras.
1.3.14	One becomes superior to oneself.
1.3.15	One's enemy becomes inferior, who knows thus.
1.3.16	They say, in which season should one again perform the rite?
1.3.17	Some say, in the rainy season.
1.3.18	For in the rainy season all desires are fulfilled.
1.3.19	For the fulfillment of all desires.
1.3.20	One should again perform the rite, looking at the Punarvasu constellation in the middle of the rainy season,
1.3.21	with the thought, "May wealth and prosperity come to me again."
1.3.22	And also for the fulfillment of desire.
1.3.23-30	Now, that does not coincide with the waning of the moon in the month of Pratipad. The new moon which is above the month of Ashadha. One should again perform the rite on that day. It coincides with the waning of moon in the month Pratipad. When one desires to perform the rite on the new moon day, one should perform it in the rainy season. One should perform it in Pratipad. Therefore, one should perform the rite on this day.
1.3.31	The cake on five potsherds is offered.
1.3.32	The Paṅkti metre has five feet.
1.3.33	The sacrifice is Paṅkti. For the attainment of the sacrifice.
1.4.1	He offers the Prayāja and Anuyāja with Vibhakti.
1.4.2	The Prayāja and Anūyāja are the seasons.
1.4.3	They then bring him to the seasons.
1.4.4	Agni, come for our worship. We choose Agni as our messenger. Agni is kindled by Agni. Agni has destroyed the foes. We praise Agni's praise. Agni, that mortal who worships you, these are the beginnings of those verses.
1.4.5	They become six.
1.4.6	There are six seasons.
1.4.7	He thus restores him to the seasons.
1.4.8	As he offers the Prajās and Anuyājas in the proper order,
1.4.9	so he does not go beyond the Prajās, Anuyājas.
1.4.10	The first portion of clarified butter is for the slaying of the demon;
1.4.11	and also he does not go beyong the Soma-pressing.
1.4.12	"One should awaken Agni with a hymn" - so says the Veda. One should do this first, says one.
1.4.13	Indeed, Agni is asleep for one who removes Agni.
1.4.14	He awakens him again with that.
1.4.15	The Vartraghna (hymn) indeed stands (in the proper place).
1.4.16	"O Agni, do thou purify the life-breaths" - this is the introductory verse of the northern (Samhita).
1.4.17	The Pavamāna is indeed the gentle form.
1.4.18	The sacrifice is indeed entirely Agni's.
1.4.19	When he recites the Pavamāna,
1.4.20	then his sacrifice becomes gentle.
1.5.1	The verses are the Yajya and Puronuvākyā.
1.5.2	The Paṅkti has five verses.
1.5.3	The sacrifice has five parts. For the attainment of the sacrifice.
1.5.4	They are interspersed.
1.5.5	The Prāṇas seem to be eating the Self.
1.5.6	All of them are performed with the Sāmīdha-bricks, silently, until the two fore-offerings.
1.5.7	For after this the offerings are distributed and poured out.
1.5.8	And all desires are in the distributions.
1.5.9	Therefore they are performed silently.
1.5.10	For the attainment of all desires.
1.5.11	He offers the high Anuyāja.
1.5.12	The high Sūktavāka and Uvakāvaha.
1.5.13	It is as if one were to make the lost visible.
1.5.14	Thus he makes the desires visible, as water.
1.5.15	Some perform the three in a low voice: the declensions, the northern half of the oblation.
1.5.16	It is enough to reach this much.
1.5.17	It is indeed spoken in the Upaṃśu form.
1.5.18	There are two forms of Agni, namely, Nirukta and Anirukta.
1.5.19	One attains that through that.
1.5.20	Some perform all rites related to Agni.
1.5.21	One should not do so.
1.5.22	The sacrifice is performed again for him who has been expelled, who has become old and decayed, who has been restored, who is a chariot, a bull, or gold, as the fee.
1.5.23	This is a rite of restoration.
1.5.24	The Adityas are the second.
1.5.25	Aditi is indeed the foundation.
1.5.26	By means of the foundation, by means of the foundation.
2.1.1	This is indeed the heat that is abandoned when one offers the Agnihotra.
2.1.2	That is indeed the heat which shines.
2.1.3	He indeed pleases him.
2.1.4	He offers it in the evening and in the morning.
2.1.5	To Agni in the evening and to Surya in the morning.
2.1.6	The day is solar, the night is Agni's.
2.1.7	He thus pleases the day and night with their own (proper) food.
2.1.8	One should offer with milk.
2.1.9	For milk is indeed the sap of all plants.
2.1.10	He thus satisfies the fires with all their sap.
2.1.11	They say, one should offer with food.
2.1.12	For all this food belongs to Agni.
2.1.13	He pleases the fires with their own food.
2.1.14	Having placed it on the Garhapatya, one should offer it on the Ahavaniya.
2.1.15	The Garhapatya is the burning.
2.1.16	The Ahavaniya is the kindling.
2.1.17	Therefore, having placed it on the Gārhapatya, he offers it on the Ahavanīya.
2.1.18	He makes the embers end in two.
2.1.19	He thus separates these two worlds.
2.1.20	Therefore, the two worlds are together and not different.
2.1.21	Now, when he illuminates after having placed (the oblations),
2.1.22	he indeed burns them.
2.1.23	And when he brings back the water,
2.1.24	the water indeed becomes all the oblations.
2.1.25	For the completeness of the oblation.
2.1.26	And when again he illuminates,
2.1.27	he indeed burns the water.
2.1.28	He throws the ashes three times towards the north, for the threefoldness.
2.1.29	The divine act is threefold.
2.1.30	One should take it without cutting off.
2.1.31	Thus the sacrificer becomes without loss.
2.1.32	Then he touches the embers on the right side with the Upavesa (mantra), "Salutations to the gods."
2.1.33	For the gods do not transgress the salutation.
2.1.34	One should remove the coals that have been well-kindled.
2.1.35	Thus, the one who is not engaged in the end does not perish.
2.2.1	One should offer four times.
2.2.2	This is the fourfold universe.
2.2.3	For the attainment of this entire universe.
2.2.4	One should make five offerings.
2.2.5	The sacrifice is fivefold; for the attainment of the sacrifice.
2.2.6	The Upasads should be known in the Agnihotra.
2.2.7-14	Having taken it up, he places it to the north of the Garhapatya. He attains this world. One who is going to offer on the Ahavaniya places the second Palasha twig as kindling-wood. Palasha is Soma. It is the first offering of Soma. It should be of the size of a span. The vital airs are of the size of the span above the body.
2.2.15	Having taken the sacrificial grass to a distance of two fingers, he offers it as if touching it.
2.2.16	The food for the mouth is placed at a distance of two finger-widths.
2.2.17	One should offer when the fire is smoking for one who desires a village.
2.2.18	When the fire is blazing, for one who desires brahminical splendour.
2.2.19	When the embers are glowing, for one who wishes for cattle.
2.2.20	One should say, "Having placed it down."
2.2.21	For here all these desires are fulfilled.
2.2.22	Having offered both oblations, he recites:
2.2.23	"May the blessing of the prosperous sacrifice be mine."
2.2.24	The blessing of the prosperous sacrifices belongs to the sacrificer.
2.2.25	One should offer the oblations in the reverse order.
2.2.26	One attains the heavenly worlds in an increasingly superior manner.
2.2.27	He touches the embers with the ladle.
2.2.28	He places the sacrificer in heaven itself.
2.3.1	He lifts up the ladle twice towards the north.
2.3.2	Having pleased Rudra in his own direction, he releases it.
2.3.3	Therefore one should not stand to the north of the burning fire.
2.3.4	So that one does not become a part of this entire god.
2.3.5	He cleans it towards the north in the evening, towards the west.
2.3.6	He thus sets the sun.
2.3.7	Towards the south, upwards, in the morning.
2.3.8	He thus raises the sun.
2.3.9	What he cleans first, he smears on the cushion.
2.3.10	He thus delights the plants.
2.3.11	What is the second, he places his hand stretched out towards the south of the cushion.
2.3.12	He thereby pleases the Pitrs.
2.3.13	Now, when he eats twice with the forefinger,
2.3.14	he pleases the embryos with the first (bite).
2.3.15	Therefore, embryos live without eating.
2.3.16	The old ones with the second.
2.3.17	Therefore, the old ones eat a little of everything and excrete like snow.
2.3.18	Now, why he eats with the ladle,
2.3.19	He pleases the gods of the past and the future.
2.3.20	Then when he cleans the ladle,
2.3.21	he pleases all the classes of gods.
2.3.22	Then when the ladle is wiped,
2.3.23	he pleases the classes of demons and gods.
2.3.24	Then he sprinkles water towards the east and the north,
2.3.25	he pleases Gandharvas and Apsarases.
2.3.26	Now when he directs the ladle towards the east and the west,
2.3.27	he places Rudra in his own direction.
2.3.28	Thus he pleases all beings with the Agnihotra.
2.4.1	Some say, one should offer on the Ahavaniya alone.
2.4.2	But one should offer on all.
2.4.3	For they are placed for the purpose of offering.
2.4.4	Four on the Garhapatya,
2.4.5	Four are in the Anvāhāryapacana.
2.4.6	Two are in the Āhavanīya.
2.4.7	They make ten.
2.4.8	The Viraj has ten tens.
2.4.9	The Viraja is prosperity, food.
2.4.10	For the attainment of prosperity and food.
2.4.11	He who offers the Agnihotra with the Viraj-complete oblations
2.4.12	attains all desires.
2.4.13	Now when he approaches the fires after having offered,
2.4.14	he thereby makes the gods satisfied and at the end (of the sacrifice) he speaks the purpose.
2.4.15	And when he touches the calf,
2.4.16	hence it is called Vatsapra.
2.4.17	Thus indeed, the cattle do not leave the sacrificer.
2.4.18	And when having sipped water, he releases the vow,
2.4.19	he thereby places the vow in the waters.
2.4.20	They protect his vow until the re-offering.
2.4.21	And when one is about to depart or has departed, he attends the fires.
2.4.22	This is a greeting to the deity, when it becomes visible.
2.4.23	And he thus gives himself over to the fires.
2.4.24	And to those who follow him.
2.4.25	Now, when he places the fire-wood on the two fire-sticks,
2.4.26	the fire-sticks are indeed the chariot of the gods,
2.4.27	he places them on the chariot of the god.
2.4.28	He attains heaven by this chariot of the gods.
2.4.29	And when he grinds again and again,
2.4.30	then his re-establishment becomes successful.
2.4.31	All pleasures, food, drink, and sexual intercourse,
2.4.32	They are made continuous by night.
2.4.33	Their night is the Karotara.
2.4.34	All the joys that there are,
2.5.1	they all arise from food.
2.5.2	The gods said:
2.5.3	"How can we obtain these joys from ourselves?"
2.5.4	They brought up the essence of water.
2.5.5	Those plants and trees came into being.
2.5.6	They brought the upward sap of the plants and trees.
2.5.7	That became fruit.
2.5.8	They brought upward the sap of the fruit.
2.5.9	That became food.
2.5.10	They brought upwards the sap of the food.
2.5.11	That became semen.
2.5.12	They brought up the sap of the semen.
2.5.13	He became a man.
2.5.14	This man breathes in and out.
2.5.15	He does not say, "I breathe in and out by means of the breath." He says, "I breathe and out."
2.5.16	He says it by means of speech.
2.5.17	Then the breath and out-breath become speech.
2.5.18	Then what one sees with the eye,
2.5.19	he does not say, "I see by means of the eye." He says, "I saw."
2.5.20	He says it through speech.
2.5.21-27	And that eye reaches speech, and becomes the realm of speech. Now what one hears with the ear, one does not say with the ear, 'I heard.' One says it with speech. And that ear reaches speech, and become the realm of speech.
2.5.28	He says it by speech.
2.5.29	The mind goes to speech, and becomes speech.
2.5.30	Now, when one touches a good or bad person with the limbs,
2.5.31	he does not say it by the limbs, but says, 'I touched a good or bad one.'
2.5.32	He says it by speech,
2.5.33	and the whole self goes to speech, becomes speech.
2.5.34	This is stated in a verse:
2.5.35	"There is no abode anywhere without Indra."
2.5.36	Speech is Indra.
2.5.37	For there is no abode anywhere apart from speech.
2.6.1	He offers in the evening, Agni is light, light is Agni.
2.6.2	He says that he who is light is light.
2.6.3	He speaks the truth.
2.6.4-10	His speech is the Self, made of truth. The gods are made of truth. Then he offers with "Svāhā." The gods accept that offering of his, made of truth, He speaks the truth at the end of the night. If he speaks a lie afterwards, His truth has been uttered.
2.6.11	He speaks the truth at night.
2.6.12	Then in the morning he offers with the verse, "The sun is light, light is the sun."
2.6.13	He says that the light is the truth.
2.6.14	He speaks the truth.
2.6.15	His self is truth.
2.6.16	The gods are truth.
2.6.17	Then he offers with "Svaha."
2.6.18	The gods accept this oblation of him who speaks the truth.
2.6.19	He speaks the truth at the beginning of the day.
2.6.20	If he speaks a lie afterwards,
2.6.21	it is as if he had spoken the truth.
2.6.22	For he speaks the truth at dawn.
2.6.23	This Agni, rising, offers himself to the sun.
2.6.24	He offers himself to Agni from the setting sun.
2.7.1	He offers himself to the sun from the night.
2.7.2	He offers the out-breath to the in-breath, and the in-breath to the out-breath.
2.7.3	These six offer themselves to one another.
2.7.4	He who knows these six offerings
2.7.5	his Agnihotra offering is offered even without offering.
2.7.6	When he offers, his offering is twice offered. He who knows thus.
2.7.7	If one who knows thus offers Agnihotra even from a small quantity of milk,
2.7.8	then the gods accept his offerings.
2.7.9	If the gods eat even once from him,
2.7.10	then he becomes immortal.
2.7.11	He who knows thus becomes one who is made of truth and immortality.
2.7.12	Just as the offering of one who has faith, is truthful, and is ascetic, is offered.
2.7.13	So also is his offering.
2.7.14	One who knows this offers the Agnihotra.
2.7.15	Therefore one who knows this should offer the Agnihotra.  
2.7.16	There is a debate whether the Agnihotra should be offered at sunrise or before sunrise.
2.8.1	One who offers at sunrise
2.8.2	He thus offers hospitality to the great god as soon as he is born.
2.8.3	Now he who offers at sunrise,
2.8.4	he offers hospitality to the present great god.
2.8.5	Therefore one should offer at sunrise.
2.8.6	Now Vrsha-Sushamas, a descendant of the Vata-avatas, saw the two oblations being offered in the night while he was lying down and said:
2.8.7-12	The two oblations are offered at night. "He said, "At night, indeed." "We shall be able to tell him when we go to the other world and to the fathers." "But those who do not believe in it will say, "It is not true." "If the Agnihotra is offered on both days, then it is offered on another day now."
2.8.13	The girl, who was possessed by Gandharva, said this much only.
2.8.14	They offer both oblations at night only.
2.8.15	She said, "At night only."
2.8.16	One should offer at the junction.
2.8.17	Indeed, this is the ocean, the all-taker, that is day and night.
2.8.18	Its depth is the junction.
2.8.19	Just as one would cross the ocean by means of two boats, so is it.
2.8.20	What one offers at the twilight.
2.8.21	Now this is indeed the army of the gods, which is about to destroy the travellers, namely, the day and night.
2.8.22	Now these are its wings, namely, the twilights.
2.8.23	Just as one would quickly proceed along the path by means of two wings, so is it
2.8.24	What one offers in the twilight.
2.8.25	Now, indeed, these two are the arms of Viraj, namely, day and night.
2.8.26	Just as one who is about to seize the arms of Virajj would be released in between, so is it.
2.8.27	When one offers at the junction.
2.9.1	Now, indeed, Kausitik said this:
2.9.2	One should offer at dusk before sunset, at that time.
2.9.3	That is the banner of the divine path.
2.9.4-10	Beginning with him, one goes to the heavenly world. One should offer at that time before sunrise, when darkness is removed. That is the auspicious banner of the gods. Beginning with him, one attains the heavenly world. Now, he who offers Agnihotra otherwise, Shama and Shabala laugh at him. Shabala is the day.
2.9.11	Night is dark.
2.9.12	He who offers at the great night,
2.9.13	the dark one destroys the Agnihotra.
2.9.14	And he who offers at the midday,
2.9.15	the weak one destroys the Agnihotr.
2.9.16	But if one were to offer at any time,
2.9.17	one would attain the prosperity of the offered oblations. One would attain the prosperity.
3.1.1	One observes fast on the days of the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices.
3.1.2	The gods do not eat the oblation of one who is not observing fast.
3.1.3	Therefore one observes fast.
3.1.4	"May the gods eat my oblation."
3.1.5	One should observe fast on the earlier full moon day, says Pingala.
3.1.6	One should observe on the later full moon day, say the Kauśītakas.
3.1.7	One should offer the oblation when the sun has set, says the settled view.
3.1.8	One should observe the fast on the full moon day, not knowing whether the new moon will be before or after.
3.1.9	By fasting one pleases the former (moon).
3.1.10	By sacrificing one pleases the latter.
3.1.11	One should observe the fast for the new moon.
3.1.12	The new moon indeed conquers the sea, and the moon is the deity.
3.1.13	This indeed is the truth of the gods, namely the moon.
3.1.14	Therefore one should observe the fast on the next day.
3.2.1	Now, when one recites the Sāmidhenī verses before the Agnihotra,
3.2.2	one makes it a means of well-being.
3.2.3	One recites the Sāmīdhēnī verses with the sound "hiṃ".
3.2.4	The sound "hiṃ" is the thunderbolt.
3.2.5	By means of the thunderbolt, one destroys the sin of the sacrificer.
3.2.6	One recits "hiṃ" three times.
3.2.7	The thunderbolt is threefold.
3.2.8	One accomplishes the thunderbolt.
3.2.9	By this very Trivrit Indra, the gods drove away the Asuras from these worlds.
3.2.10	In the same way the sacrificer drives away his enemies from these worlds by this very Trivrt Indra.
3.2.11	One should recite eleven Sāmidhenī verses.
3.2.12	The Tristubh metre has eleven syllables.
3.2.13	Indra is connected with the Tristubh metre.
3.2.14	He obtains both Indra and Agni.
3.2.15	Three times with the first (verse), three times with the last, making fifteen.
3.2.16	There are fifteen days in the bright and dark fortnights.
3.2.17	Thus he obtains the bright and dark fortnight with the Sāmidhenī verses.
3.2.18	Moreover, the Sāmidhēnī verses are the thunderbolt.
3.2.19	The thunderbolt is fifteenfold.
3.2.20	With the thunderbolt he indeed destroys the sin of the sacrificer.
3.2.21	That he recites three times the first and three times the last,
3.2.22	he indeed binds the sacrifice with the thread of the sacrifice for stability and non-slipping.
3.2.23	Of those (verses) there are three hundred and sixty syllables.
3.2.24	There are three hundred and six hundred days in a year.
3.2.25	He attains the days of the year with the Sāmidhenī verses.
3.2.26	They are in the Gāyatrī metre.
3.2.27	Agni is in the Gāyatra metre, the Gāyatrīs are the metres.
3.2.28	He praises Agni with its own metre.
3.2.29	They are similar.
3.2.30	What is similar at a sacrifice is prosperous. For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
3.2.31	In the third utterance to the supreme one, he concludes with the Pranava.
3.3.1	"Agni is great, you are Brahman, O Bharata."
3.3.2	Bharata is Agni.
3.3.3	He indeed carries the oblation to the gods.
3.3.4	And when he says what belongs to the sacrificer,
3.3.5	the gods do not eat the oblation of one who does not belong to the lineage.
3.3.6	Therefore he says what belongs
3.3.7	Then he recites this fifteen-syllabled verse, which is the Nigada.
3.3.8	This indeed is the Nigada of the Samidheni verses.
3.3.9	Therefore it has fifteen syllables.
3.3.10	For there are fifteen Samidheniverses.
3.3.11	It becomes without metres.
3.3.12	This whole world is twofold, with and without metres.
3.3.13	One should praise Agni with all that.
3.3.14	He should offer seven steps for the one who has a problem.
3.3.15	There are seven kinds of meters.
3.3.16	For the attainment of all meters.
3.3.17	Then four, then four.
3.3.18	This is the fourfold universe.
3.3.19	For the sake of attaining this entire universe.
3.3.20	Then when he invokes the deities in a scattered manner,
3.3.21	because the oblations for them have been taken separately.
3.3.22	Therefore he invokes the deity with a special invocation.
3.3.23	Now, when he invokes Agni with Agni,
3.3.24	this is Agni's sacrificial form, which is his fire-pit.
3.3.25	It is that which shines above this sun, like light in the sky.
3.3.26	When he says, "Agni, invoke Agni,"
3.3.27	he means, "Invoke her."
3.3.28	Now when he invokes the deities who are to be offered with clarified butter,
3.3.29	he invokes the Prayāja and Anuyāja offerings.
3.3.30	And when he invokes Agni as the Hotṛ,
3.3.31	he invokes Svishtakṛt.
3.3.32	And when one invokes one's own greatness,
3.3.33	he invokes Vāyu.
3.3.34	For Vāyu is Agni's own greatness.
3.4.1	For by it one attains greatness.
3.4.2	Whatever he recites with speech, he sacrifices with speech.
3.4.3	By that indeed his own greatness is accomplished.
3.4.4	He says, "O Jātavedas, do bring (the gods) and do sacrifice with the good-yoked ones."
3.4.5	He says to him, "Do bring the gods and do sacrifice with good-yoked deities."
3.4.6	Then what he murmurs after the Sāmidhenī verses,
3.4.7	The Sāmidhenīs are indeed the thunderbolt.
3.4.8	He thus appeases him in front and above.
3.4.9	And when he pours water into the ladle with the ladle,
3.4.10	he yokes the divine chariot. He who is about to offer oblation to the gods,
3.4.11	he attains heaven by this divine chariot.
3.4.12	He offers the Prayāja offerings.
3.4.13	The Prayāja offerings are the seasons.
3.4.14	He thus pleases the seasons.
3.4.15	They are five in number.
3.4.16	Whatever is fivefold in the divine and the individual, all that he obtains.
3.4.17	He offers the Samidh-oblations; he obtains the spring.
3.4.18	In spring everything here is kindled.
3.4.19	He offers Tanunapat; he obtains the summer.
3.4.20	For in summer one burns up the body.
3.4.21	He offers Ida; he obtains the rainy season.
3.4.22	For the food is obtained by means of the seasons.
3.4.23	He offers on the sacrificial grass, for the autumn.
3.4.24	For in autumn the plants are most abundant.
3.4.25	He offers the final oblation in the form of svāhā, for the winter.
3.4.26	For in winter everything here is in the form of svaha.
3.4.27	They say, "The five Prayājas are five, the seasons are six. Where does he offer the sixth season?"
3.4.28	When he brings the fourth Prayāja to the same place, he distributes it among the others.
3.5.1	And when he pours the deities into the last Prayāja,
3.5.2	he makes them share in the Prayājas.
3.5.3	Just as fire is a sharer in all the oblations,
3.5.4	so the deities are sharers in that share of Agni.
3.5.5	Here one does not say, "Agni is the Hotr."
3.5.6	The Prayājas are indeed animals.
3.5.7	Svishtakrit is Rudra.
3.5.8	One does not say this lest Rudra should take away the sacrificer's animals.
3.5.9	"Svāhā! The gods who drink the ghee, Agni, do you enjoy the ghee!" Some say this.
3.5.10	One should not do so.
3.5.11	Half of the sacrifice is ghee, half is oblation.
3.5.12	If one were to say anything other than that,
3.5.13	half of the sacrifice would be incomplete, half would be complete.
3.5.14-18	Therefore, one should say, "O Agni, do thou partake of the oblation of ghee." Now, why are the two oblations of ghee offered to Indra and Agni on the full-moon day? Indra killed Vritra with the full-moon sacrifice. And why are the two offerings to Indra and Agni for growth on the new-moon day? Here the moon wanes.
3.5.19	He thus nourishes and increases him.
3.6.1	They are offered with the Jushana-verse.
3.6.2	For the offerings are equal in the Prayajas.
3.6.3	And the Jushana is indeed Brahman.
3.6.4	He thus offers the oblation to the gods through Brahman.
3.6.5	They are both offered with the Trivrit-verse.
3.6.6	The Yajamaha is the Nigada, the Vasat-call.
3.6.7	The eye is the two portions of clarified butter.
3.6.8	The eye is threefold: white, black and red.
3.6.9	He does not perform them at the animal sacrifice or at the Soma sacrifice.
3.6.10	The animal sacrifice is for the one who has eyes.
3.6.11	"One should not make the sacrifice hideous with four eyes."
3.6.12	And when the invitatory verses are uttered, the offering verses are uttered.
3.6.13	The invitatory verses are spoken, the offering verses spoken.
3.6.14-20	Having become that, he offers the oblation to the gods. They are Gāyatrī and Tristubh verses. Brahman is Gāyatrī. Kṣatriya is Tristubh. By means of Brahman and Kṣatriya, he offers the offering to the gods. He makes the Vasat call at the end of the Rk. Thus all his Yajyas become endowed with form.
3.6.21	He makes the offering with six "Vasat" - sounds.
3.6.22	There are six seasons.
3.6.23	He thus pleases the seasons.
3.7.1	One should make the offering with the "Vasat" sound of the Barhaspatya Rathantara, long in front and short afterwards.
3.7.2	What is short is the Rathantara.
3.7.3	What is long is the Brihat.
3.7.4	This (earth) is the Rathantara, that (sky) is the Brihat.
3.7.5-10	It is on these two that it is established. Now this is the extent of the modification of speech. He offers oblation to the gods with the entire modification of speech. He recites "bhūr bhuvaḥ" before the Yejamāha. He recites after the Vasat-call, "Ojas, strength, strength, Ojas, heaven." The Vasat-call is indeed the thunderbolt.
3.7.11	He thus appeases him in front and above.
3.7.12	And these two are the most beloved forms of the Vasat-call, namely, strength and power.
3.7.13	He thus appeases him by means of them.
3.7.14	And why he offers Agni first among the deities,
3.7.15	Agni is the mouth of the gods.
3.7.16	He thus pleases the gods by means of the mouth.
3.7.17	Now, when he offers to Agni and Soma on the full-moon day,
3.7.18	Agni and Soma were within Vritra.
3.7.19	Indra was not able to strike with the thunderbolt.
3.7.20	When he offers in a low voice, thereby he pleases Soma;
3.7.21	when he offers in a loud voice, thereby he delights Agni.
3.8.1	Now, when he offers Indra and Agni on the new-moon day,
3.8.2	Or, when he offers to Indra and Agni in the Pratiṣṭhā rite, it is for stability.
3.8.3	And when he offers to the united Indra, it is for the great Indra.
3.8.4	This is the light of the new moon.
3.8.5	For the moon is not seen here.
3.8.6	And when, without uniting, he offers the oblations with the Ajya in between, it is for immortality.
3.8.7-12	Now as to why he offers the Upāṁśu-oblation between the Sānāyya and the Saṁnāyya, the Brāhmaṇa text has explained this. Now as to why he makes the Agni-Svishtakṛt offering at the end. He indeed offers the oblation to the gods. He who distributes the food, he distributes it at the end. And Rudra is the Svishtakṛt. He is the one who gets the last portion.
3.8.13	Therefore he offers it at the end.
3.8.14	The two verses of the Yajus and Puronuvākyā are recited in that order.
3.8.15	By that one becomes free from disease.
3.8.16	He touches the water with the Vasat-utterance.
3.8.17	Water is indeed peace and healing.
3.8.18	This peace and healing is done at the sacrifice.
3.8.19	And when he anoints the lower lip with the Iḍā-offering,
3.9.3	Now, indeed, Ida is food.
3.9.4	He places food in himself.
3.9.5	Now, indeed, Ida are cattle.
3.9.6	For the attainment of cattle.
3.9.7	In it there are four.
3.9.8	Thus it becomes five-footed.
3.9.9	The five-footed one is the Pankti.
3.9.10	The sacrifice is five-fold. For the attainment of the sacrifice.
3.9.11	Now, when he eats the northern Ida with muttering,
3.9.12	The muttering of the Veda is indeed Brahman.
3.9.13	He appeases it with Brahman itself.
3.9.14	And when the Adhvaryu makes the sacrificial cake on the sacrificial grass,
3.9.15	he thereby pleases the Pitrs.
3.9.16	And when they sprinkle with the Pavitra,
3.9.17	water is indeed the remedy for peace.
3.9.18	This is indeed the remedy of peace that is done at the sacrifice.
3.9.19	Then why they bring the Anvāhārya (rice-ball)?
3.9.20	The Darsha-Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices are on the right side.
3.9.21	Therefore they bring it.
3.9.22	Then why he recites over the Samit?
3.9.23	This is the only remnant of the kindling wood.
3.9.24	Therefore he recites over it.
3.10.1	Then, why he offers three Anuyājas?
3.10.2	These are the three worlds.
3.10.3	He obtains these very worlds.
3.10.4	Now, whatever is the best, he says.
3.10.5	The Svishtakrit is indeed the foundation. By means of the foundation,
3.10.6	Now, whatever he says in praise,
3.10.7	The praise is indeed the foundation, by means of the foundation.
3.10.8	Now, when he praises heaven and earth,
3.10.9	Heaven and earth are indeed the foundation, through the foundation.
3.10.10	Agni has enjoyed this oblation, some say.
3.10.11	One should not do so.
3.10.12	The deity turns back, thinking that the sacrifice is being repeated.
3.10.13	"He will give me the oblation again."
3.10.14	She turns back the blessing of the sacrificer when he says, "This oblation."
3.10.15	Therefore one should say, "The oblation has been enjoyed, the oblation has been well enjoyed."
3.10.16	Now, indeed, those very deities for whom he offers in front,
3.10.17	he thereby stands firm at the end with them.
3.10.18	And when he takes the name of the sacrificer in the Sūktavāk,
3.10.19	this indeed is the divine self of the sacrificer which the priests consecrate.
3.10.20	Therefore he takes his name.
3.10.21	For here he is born.
3.10.22	If the teacher is present, one should take it loudly.
3.10.23	Thus the sacrificer becomes free from loss.
3.10.24	Then they recite five benedictions in the Ida. There are three of them, making eight.
3.10.25	The gods attained all the eight directions through these.
3.10.26	In the same way, the sacrificer attains all the eight directions.
3.10.27	Then, having placed the palms of his hands facing east on the sacrificial grass, he mutters, "I approach with salutations."
3.10.28	For the gods do not transgress the salutation.
3.10.29	Then, when he speaks the words of Shamyu,
3.10.30	Shamyu's words are indeed a foundation. By means of the foundation,
3.10.31	And Shamyu, being connected with Brihaspati, pacified all the sacrifices.
3.10.32	Therefore he speaks the words "Shamyu".
3.10.33	Now, why does he sprinkle water?
3.10.34	Water is indeed a remedy for peace.
3.10.35	This peace and remedy is indeed performed at the sacrifice.
3.11.1	Now, why do they perform the Patnīsaṃyājas at the Garhapatya?
3.11.2	The wives are the sharers of the Garhapaty.
3.11.3	The sacrificer is the sharer of the Ahavanīya.
3.11.4	Therefore they perform the Patnīsāmayājas at the Garhapati.
3.11.5	They are four in number.
3.11.6	The four are a pair, a couple, for procreation, for propagation.
3.11.7	They are performed in a low voice.
3.11.8	The Patnisamyaja offerings are the pouring of semen.
3.11.9	Semen is poured in a low voice
3.11.10	They are performed with similar verses.
3.11.11	What is similar at a sacrifice is prosperous. For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
3.11.12	Then Soma, Tvashtri, the wives of the gods, Agni, the lord of the house.
3.11.13	These indeed are the deities who rule over the pairs.
3.11.14	They delight them here.
3.11.15	They give them pairs, being pleased with him.
3.12.1	He first sacrifices to Soma.
3.12.2	He sprinkles semen there.
3.12.3	Tvashtri is the second.
3.12.4	Tvashtra indeed shapes the semen that has been sprinkled.
3.12.5	Then the wives.
3.12.6	For these are the offerings to the wives.
3.12.7	Then why does he offer to Agni, the householder, at the end?
3.12.8	This is the Svishtakrit of the wives.
3.12.9	Therefore he offers to him at the end.
3.12.10	Then why she touches the water, the meaning of that has been explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
3.12.11	Then why he mutters a verse, he makes it auspicious.
3.12.12	Now, as for why he invokes Ila, why he cleanses, and why he says the Shamyovaak, the Brahmaṇa has been explained.
3.12.13	Now, as for why the Veda recites the wife.
3.12.14	The Veda is indeed the male.
3.12.15	The wife is the female.
3.12.16	He thus places the union in the wives.
3.12.17	Therefore the wife puts the Veda-grass between her thighs.
3.12.18	Now, when he strews the Veda,
3.12.19	then his Darsha-Pūrnamāsa sacrifices become continuous.
3.12.20	And by this very (act) his Agnihotra becomes performed on a strewed (sacrificial) grass.
3.12.21	And when he stands over the Veda which is left over,
3.12.22	he then utters a blessing.
3.12.23	And when (the Adhvaryu) stands over the Ahavaniya,
3.12.24	he then, having pleased the gods, at the end utters the purpose.
3.12.25	Now, why he sprinkles water.
3.12.26	Water is indeed a remedy for peace.
3.12.27	This is indeed the remedy for peace that is done at the end of the sacrifice, that is done at its end.
4.1.1	The gods indeed killed the Asuras by means of the Anunirvapya.
4.1.2	In the same way, the sacrificer here kills his enemies by means of the anunirvapya.
4.1.3	He offers to Indra the cake on eleven potsherds.
4.1.4	Indra is the destroyer of enemies.
4.1.5	He destroys his enemies.
4.1.6	And also, when he offers to Indra at the Full Moon, he takes back the New Moon.
4.1.7	If the sacrificer were to be deprived of the New and Full Moon sacrifices, he would be deprived of the sacrifice.
4.1.8	His sacrifice would not be drawn out.
4.1.9	Now, when he offers to Aditi on the new moon day,
4.1.10	it is for the sake of the sacrifice being drawn out.
4.1.11	It becomes less than the Samyagya.
4.2.1	Now, about the one who has risen.
4.2.2	He indeed goes away from the path of sacrifice,
4.2.3	of him whose moon is seen before the Upavasatha day.
4.2.4	He offers a cake on eight potsherds to Agni Datra.
4.2.5	Agni is the giver.
4.2.6	He himself gives him the sacrifice.
4.2.7	To Indra Pradatra, he offers curds churned in the evening.
4.2.8	Indra is the giver. He himself gives him the
4.2.9	sacrifice.
4.2.10	To Vishnu Sipivishta, he offers rice cooked in milk churned in the morning.
4.2.11	Vishnu is the sacrifice.
4.2.12	He himself gives him the sacrifice.
4.2.13	That he goes to these deities,
4.2.14	(it is) so that he does not go away from the path of sacrifice.
4.2.15	The fee is three bows.
4.2.16	That is the form of the auspicious journey.
4.3.1	Now, then, about the one who has seen the moon.
4.3.2	He indeed goes away from the path to sacrifice,
4.3.3	whose moon is seen after the day of fasting.
4.3.4	He offers a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, the path-maker.
4.3.5	Agni is the path-maker;
4.3.6	he alone makes him fall back on the path of sacrifice.
4.3.7	To Indra, the slayer of Vrtra, on eleven potsherds.
4.3.8	Indra is the slayer of Vrtr;
4.3.9	he alone again makes him fall back onto the path of sacrifice;
4.3.10	To Vaisvānara, on twelve potsherds;
4.3.11	He is indeed the all-pervading fire, who shines thus.
4.3.12	He again puts him on the path of sacrifice.
4.3.13	That he offers these deities,
4.3.14	(thinking) 'May I not go away from the path of sacrifice.'
4.3.15	The gift is a stick and sandals.
4.3.16	That is the form of safety.
4.4.1	Now, then, about the Dakshayana sacrifice.
4.4.2	He who is going to perform the Dakṣāyaṇa sacrifice, performs it on the full moon day of Phālguna.
4.4.3	Phālguna full moon day is the face of the year.
4.4.4	Therefore, rites are performed on that day for those who are not initiated.
4.4.5	And Dakṣa, the son of Parvati, having performed this sacrifice, obtained all his desires.
4.4.6	Therefore, he who performs the Dakṣāyaṇayajña,
4.4.7	for the attainment of all desires.
4.4.8	One should eat the food with the desire to destroy.
4.4.9	One should think in one's mind, "I am eating Soma, the king, the moon," and then eat.
4.4.10	That is indeed Soma, the king of the moon, the discerning one.
4.4.11	The gods drink him in this dark fortnight.
4.4.12	That is why they perform the observances of the Dakshayani sacrifice in the dark fortnight.
4.4.13	He becomes a drinker of Soma even of the gods.
4.4.14	Now, why he offers the cake on eleven potsherds to Agni-Soma on the Upavasatha day.
4.4.15	It is the cake to Agni-Soma which is offered on the Upavaṭha day of Soma.
4.4.16	He obtains it by that.
4.4.17	And why he offers the New-Moon sacrifice in the morning.
4.4.18	The day of the full moon is connected with Indra.
4.4.19	He obtains the good day.
4.4.20	Now, when he offers the cake on twelve potsherds to Indra-Agni on the Upavasatha day of the new moon,
4.4.21	the third pressing is indeed Indra-Agni.
4.4.22	He obtains the third pressing.
4.4.23	Now, the Payasyā to Mitra-Varuna,
4.4.24	the Anubandhya is indeed Mitra-Varuna.
4.4.25	He obtains Anubandhya.
4.4.26	This Soma, indeed, has entered the sacrificial rites.
4.4.27	Therefore, one who is not initiated should observe the vow of one who is initiated.
4.5.1	Now, indeed, about the Iḍā-addition.
4.5.2	One who desires to perform the Iḍā addition should perform it on this very full-moon day. Its Brāhmaṇa has been stated.
4.5.3	This sacrifice is for one who desires cattle and food.
4.5.4	One who is desirous of cattle and food should perform it.
4.5.5	There he performs the same rites.
4.5.6	This is the summary of the Dakṣāyaṇa sacrifice.
4.5.7	Now, here is the Sārvaseṇiya sacrifice.
4.5.8	One who desires to perform the Sārvseṇiya sacrifice should perform it on this very full moon day. Its Brāhmaṇa has been stated.
4.5.9	This is indeed the sacrifice for one who desires to prosper.
4.5.10	One who wishes to afflict his enemy, the adversary, should perform it.
4.5.11	He conquers with this sacrifice.
4.5.12	Now, about the Saunakiya sacrifice.
4.5.13	One who desires to perform the Saunakiy sacrifice should perform it on this very full-moon day. Its Brāhmaṇa has been recited.
4.5.14	This is the sacrifice for one who desires offspring.
4.5.15	One who wishes for offspring should perform it.
4.5.16	When the Adhvaryu generates the oblations, that is the form of offspring.
4.6.1	Now, then, of the Vasishtha sacrifice.
4.6.2	One who wishes to perform the Vasishtha rite performs it on the new moon day in the month of Phalguna.
4.6.3	The full moon is indeed Brahman.
4.6.4	The new moon is indeed the Kshatriya.
4.6.5	This sacrifice is indeed like the Kshatriya,
4.6.6	(saying) "With the Kshatriya one conquers enemies."
4.6.7	Vasishtha, whose sons were killed, desired, 'May I beget offspring and cattle and become superior to the Saudāsa.'
4.6.8	He saw this sacrifice, the Vasishtha sacrifice.
4.6.9	Having performed it, he begot offspring and cattle and became superior to the Saudāsas.
4.6.10	In the same way, the sacrificer, when he performs the Vasishtha-sacrifice,
4.6.11	He is born with offspring and cattle, and becomes superior to his enemies.
4.6.12	Now, then, about the one who goes together.
4.6.13	One who desires to go together should perform this rite on the new moon day. Its Brāhmaṇa has been stated.
4.6.14	This is the sacrifice for one who desires supremacy and masculinity.
4.6.15	One who is desirous of supremacy and masculinity performs this sacrifice.
4.6.16	Because they are established together.
4.6.17	They offer together.
4.6.18	They consume together.
4.6.19	Therefore, one should go together.
4.7.1	Now, about the Munyayana.
4.7.2	One who wishes to perform the Munyayana should perform it on this very full moon day. Its Brāhmaṇa has been spoken.
4.7.3	This indeed is the sacrifice of all desires.
4.7.4	One should perform it for all desires.
4.7.5	Now, then, of the Turayaṇa.
4.7.6	One who is going to perform the Turayaṇa rite performs it on this very full-moon day. Its Brāhmaṇa has been stated.
4.7.7	This indeed is the sacrifice for one desiring heaven.
4.7.8	He indeed makes his own self complete by means of Brahman.
4.7.9	There are three oblations.
4.7.10	These indeed are the three worlds.
4.7.11	He indeed attains these worlds.
4.8.1	Now, then, about the Āgrayaṇa.
4.8.2	One who desires food should offer the Āgrayaṇeṣṭi when the Śyāmāka crop has been harvested in the rainy season.
4.8.3	One should harvest the Śyāmākās.
4.8.4	The new moon that occurs at that time.
4.8.5	Having performed the new moon sacrifice, one should then perform this sacrifice.
4.8.6	If it is the full moon.
4.8.7	Having performed this sacrifice, one should perform the full moon sacrifice.
4.8.8	If one desires a constellation.
4.8.9	In the case of the former option, one should gaze at the constellation and perform the sacrifice in the auspicious constellation that one desires.
4.8.10	For it, there are seventeen Samidhenī verses, the two Ajyabhāgas ending with the word "sada", the two Viraj verses as Samyājyā. The Brāhmaṇa for it has been stated.
4.8.11	A cake on eight potsherds to Soma.
4.8.12	Soma is indeed the king of plants.
4.8.13	He pleases him with his own direction.
4.8.14	Then why does he offer the Madhuparka?
4.8.15	This is indeed the juice of the forest.
4.9.1	Then when spring has come and the bamboo shoots have ripened,
4.9.2	he says to harvest the bamboo shoots.
4.9.3	This is its very occasion, this is its procedure, this is its deity, this is its fee, this is its Brahmanical formula.
4.9.4	Some perform it as belonging to Agni, some as belonging to Varuna, some as belonging as belonging to Prajapati. This is the proper procedure.
4.9.5	Then when the barley or the wheat is ripe, he should say:
4.9.6	"Let the grains be taken from the Aggrayanîya heap."
4.9.7	This is the proper procedure for that.
4.9.8	Then as for the twelve-pot Indra-Agni offering,
4.9.9-15	Indra and Agni are the mouth of the gods. He thus pleases the gods through the mouth itself. And as for the oblation to all the gods, all the gods are indeed all the gods. It is for the sake of pleasing all the gods. And as for the oblations to heaven and earth, Heaven and earth are the providers of grain.
4.9.16	Earth is the foundation, the Oṃ is the support. It follows.
4.9.17	When he offers to these deities,
4.9.18	he thinks, "I shall eat food sanctified by these deities."
4.10.1	Then when he gives a cow as the first gift,
4.10.2	it is the first rite.
4.10.3	If this cow were to die,
4.10.4	one should offer a sacrifice on the full moon or new moon day for the sake of the nine, for the attainment of both.
4.10.5	Or, at the full moon or new moon, he may offer oblations to the gods, so that they may not be deprived.
4.10.6	Or, in the evening and morning, he may offer Agnihotra with barley-gruel, for the attainment of both the worlds.
4.10.7	Or else, having cooked the meal in the Gārhapatya, he should offer it to the nine deities of the Āgrayaṇa in the Āhavanīya, with the fourth Svishtakṛt, saying, "To such and such a deity svāhā, to such and such a svāhā," for the non-deprivation of the deities.
4.10.8	Or, having taken a new cow, one should offer the Agnihotra with her milk in the evening and morning for the attainment of both.
4.10.9	These are the only offerings.
4.10.10	One should offer to whichever one one desires.
4.10.11	But the three-offering is established.
4.10.12	For these are the three worlds.
5.1.6	As the beginning and end of a year are joined together,
5.1.7	so are the beginning and end joined together in the year.
5.1.8	If one were to offer the Vaishvadev sacrifice on the full moon day of Phalguna,
5.1.9	one would please the year from the beginning.
5.1.10	And the Caturmasya sacrifices are indeed healing sacrifices.
5.1.11	Therefore, they are performed at the junctions of the seasons.
5.1.12	Diseases occur at the junctions of seasons.
5.1.13	There are eight oblations.
5.1.14	There are oblations for the four full-moon days.
5.1.15	The Vaiśvadeva is the combination of the four full-moons.
5.1.16	Now when Agni is kindled,
5.1.17	Prajapati is the Vaiśvadeva.
5.1.18	Therefore they generate this divine embryo.
5.1.19	Now as for the seventeen Sāmidhenī verses, the two Ajyabhāga verses, the two Samyājyā verses, the Brāhmaṇa text relating to them has been explained.
5.1.20	Now as to why there are nine Prayāja offerings, nine Anuyāja offerings, eight oblations, and the Vājinī is the ninth,
5.1.21	one attains the Viraj consisting of the stars.
5.2.1	Now, why he offers to Agni and Soma as the first deities?
5.2.2	These are the deities of the New and Full Moon sacrifices.
5.2.3	Therefore he offers to them as the first.
5.2.4	Now, why he offers (to Savitr)?
5.2.5	Savitr is the lord of all that is born.
5.2.6	For the purpose of being born by Savitr.
5.2.7	Now, what is the reason for offering to Sarasvati?
5.2.8	Sarasvati is speech.
5.2.9	He thereby pleases speech.
5.2.10	And why he offers to Pusan,
5.2.11	Pusan is that one who shines.
5.2.12	He thereby pleases him.
5.2.13	And why the Maruts, the self-luminous ones, are offered to,
5.2.14	The Maruts, the Self-luminous Ones, are terrible.
5.2.15	He thereby performs a remedy.
5.2.16	And why there is the Payasya offering to the All-goddesses,
5.2.17	These are all the gods, namely the All-gods.
5.2.18	For the satisfaction of all the gods.
5.2.19	And why there is a single-pot offering to Heaven and Earth,
5.2.20	Heaven and Earth are indeed the foundation; it is for the foundation.
5.2.21	And why he gives a cow as the first gift,
5.2.22	Because this is the first rite.
5.2.23	Now, when he offers the Vājinī verses before or after the Samyu, or when he offers the horse-sacrifices,
5.2.24	the Vājinī horses are indeed the gods.
5.2.25	He thus delights them.
5.2.26	Here the gods with their horses are delighted.
5.2.27	And the Vājinīs are indeed the seasons.
5.2.28	He thus pleases the seasons.
5.2.29	And when he offers the Full-moon sacrifice afterwards,
5.2.30	Thus, in the case of the Hāsa, the offering is made with the Vaiśvadeva rite.
5.3.1	Prajapati created beings with the Vaiśvadeva rite.
5.3.2	Those created beings ate the barley of Varuna without giving birth.
5.3.3	Varuna released them with the noose of Varuna.
5.3.4	Those beings approached their father Prajapati and ran to him.
5.3.5	"Know that sacrifice, by which having worshipped, we may be released from the noose of Varuna and from all sin."
5.3.6	Then Prajapati saw this sacrifice, the Varunapraghasa.
5.3.7	He brought it, and worshipped with it.
5.3.8	Having worshipped with it, he pleased Varuna.
5.3.9	He, being pleased, released the creatures from the noose of Varuna and from all sin.
5.3.10	He, indeed, whose progeny is released from the noose and from all sin, knows thus.
5.4.1	Now, when they carry Agni,
5.4.2	they carry him who is churned in the Vaisvadeva (rite).
5.4.3	They carry him.
5.4.4-7	Now, as for the churning, its Brāhmaṇa has been recited. Now, as for the seventeen Sāmidhenī verses, the two concluding portions of clarified butter, the two Virājas, and the Samyājyā, its Brāhmanical text has been recited. Now, as for nine Prayāja offerings, nine Anuyāja offerings, and these nine oblations, one attains the Viraj consisting of the Naksatras.
5.5.4	Indra is Varuna.
5.5.5	He is the one who drinks milk.
5.5.6	Therefore, the Payasya is dedicated to Varuna.
5.5.7	Now, why the Payasya to Maruts?
5.5.8	The Maruts are settled in the waters.
5.5.9	Therefore, he offers the Payasya for them.
5.5.10	For water is milk.
5.5.11	And the Maruts are of Indra.
5.5.12	Milk is of Indra.
5.5.13	Therefore, Payasya is offered to Maruts.
5.5.14	Now, the single-pot offering to Ka is
5.5.15	Prajapati is indeed the one who is.
5.5.16	He indeed pleases him.
5.5.17	And also, this is the name of happiness, namely, "Ka."
5.5.18	He indeed places happiness in himself.
5.5.19	And then, when he gives a pair of cows,
5.5.20	That is the form for progeny.
5.5.21	And then when he sacrifices to Vayu,
5.5.22	Their Brāhmaṇa has been spoken.
5.5.23	And then if he sacrifices to Varuna in water,
5.5.24	He thus pleases him in his own abode.
5.5.25	Now, when he performs the Full-moon sacrifice afterwards,
5.5.26	then his offering with the Varuna-grahas on the preceding half-moon becomes proper.
5.6.1	The Sākamedha is indeed a sacrifice of Indra.
5.6.2	Just as a great king, having arranged his army in front, would go along the path without fear,
5.6.3	In the same way, he offers to the deities in front.
5.6.4	Just as Soma is the great vow,
5.6.5	in the same way, this Iṣṭi is the great vow.
5.6.6	Now, when he offers to Agni with the Anīkavants, the first of the deities,
5.6.7	Agni is the face of the gods.
5.6.8	He thus pleases the gods with their face.
5.6.9	Now, why he offers to the Maruts at midday?
5.6.10	At midday the sun burns.
5.6.11	Therefore he offers to the Matuts at midday.
5.6.12	And also because the Maruts are of Indra.
5.6.13	Midday is of Indra.
5.6.14	Therefore he makes offerings to the Maruts.
5.6.15	And why they perform the Gṛhamedhi rite in the evening,
5.6.16	The Gṛhamedhiyas are indeed the rites of nourishment.
5.6.17	In the evening, one nourishes.
5.6.18	Therefore, the Ajyabhāgas are performed after the Pūṣanvantas.
5.6.19	He nourishes the sacrificer himself.
5.6.20	Then, when they perform with the full pot in the morning,
5.6.21	It is as if he continues the morning rite with the rite of the previous day.
5.7.1	Then, why does one perform the sacrifice to the playful Maruts?
5.7.2	The Maruts are the playmates of Indra.
5.7.3	Therefore he offers them to Indra.
5.7.4	And why he offers Mahendra at the end,
5.7.5	the chief one takes the end.
5.7.6	Therefore he makes him offer at the end.
5.7.7	And why they lead Agni forward, and why it is churned, the Brāhmaṇa has been explained.
5.7.8	Now as to why there are seventeen kindling verses, two portions of clarified butter at the end, two Virājas, and two Samyājas, the Brāhmaṇa has been explained.
5.7.9	Now as to why there is nine Prayājas, nine Anuyājas, eight oblations, and the Sviṣṭakṛt as the ninth,
5.7.10	he attains the Viraj of the stars.
5.7.11-16	The six oblations are equal, ending with Indra-Agni and beginning with Varuna. The Brāhmaṇa concerning them has been recited. Now as to why one offers to Mahendra, the Brāhmaṇa has been recited. Now as to why one makes an offering to Visvakarman on one potsherd. He who shines is indeed Visvakarman. One thus pleases him.
5.7.17	Now, why does he give the bull?
5.7.18	For the sacrifice is Indra's.
5.8.1	Now, why do they perform the Pitryajña in the afternoon?
5.8.2	The Pitrs are the receivers of the waning half.
5.8.3	Therefore they perform the Pitr-yajña in the evening.
5.8.4	They say, "If the Pitrs are the recipients of the waning half, why do they worship them in the bright half?"
5.8.5	The Fathers are indeed the gods.
5.8.6	Therefore they are worshipped on the fore-side.
5.8.7	And when he recites one kindling verse,
5.8.8	it is as if the Fathers were once.
5.8.9	Therefore he recites one (kindling verse).
5.8.10	It becomes the Anushtubh (metre).
5.8.11	The Anushtubh is speech.
5.8.12	The Fathers are indeed the distant ones.
5.8.13	He thus makes them enter into the Anushtubb of speech.
5.8.14	Then, why does he not recite the verse of the sacrificer?
5.8.15	"So that he does not injure the sacrificer."
5.8.16	Then he recites this verse. Its significance has been explained.
5.8.17	Then, why does he invite the Soma-possessed ancestors or the ancestors of Soma-possessed ones, the ancestors seated on the sacrificial grass, the ancestors of Agni-Svāttā?
5.8.18	These are the divine ancestors.
5.8.19	Therefore he invokes them.
5.8.20	Now, why he invokes Agni Kavya-vahana,
5.8.21	The Fathers are indeed the Sviṣṭakṛt.
5.8.22	Therefore he invokes him.
5.8.23	Some do not invoke their own greatness, saying, "This is the greatness of the sacrificer."
5.8.24	One should invoke, indeed, this is the settled view.
5.8.25	For this is the greatness of Agni.
5.8.26	Now, why the oblations at the Prajās are without sacrificial grass?
5.8.27	Sacrificial grass is progeny.
5.8.28	One should win progeny by that.
5.8.29	They are six in number.
5.8.30	There are six seasons.
5.8.31	The seasons are the fathers.
5.8.32	One thus pleases the fathers.
5.8.33	Now, why the two Ajyabhāga oblations are without life?
5.8.34	He thus revives the sacrificer.
5.8.35	Now, why there are three each for each oblation,
5.8.36	there are three oblations.
5.8.37	He divides them.
5.8.38	Therefore there are three each of each oblation.
5.8.39	And also he turns away the rite of the dead by the rite of the gods.
5.8.40	Then the Fathers have gone to the other world.
5.8.41	He calls them with the first (verse).
5.8.42	With the second he invites them.
5.8.43	With the third he gives them the food.
5.9.1	And why he offers to Agni Kavya-vahana at the end,
5.9.2	The Fathers are indeed the Sviṣṭakṛt.
5.9.3	Therefore he offers to him at the end.
5.9.4	Now, as for the sprinkling of water, the Brāhmaṇa text on that has been explained.
5.9.5	Now, as for not eating after having called out to Ida and having sniffed at it,
5.9.6	Ida is indeed cattle.
5.9.7	"One should not let the cattle of the sacrificer be destroyed."
5.9.8	Now, as the Adhvaryu gives to the Pitrs,
5.9.9	he thereby pleases the Pitrs.
5.9.10	Now as to why they sprinkle with Pavitras, the Brāhmaṇa text has explained this.
5.9.11	Now as to why they recite a verse, they do so for the sake of well-being.
5.9.12	Now as they approach the Garhapatya and Ahavaniya fires from the east,
5.9.13	they thus make the gods satisfied and at the end they speak of the purpose.
5.9.14	Now the Pitryajña is indeed on the right side.
5.9.15	They thus make him (the sacrificer) stand in the water.
5.9.16	And when they step out towards the east and worship the sun,
5.9.17	the sun is the world of the gods,
5.9.18	the fathers are the world of the fathers.
5.9.19	They thus ascend the world of the Fathers from the world of the Gods.
5.9.20	And when he does not take the name of the sacrificer in the Sūktavāk,
5.9.21	(he does so) lest he should injure the sacrificer.
5.9.22	Now, when they do not perform the Patnîsaṃyājas,
5.9.23	(it is) lest the wives should be neglected.
5.9.24	Now, when having gone to the east, they perform the Tryambaka offerings,
5.9.25	they thereby gratify Rudra in his own direction.
5.9.26	Now, the Pitryajña is situated towards the south.
5.9.27	They thereby make it situated towards the north.
5.10.2	The year is indeed this, the thirteenth month.
5.10.3	Herein the whole year is attained.
5.10.4	And when he offers at the Suna-Sira,
5.10.5	Suna-Sira is indeed peace and healing.
5.10.6	This peace and healing is done at the end of the sacrifice.
5.10.7	If the fire is kindled, then the rite of the Visvedevas is the rite.
5.10.8	If it is not churned, then the rite of the Full Moon becomes the rite.
5.10.9	The Full Moon is indeed a rite of establishment.
5.10.10	As for the seventeen Sāmidhenī verses, the two Ajyabhāgas, the two Virājas, and the Samyājas, the Brāhmaṇa text has been explained.
5.10.11	As for nine Prayājas, nine Anuyājas, eight oblations, and the Svishtakṛt as the ninth,
5.10.12	He obtains the constellation of Viras.
5.10.13	The five offerings of the Samcara rite are similar, ending with those to Pusan and those to Visvedevas.
5.10.14	The Brāhmaṇa concerning them has been stated.
5.10.15	Then as to why one performs the Suna-Sira rite,
5.10.16	The Brāhmanical text concerning them has been spoken.
5.10.17	Then as for why one performs the Vayu rite,
5.10.18	Vayu is indeed the breath.
5.10.19	He places the breath in himself.
5.10.20	Now, the one-pot offering to Surya.
5.10.21	The one who shines is indeed Surya.
5.10.22	He pleases him.
5.10.23	Now, a white cow as Dakshina.
5.10.24	He pleases the same.
5.10.25	The form of this is made.
5.10.26	Now when they perform the expiations and substitutes, and offer oblations,
5.10.27	they are performing a rite for welfare.
5.10.28	For the peace of the sacrifice,
5.10.29	and for the healing of the sacrificer.
5.10.30	Now when they purify the sacrificer with his own fires,
5.10.31	the fires are the chariot of the gods.
5.10.32	They thus place him on the chariot of the god.
5.10.33	He goes to heaven by this divine chariot.
5.10.34	Where the world is well-done, where the world is well done.
6.1.1	Prajapati, desiring offspring, performed austerities.
6.1.2	From that heated one, five were born:
6.1.3	Agni, Vayu, Aditya, Chandra, and Usha as the fifth.
6.1.4	He said to them, "You also perform austerities."
6.1.5	They initiated themselves.
6.1.6-10	Having been initiated, having been anointed, the dawn in the form of a celestial nymph appeared before them. Their minds were attracted to her. They emitted semen. They said to their father Prajapati, "We have emitted semen. Let it become a child for us."
6.1.11	He, Prajapati, made a golden vessel, a span in height and breadth.
6.1.12	He poured it into that.
6.1.13	Then he stood up with a thousand eyes and a thousand feet.
6.1.14	With a thousand steps, he was protected.
6.1.15	He attacked his father, Prajapati.
6.1.16	He said to him, "Why did you attack me?"
6.1.17	He said, "Name me."
6.1.18	"I will not eat food without being named."
6.2.1	He said, "You are indeed."
6.2.2	"Whatever is yours, that is water."
6.2.3	Indeed, Bhava does not harm him.
6.2.4	No one harms his offspring, his cattle, or his speech.
6.2.5	But whoever hates him
6.2.6	That one becomes more sinful.
6.2.7	He who knows thus.
6.2.8	His vow is to wear wet clothes. Water does not know the limits.
6.2.9	He approached the second one.
6.2.10	He said to him, "Why do you approach me?"
6.2.11	He said, "Give me a second name."
6.2.12	"I will not eat food with only one name."
6.2.13	He said, "You are indeed!" "Only Shiva!"
6.2.14	Whatever is Agni, that is Śarva.
6.2.15	For Śarva does not harm him.
6.2.16	Nor does he harm his offspring, nor his cattle, nor his speech.
6.2.17	But he who hates him,
6.2.18	he alone becomes more sinful.
6.2.19	He who knows this,
6.2.20	his vow is that he should eat nothing at all.
6.2.21	He approached him for the third time.
6.2.22-27	He said to him, "Do not be jealous of the story." He said, "Give me a third name." He said (to him), "I will not eat food with two names." He said to him, "(You are) indeed that one." "Indeed that one" means "the lord of animals." The lord of animals is the wind. The lord of cattle does not harm him.
6.2.28	He does not injure his offspring, his cattle, or his speech.
6.2.29	But he who hates him,
6.2.30	he alone becomes the sinner.
6.2.31	He who knows this,
6.2.32	his vow is that he should not revile a brahmin.
6.2.33	He approached him for the fourth time.
6.2.34	He said to him, "Why do you approach me?"
6.2.35	He said, "Make my name the fourth."
6.2.36	"This is not to be eaten with three names."
6.2.37	He said, "You are indeed that." "The fierce one is indeed the god."
6.2.38	The fierce one is the plants and trees. By that
6.2.39	The fierce god does not harm him.
6.2.40	His offspring, his cattle, or his speech.
6.2.41	But he who hates him
6.2.42	He becomes more sinful.
6.2.43	He who knows this,
6.2.44	His vow is that he should not look at a woman.
6.3.1	He approached the fifth one.
6.3.2	He said to him, "Why do you approach me?"
6.3.3	He said, "Make my name the fifth."
6.3.4	"I will not eat food with these four names."
6.3.5	He said, "You are that." The great god said, "I am indeed the great god."
6.3.6	The great god Aditya is that.
6.3.7	The great god does not harm him.
6.3.8	No one harms his offspring, his cattle, or his speech.
6.3.9	But he who hates him
6.3.10	becomes worse.
6.3.11	He who knows this
6.3.12	He should not look at him when he is rising or setting.
6.3.13	He approached him as the sixth.
6.3.14	He said to him, "Why did you approach me?"
6.3.15	He said, "Make my name the sixth."
6.3.16	"I will not eat food with only five names."
6.3.17	He said, "You are indeed Rudra."
6.3.18	Whatever is Rudra, the Moon, by that he does not injure him.
6.3.19	Rudra does not injure him at all.
6.3.20	Nor his offspring, nor his cattle, nor his speech.
6.3.21	But he who hates him,
6.3.22	he alone becomes more sinful.
6.3.23	He who knows this,
6.3.24	his vow is that he should not eat anything uncooked, nor marrow.
6.3.25	He seized the seventh.
6.3.26	He said to him, "Do not be stingy with the story."
6.3.27	He said, "Give me the seventh name."
6.3.28	He said (to him), "I will not eat food with only six names."
6.3.29	He said to him, (the king), "You are indeed the lord."
6.3.30	Whatever is the lord, that is food.
6.3.31	Indeed, the lord does not harm him.
6.3.32	He does not injure his offspring, his cattle, or his speech.
6.3.33	But he who hates him
6.3.34	becomes the worse.
6.3.35	He who knows this
6.3.36	His vow is that he should not refuse food when requested.
6.3.37	He approaches him as the eighth.
6.3.38	He said to him, "Why do you approach me?"
6.3.39	He said, "Make my name the eighth."
6.3.40	"He does not eat food with the seven names."
6.3.41	He said, "You are indeed that." "It is indeed Indra."
6.3.42	What is Indra is indeed a thunderbolt.
6.3.43	No thunderbolt strikes him.
6.3.44	No one harms his offspring, his cattle, or his speech.
6.3.45	But he who hates him
6.3.46	becomes worse.
6.4.2	Having performed austerities, he expelled this world from the vital breath.
6.4.3	From the downward breath, the world of the atmosphere.
6.4.4	From the upward breath, the world beyond.
6.4.5	He performed austerities over these three worlds.
6.4.6	He created Agni from this world,
6.4.7	Vayu from the world of the Atmosphere, and Aditya from Heaven.
6.4.8	He performed austerity over these three luminaries.
6.4.9	He created the Rk from Agni,
6.4.10	the Yajus from Vayu, and the Sama from Aditya.
6.4.11	He then meditated on this threefold knowledge.
6.4.12	He created the sacrifice.
6.4.13	He aspired with the Rk,
6.4.14	performed with the Yajus, and sang with the Sama.
6.4.15	Then he extracted the essence of light from this threefold knowledge.
6.4.16	These are the Vedas, for the sake of healing.
6.4.17	He (Brahma) removed the earth from the Rg verses.
6.4.18	The heaven from the Yajus verses and the sky from the Saman verses.
6.4.19	He became Brahma on the right side.
6.4.20	The sacrifice stood on the right side of him, sloping towards the north.
6.4.21	The sacrifice stands on the right side, sloping towards the south.
6.5.1	He who knows this becomes Brahman.
6.5.2	They say, "One becomes a Hotṛ by means of the Ṛgveda, an Adhvaryu by means of the Yajurveda, an Udgātṛ by means of Sāman, but by what does one become a Brahman?"
6.5.3	He who has driven away the essence of brilliance of the three Vedas.
6.5.4	By that one becomes a Brahman.
6.5.5	They say, "Which Veda and which branch of the Veda do you want?"
6.5.6	Some say, "The Adhvaryu."
6.5.7	He becomes the expert in the rites.
6.5.8	Some say, “The Chandogas.”
6.5.9	Thus his sacrifices are performed by the three Vedas.
6.5.10	But it is settled that the Bahvṛcas are the ones.
6.5.11	These two Vedas are the ones that are to be followed.
6.5.12-19	Herein, the Hotr is the most important. Grahas are taken with Rk verses. Sāman chants are sung in Rk verses. Therefore, one should be a Bahvṛca (one who knows many Rk verses). They say, "How much does the Brahman priest contribute to the sanctification of the sacrifice and how much do the other priests?" One should say, "Half." There are two ways of performing a sacrifice: One is sanctified by speech;
6.5.20	The mind is different.
6.5.21	That which is performed by speech,
6.5.22	other priests perform it.
6.5.23	And that which is performed by the mind, the Brahman priest performs it.
6.5.24	Therefore, as much as can be done by the Veda, the Yajur Veda, and the Sama Veda,
6.5.25	the Brahman priest should remain silent.
6.5.26	Because half of the sacrifice is performed by him.
6.5.27	Then, when they would tell him,
6.5.28	"Brahman, we shall perform, Brahman, we shall offer, Brahman, we will go forth, Brahman, we praise."
6.5.29	One should recite this much: "Om."
6.5.30	This is the one syllable that represents the three Vedas.
6.6.1	Thus one's knowledge of the three Vedas becomes accomplished.
6.6.2	The sacrifice is established in Brahman.
6.6.3	Whatever is the slip or excess in the sacrifice,
6.6.4	they say it is of Brahman.
6.6.5	He heals it with the threefold knowledge.
6.6.6	If there is an excess in the Rk,
6.6.7	having taken four spoonfuls of ghee, one should offer a propitiatory oblation on the Garhapatya fire with the formula, "Bhūr svāhā."
6.6.8	He places that verse in the verse.
6.6.9	He performs the expiation for the verse.
6.6.10	Now if there is an excess in the Yajurveda,
6.6.11	Having taken four spoonfuls of ghee, one should offer an expiatory oblation in the Anvāhāryapachana, the oblation for the Haviryajña in the Agnidhra, and the Soma in the Adhvara, with the formula "Bhuvah svāhā."
6.6.12	He places that Yajurveda in the Yajurvedas.
6.6.13	He performs the expiation with a Yajus for a Yajus.
6.6.14	If there is an excess in the Saman,
6.6.15	one should take four spoonfuls of clarified butter and offer an expiatory oblation on the Ahavaniya fire with the formula, "Svāhā to Svāhā."
6.6.16	He thus establishes the Saman in the Saman.
6.6.17	He performs the expiation for the Saman with the Saman. 
6.6.18	If there is excess in the unknown (part),
6.6.19	Having taken four spoonfuls of clarified butter, one should offer the expiatory oblation on the Āhavanīya fire with the words, "Bhūr Bhuvah Svah Svāhā."
6.7.1	Indeed, he who performs the expiation with these Vyāhṛtis restores the prosperity of the sacrifice.
6.7.2	One who knows these Vyāhṛti verses should not say, "I do not know this," when approached.
6.7.3	He who knows these Vyāhrtis, knows everything.
6.7.4	Just as a person with phlegm and mucus is cured by the application of a salve,
6.7.5	in the same way, these Vyāhrti-s are curative for the entire Trividya (the three Vedas).
6.7.6	When one removes grass from the seat of Brahman,
6.7.7	one purifies it.
6.7.8	Then he sits down, saying, "I sit down in the seat of Arvāvasu."
6.7.9	Arvāvasu indeed was the Brahman of the gods.
6.7.10	He thus settles him first, saying, "May the sacrifice be performed without injury."
6.7.11	Then, having sat down, he mutters, "Brihaspati is the Brahman."
6.7.12	Brihaspati indeed was the Brahman among the gods.
6.8.1	In this very (sacrifice) he desires to obtain permission.
6.8.2	He restrains his speech when the offerings are being prepared or are being prepared, until the scraping of the oblations.
6.8.3	This indeed is the gate of the sacrifice.
6.8.4	He thus makes it non-empty.
6.8.5	And because of the offering and the Svishtakrit and the Anuyajas,
6.8.6	This indeed is a second gate of the sacrifice.
6.8.7	He thus makes it not empty.
6.8.8	Now, when the gods were performing the sacrifice,
6.8.9	they offered the Prastara to Savitr.
6.8.10	He cut off his hands.
6.8.11	They gave him two golden hands.
6.8.12	Therefore he is praised as having golden hands.
6.8.13	They offered it to Bhaga.
6.8.14	He gouged out his eyes.
6.8.15	Therefore they say, "The blind one is Bhaga."
6.8.16	They gave it to Pūṣan.
6.8.17	He put his teeth on it.
6.8.18	Therefore they say, "Pūṣan is toothless, the eater of porridge."
6.8.19	Those gods said:
6.9.1	"Indra is the strongest and most powerful among the gods, therefore he takes it away."
6.9.2	They gave that to him.
6.9.3	Then he pacifies it with Brahma.
6.9.4	Therefore Indra says, "Brahma."
6.9.5	He waits for it, saying, "I wait for you with the eye of Mitra."
6.9.6	He pacifies it with the eye of Indra.
6.9.7	Then he receives it, saying, “I receive you in the impulse of the divine Savitr, with the arms of the Ashvins, with the hands of Pusan.”
6.9.8	With these very deities he appeases it.
6.9.9	Having arranged the grass, he places the staff on the mound, saying, "I place you in the navel of the earth, on the lap of Aditi."
6.9.10	Earth is the appeaser of foods.
6.9.11	He appeases it.
6.9.12	Then he takes it and eats, saying, "I eat with Agni's mouth."
6.9.13	Agni is the pacifier of foods.
6.9.14	He pacifies it with that.
6.9.15	Then he sips water, saying, "You are peace."
6.9.16	Water is indeed the remedy for peace.
6.9.17	This is the remedy for peace that is performed at the sacrifice.
6.9.18	Then he touches the vital airs,
6.9.19	Whatever is done to the breath here, whatever is destroyed, that he nourishes and heals.
6.9.20	He touches the navel last, saying, "I place you in Indra's belly."
6.9.21	For Indra indeed pacified him.
6.9.22	And when he proceeds with the Savitri recitation,
6.9.23	Savitrī is the bestower of offspring. For the sake of offspring of the rite.
6.9.24	Prajapati created the sacrifice.
6.9.25	He created semen by means of Agnihotra.
6.9.26	By means of Agnihotra, he created gods, men and demons.
6.9.27	By meansof the New and Full Moon sacrifices, he created Indra.
6.9.28	He created this food and drink for them.
6.9.29	These are the oblations and sacrifices, the Soma sacrifice.
6.9.30	Then, whatever desire they wished for, they obtained it through these means.
6.9.31	Through the Āgrayaṇa rite, they obtained food.
6.9.32	They say, "Why are they called means?"
6.9.33	They are indeed means of going to heaven and to all desires.
6.10.1	Through the Cāturmāsya rites, they obtained all heavenly worlds, all desires, all eightfold prosperity, and immortality.
6.10.2	This Prajapati, the twenty-fourfold year, is the four months.
6.10.3	His mouth is indeed the Visvedevata.
6.10.4	The new and full moon sacrifices are the joints.
6.10.5	The days and nights are the bones and marrow.
6.10.6	The arms are the Varunapraghasa.
6.10.7	The three Iṣṭis are the breath, the out-breath, and the through-breath.
6.10.8	The self is the great oblation.
6.10.9	Those who are the inner deities, they are the other Iṣṭis.
6.10.10	Prajapati is the entire year of twenty-four months.
6.10.11	The four months are the entire year.
6.10.12	He who knows this, he who knows this, obtains everything by everything.
7.1.1	Speech is consecration.
7.1.2	For one is consecrated by speech.
7.1.3	The consecrated one is the breath.
7.1.4	The gods, by means of the initiation, by means of their breath, having taken all desires on both sides, placed them in themselves.
7.1.5	In the same way, the sacrificer, by means of initiation, by means to his breath, having taken on both sides all desires, places them in himself.
7.1.6	He offers a cake on eleven potsherds to Agni-Visnu.
7.1.7	Agni is the most honoured of the gods, Vishnu the most honoured of all.
7.1.8	He who is the most honoured among the gods and he who is the most honored of all,
7.1.9	by these two he embraces all the gods and attains to their world.
7.1.10	Therefore one who has been initiated may go to the forest at will.
7.1.11	For his gods are embraced by him.
7.1.12	He consecrates with the consecrations of the vital airs, which are without a body.
7.2.1	The vital airs are the Prajās, the Apanās are the Anu-yājas.
7.2.2	When they perform with the Prajā and Anu-yāja offerings,
7.2.3	they consecrate the vital airs and the Apanā.
7.2.4	What is offered is the body.
7.2.5	He obtains all desires by being consecrated with the body.
7.2.6	Those who are initiated with the Prāṇāpānas attain the same world and union with all the deities.
7.2.7	One should recite fifteen Sāmidhenī verses.
7.2.8	The Sāmidhenīs are indeed the thunderbolt.
7.2.9	The thunderbolt is fifteenfold.
7.2.10	The Ajyabhāga offerings are for the slaying of Vṛtra.
7.2.11	The Ajya offerings are for the killing of Vṛtra.
7.2.12	The Tristubh verses are the Yajya and Puronuvakya of the oblation.
7.2.13	The thunderbolt is the Tristubh.
7.2.14	By means of this threefold prosperous thunderbolt, the gods drove away the Asuras from these worlds.
7.2.15	In the same way, the sacrificer drives away his hateful enemies from these worlds by means of this threefold prospering thunderbolt.
7.2.16	The two Ajya-parts are for Indra and Agni, the thunderbolt-slayer. They have been mentioned.
7.2.17	Now, the Yajya and Puronuvakya of the oblation.
7.2.18	"The verse, "Your tongues have brought down the ghee," is Avatī.
7.2.19	This is the form of Puronuvakyas.
7.2.20	" "The verse, ". . . . . . your tongues have brought down ghee," is Udvati.
7.2.21	This is in the form of Yajya.
7.2.22	The two verses are in Tristubh metre."
7.2.23	Strength, valour, is the Tristubh.
7.2.24	He thus bestows strength and valour on the sacrificer.
7.3.1	"One should say, "The Aguru-verse," at the Ida and the Suktavaka."
7.3.2	When the cake to Agni-Vishnu is offered,
7.3.3	then one becomes consecrated. So it is said.
7.3.4	Therefore one should say, "Aguru-verse."
7.3.5	Just as the name of the sacrificer is not taken in the Sūktavāka when one is consecrated,
7.3.6	because the consecrated one is the embryo of the gods.
7.3.7	They do not give a name to an unborn embryo.
7.3.8	Therefore his name is not taken.
7.3.9	He does not recite the Veda to his wife, nor does he spread it out like this.
7.3.10	The sacrifice is as if not established here, where the Soma sacrifice is.
7.3.11	"Let us not wait for the auspicious time to establish the sacrifice."
7.3.12	They say, "Why do they not eat the food of one who is consecrated?"
7.3.13	When one consecrates oneself, one becomes an offering.
7.3.14	Just as one would eat the food of an offering that has not been offered, so it is.
7.3.15	One may eat if one desires.
7.3.16	Just as if one were to eat the food of a worn-out offering, so it is.
7.3.17	They say, why do others not take the name of one who is consecrated?
7.3.18	One who is being consecrated approaches Agni, approaches himself.
7.3.19	That is why others do not take his name.
7.3.20	"So that he does not approach Agni."
7.3.21	That is why he does not take the name (of another).
7.3.22	"So that one who is Agni does not burn him."
7.3.23	He should consume the name of the one he hates.
7.3.24	Having been consecrated, he should consume the name.
7.3.25	He burns him down as if he were Agni.
7.3.26	Now if one wishes
7.4.1	He should take the name of the person with the speech of the one who sees well.
7.4.2	That is the atonement there.
7.4.3	The eye is the one who sees.
7.4.4	For one sees with the eye.
7.4.5	There is only one utterance, the speech of the consecrated. It is indeed true.
7.4.6	He who speaks the truth.
7.4.7	He is called a Diksita.
7.4.8	They say, why does the Diksita not offer Agnihotra?
7.4.9	The Asuras offered in the self, in the wind, without fire.
7.4.10	They were defeated, offering without fire.
7.4.11	Then the gods placed this very breath as Agni in between.
7.4.12	Now, the vow is given in the evening and morning.
7.4.13	This is his Agnihotra, which he offers continuously, without interruption, in this life-breath Agni.
7.4.14	This is the continuity of Agnihotra in the consecration rites.
7.4.15	They perform the Proṣṭhapada rites.
7.4.16	What is the deliberation on the Sutyā?
7.5.1	Now, then, the consecration of Keśin.
7.5.2	Keśin, son of Dārbhya, sat down while consecrated.
7.5.3	Then the golden bird said to him:
7.5.4	"You are not initiated. I know the initiation. I will tell you.
7.5.5	I have sacrificed once. I am afraid of its destruction.
7.5.6	You know the land of one who has sacrificed once. Tell me that."
7.5.7	He said, "So be it."
7.5.8	They both spoke together:
7.5.9	He was there.
7.5.10	Ula or Varshnivrddha, or Itan or Kavya, or Shikhandin or Yajnasena,
7.5.11	or whoever he was, he was.
7.5.12	He said:
7.5.13	"These bodies are indeed consecrated for the sacrifice.
7.5.14	The deities in a man,
7.5.15	for whom these are consecrated,
7.5.16	he is consecrated." So he said.
7.6.1	When the Adhvaryu offers the Audgrabhanas,
7.6.2	The sacrificer should offer five oblations.
7.6.3	"The first one is, "May my mind be consecrated with mind, svāhā."
7.6.4	"The second one is, "My speech be consecrated with speech, svāhā."]
7.6.5	"The third one is, "The breath of life be consecrated with breath of life, svāhā."
7.6.6	He mentions the breath of life in the middle."
7.6.7	Because this breath of life is in the middle.
7.6.8	"May my eye be consecrated with the eye, svāhā." The fourth.
7.6.9	"May my ear be consecrated with the ear, svāhā," the fifth.
7.6.10	Now indeed Kauṣītaki said this:
7.6.11	"One should not offer.
7.6.12	The oblations would be excessive if they were to be offered.
7.6.13	One should recite the mantras in accordance with the offerings made by the Adhvaryu.
7.6.14	"May my mind be consecrated with the mind." This is the first one.
7.6.15	"May my speech be consecrated with speech." This is the second one.
7.6.16	" May my breath be consecrated with breath." This is the third one.
7.6.17	He says the breath in the middle.
7.6.18	Because this breath is in the middle. 
7.6.19	"May my sight be consecrated with sight." This is the fourth one.
7.6.20	" "May my hearing be consecrated with hearing." This is the fifth one.
7.6.21	The deities in the man are indeed initiated.
7.6.22	The oblations are not offered in excess."
7.6.23	Now indeed, faith alone is the foundation of a single sacrifice.
7.6.24	He who sacrifices with faith,
7.6.25	his sacrifice does not perish.
7.6.26	Water is the foundation.
7.6.27	Those that are in these worlds and those that are within.
7.6.28	He who, knowing this, performs the sacrifice,
7.6.29	his sacrifice is not exhausted.
7.6.30	This indeed was told by Keshi Darbhya to the golden bird, of the sacrifice performed once.
7.6.31	One should consecrate oneself in the afternoon.
7.6.32	In the afternoon, indeed, he encompasses all beings.
7.6.33	Even the darkness passes over him.
7.6.34	Therefore, he is called 'red' or 'reddish'.
7.6.35	One who is being initiated identifies himself with this (sun).
7.6.36	If one is initiated in the afternoon,
7.6.37	it is for the attainment of all desires.
7.7.1	The gods attained the vital breath through the Prāyaniya (rite) and the Udayaniya (rite) the upward-moving breath.
7.7.2	In the same way, the sacrificer obtains the vital breath through the Pravargya and the Udaygya.
7.7.3	The Pravargya and Udaygya are indeed the vital breath and the out-breath.
7.7.4	Therefore, the priests of the Pravargya should be the same as those of the Udaygya,
7.7.5	because the vital breath and out-breath are the same.
7.7.6	The gods, going to the heavenly world by the Pravargya rite, did not know the directions.
7.7.7	Then Agni said to them:
7.7.8	"If you offer a single oblation of ghee to me, I will know one direction."
7.7.9	Therefore they offered.
7.7.10	He knew the eastern direction.
7.7.11	Therefore they lead Agni eastward.
7.7.12	The sacrifice is performed before him.
7.7.13	They offer oblations to him while he is seated facing the east.
7.7.14	This is his well-known direction.
7.7.15	Then Soma said:
7.7.16	"Let me be offered a single oblation of ghee, and I will know one direction."
7.7.17	Therefore they offered it.
7.7.18	He knew the southern direction.
7.7.19	Therefore they carry the Soma bought with Dakṣiṇā.
7.7.20	Standing with Dakṣiṇa, he praises.
7.7.21	Standing with the Dakṣiṇās, he places (the Soma).
7.7.22	They sprinkle him while he is seated with the Dakṣinās.
7.7.23	This is indeed his well-known direction.
7.7.24	Then Savitar said,
7.7.25	"Let me know one direction by offering a single oblation of ghee to me."
7.7.26	Therefore, they offered.
7.7.27	He knew the western direction.
7.7.28	That is indeed Savitar, the one who shines.
7.7.29	Therefore, they see him moving towards the west every day, not towards the east.
7.7.30	For this is the direction known to him.
7.7.31	Then Pathya Svashti said, "
7.7.32	'If you offer a single oblation of ghee to me, I will know one direction.'
7.7.33	They offered it to her.
7.7.34	She knew the northern direction.
7.7.35	Pathya Svashti is speech.
7.7.36	Therefore, speech is more known in the northern direction. It is raised.
7.7.37	They go north to learn speech.
7.7.38	Or he who comes from there.
7.7.39	Or they listen to him. Thus it is said.
7.7.40	This is the known direction of speech.
7.8.1	Then Aditi said:
7.8.2	"Let me offer a single oblation of food. I will know one direction."
7.8.3	They offered to her.
7.8.4	She knew the upward direction.
7.8.5	This indeed is Aditi.
7.8.6	Therefore, above this are the plants, above are the trees, above are the men, they rise up.
7.8.7	The fire burns upwards.
7.8.8	Whatever is above this, all that is dependent on it.
7.8.9	This is the direction of that (fire).
7.8.10	Thus the gods knew heaven through the Pravargya.
7.8.11	In the same way, the sacrificer, by means of the Pravargya rite, knows heaven.
7.8.12	They should be equal, the Pravargya and the Udayaniya.
7.8.13	The sacrifice is indeed a chariot of the gods.
7.8.14	Its wings are the Pravargya, and the Udayaniya.
7.8.15	He who makes them equal,
7.8.16-20	Just as a chariot, with its two sides, and with a fierce driver, would not reach the destination while running on the path. Thus he does not attain the auspicious world of heaven. Now he who makes it uneven. Just as a chariot, on one side, with its fierce driver, would reach the destination while racing on the path. Thus he does not attain a good world of heaven.
7.8.21	Therefore the Prayaṇīya and Udayaniya should be equal.
7.9.1	The Prayaṇīyā is concluded with a Śamyu, the Udayaniya is concluded with a Samyu.
7.9.2	He offers the first Svāstīvāraṇa to Pathyā.
7.9.3	Then Agni, then Soma, then Savitā, then Aditi.
7.9.4	One goes to heaven by the Prayaṇiya.
7.9.5	That he offers the first Svāstivāraṇa to Pathyä,
7.9.6	It is indeed a rite for the attainment of welfare, for the attainment of the world of heaven.
7.9.7	He offers Agni first on the Udayaniya (rite).
7.9.8	Then Soma, then Savitar, then Pathya Svashti, then Aditi.
7.9.9	He attains this world by the Udayaniya rite.
7.9.10	And why he offers Pathya Svashthi afterwards,
7.9.11	It is indeed a rite of attainment of welfare, and for the attainment of this world.
7.9.12	Those are the five deities to whom he offers.
7.9.13	By them he obtains all that is fivefold, pertaining to the gods and the self.
7.9.14	These are the Yajya and Puronuvakya verses of those deities.
7.9.15	They are the verses of prosperity, of the path, of crossing, of progress, and of leading.
7.9.16	The Maruts, the divine assembly, are the lords of the atmosphere, and they are the ones who lead the sacrificer to the heavenly world.
7.9.17	Therefore, they are called 'those who lead to heaven'.
7.9.18	The Maruts, the assembly of gods, do not harm him.
7.9.19	He attains the heavenly world with prosperity.
7.10.1	They are reversed.
7.10.2	The Puronuvākyās of the Pravargya are the Yājyās of the Udayanīya.
7.10.3	The Yājyās are the Puronuvākyat.
7.10.4	One who proceeds with the Pravargya rite moves away from this world.
7.10.5	When he reverses,
7.10.6	he stands firm in this world.
7.10.7	In firmness, in non-falling.
7.10.8	Now the Chhandas are indeed the Pranas.
7.10.9	He thus places the Pranas in himself for non-injury.
7.10.10	For these Pranas are indeed the ones that are not exhausted, not exhausted.
7.10.11	"The most excellent of your praises, O Agni, is the Anushtubh." The two Anushtubh verses are at the Samyajya.
7.10.12	The Tati is indeed the Pravargya of the sacrifice.
7.10.13	Speech is the Anushtup.
7.10.14	The sacrifice is supported by speech.
7.10.15	These (verses) do not go astray.
7.10.16	At the Pratiṣṭha sacrifice.
7.10.17	"So that they do not go astray at the Pratiṣtha."
7.11.1	It ends with the Sāmya.
7.11.2	That is its form.
7.11.3	Just as one who goes forward would dwell in the heaven world, so it is.
7.11.4	In that it ends with the Sāmī.
7.11.5	All the deities come together at the Prāyaṇīya.
7.11.6	He who would offer here,
7.11.7	he should offer to the wives of the gods in accordance with the proper order.
7.11.8	If someone were to say there,
7.11.9	"He has offered to the wives of gods in the proper order,"
7.11.10	"His wife will be in the assembly," it would be so.
7.11.11	Therefore it is peaceful.
7.11.12	For the gods, for the unequalled.
7.11.13	The Asuras fought with the gods in this direction, which is east and north.
7.11.14	They, being in this direction, consecrated Soma as king.
7.11.15	With Soma as king, they drove the Asuras away from these worlds.
7.11.16	In the same way, the sacrificer, with Soma, the king, drives away his enemies, his rivals, from these worlds.
7.12.1	He buys it with four things: a cow, the moon, a garment, and a goat.
7.12.2	The four is a pair, a couple, procreation, for propagation.
7.12.3	That is the king Soma, the moon.
7.12.4	He enters this bought (Soma).
7.12.5	When he buys Soma, the king,
7.12.6	Soma, the king, is indeed the discerning moon. He is the one who is poured out.
7.12.7	To the bought one he yokes the new (horses).
7.12.8	These are the new vital airs.
7.12.9	He thus places the vital airs in the sacrificer.
7.12.10	For all-existence in this world,
7.12.11	for immortality in the other.
7.12.12	"May it lead to the good from the good." He recites the Pravartani verses.
7.12.13	"May Brhaspati be your leader."
7.12.14	Brhaspati is indeed Brahman.
7.12.15	For the attainment of Brahman-fame.
7.12.16	"While he was learning this thought, the god spread out the sky in the forests." He recites two Tristubh verses addressed to Varuna.
7.12.17	The Tristubh is indeed the nobility.
7.12.18	Varuna is the Kshatra.
7.12.19	For the protection of the fame of the Kshatra,
7.12.20	One should recite four Gāyatrī verses beginning with "O Soma, those of yours that are bountiful" in the Soma-related manner.
7.12.21	Brahma is indeed the Gāyatrī.
7.12.22	Soma is the Kshattra.
7.12.23	For the sake of protecting the fame of Brahma and the fame of the kshatra,
7.12.24	Having recited half of the last one, one should stop.
7.12.25	The Rk is indeed immortality.
7.12.26	That nectar enters.
7.12.27	Then indeed the Brahman is the Rik.
7.12.28	He makes the armor of that Brahman and the half-verse both ways.
7.12.29	Wherever one may cease with the half-verse,
7.12.30	That is indeed the Brahman.
7.12.31	"He recites the verse, 'Those who worship you with oblations,' when the Pravati is being led forward."
7.12.32	The Goddess has come with the seasons, may she grow and not decay. She comes with the seasons.
7.12.33	"Kauṣītaki said, "Soma is indeed the king of the year."
7.12.34	He comes with the seasons, he comes with them.
7.12.35	He recites the verses in a pleasing manner.
7.12.36	What is pleasing at a sacrifice is prosperous. For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
7.12.37	He recits nine verses.
7.12.38	The Brāhmaṇa concerning them has been recited.
7.12.39	Three times with the first (verse), three times with the last, thus thirteen are completed.
7.12.40	Twelve months are a year.
7.12.41	For the attainment of the year.
7.12.42	There is a thirteenth month.
7.12.43	It is known as the Upacara. For the attainment of that, for the attainment of that.
8.1.1	The gods, indeed, obtained the two-footed and four-footed animals through hospitality.
8.1.2	In the same way, the sacrificer, by means of hospitality, obtains the animals with two feet and four feet.
8.1.3	They churn the fire near the oblation for hospitality.
8.1.4	Hospitality is the head of this sacrifice.
8.1.5	The fire is the breath.
8.1.6	He places the breath in the head.
8.1.7	One should recite twelve verses while churning the fire.
8.1.8	The year consists of twelve months.
8.1.9	For the attainment of the year.
8.1.10	He recites the Savitri verse beginning with "O god Savitar, do thou approach us."
8.1.11	For being impelled by Savitar.
8.1.12	For one who is impelled by Savitar, there is no misfortune. For the absence of misfortune.
8.1.13	He recitess the Dyava-Pritbvi verse beginning with "The great heaven and earth."
8.1.14	The heaven and earth are indeed the foundation; (it is) for the foundation.
8.1.15	"They churned thee, O Agni, from the Puṣkara, (saying): "The Trivṛt is being churned."
8.1.16	"Let the creatures speak: "He who is born."
8.1.17	"He who is held in the hand, not to be eaten."
8.1.18	"The god who is led to the divine assembly."
8.1.19	"Born, born, O Agni, the knower," (he says) to the one being called forth.
8.1.20	"Agni is kindled by Agni," (he says), to the one being kindled, to the one being offered.
8.1.21	"They anoint him, the well-intentioned," (he says,) to the one being placed in his own places. "The strong one," (he says to) the one having an end.
8.1.22	The end is the place of decay.
8.1.23	The end belongs to the one being put in place.
8.1.24	He places the end in the end.
8.2.1	This is indeed the same as the Catu-māśya rites.
8.2.2	Three times with the first verse, three times with the last verse, thus sixteen verses are completed.
8.2.3	This entire universe consists of sixteen parts.
8.2.4	For the attainment of this entire universe.
8.2.5	Now when an animal is to be sacrificed,
8.2.6	then having recited this verse in the reverse order, he concludes with the Tristubh verse, "The gods worshipped the sacrifice with sacrifice."
8.2.7	The animals are of the Tristubh metre; for the attainment of animals.
8.2.8	Three times with the first (verse), three times with the last (verse), they amount to seventeen.
8.2.9	Prajapati is seventeenfold.
8.2.10	This is the work of the one who succeeds, namely, that which is in accordance with Prajapati.
8.2.11	One should recite seventeen Sāmidhenī verses.
8.2.12	Prajapti is seventeenfold.
8.2.13	This is the most worthy rite, which is equal to Prajapati.
8.2.14	The two oblations of Vartraghna are for the destruction of sin.
8.2.15	And then his sacrifice becomes complete from the Soma-sacrifice.
8.2.16	Some perform the Atithimanta rites.
8.2.17	But they should be performed as Vartraghnas.
8.2.18	Some say that the two oblations should be offered with the Rg-verse.
8.2.19	Those who say that the Rg and Yajus are the deities at the Upasads.
8.2.20	But they are indeed established as the sacrificer and the sacrificer.
8.2.21	He offers to Soma, to Vishnu.
8.2.22	That is what he does when he enters this (Soma) as if it were bought.
8.2.23	That is indeed his Vaisnava form.
8.2.24	When he offers to Soma, the bought, to Vishnu,
8.2.25	Here only, by this name, is Vishnu.
8.2.26	The first one is called Soma by this.
8.2.27	Therefore, those who say 'Soma' offer oblations and consume in this way.
8.2.28	The Yajya and Puronuvakya verses are in Tristubh meter.
8.2.29	Tristubh is strength and energy.
8.2.30	He thus places strength and energy in the sacrificer.
8.3.1	The Hotr, the brilliant charioteer of the sacrifice, whose own horses are well-golden, O Agni, (thus) at the Samyajya, the Atithi and Rathvati, in Tristubh, Agniya.
8.3.2	As it is fourfold prosperity, so it is.
8.3.3	The chariot becomes like a companion to him who performs these.
8.3.4	It ends with the word "Idam."
8.3.5	It is the form for advancing.
8.3.6	It is as if one were to go up and dwell in the world of heaven.
8.3.7	These are the rites of Upāṁshu-Havis: the Diksaniyā, Prayāṇīyā, Atithi, and Upasad.
8.3.8	These rites are the impregnation of semen.
8.3.9	Semen is indeed impregnated silently.
8.3.10	They proceed to abandon their duties.
8.3.11	The Diksaniyā ends with the Patnīsaṁyājas.
8.3.12	The Pravargya rite ends with the Samyu rite.
8.3.13	The Atithya rite ends with the Idā rite.
8.3.14	One offers to the deities at the Upavasatha rite.
8.3.15	Prajapati went to heaven by means of these rites.
8.3.16	In the same way the sacrificer goes to heaven by means means of these rites
8.4.1	The Mahāvrata is the head of the sacrifice.
8.4.2	Therefore one should not perform it at the first sacrifice.
8.4.3	The later sacrifice of one who does not perform it at a first sacrifice becomes superior.
8.4.4	But if one is a learned person who is not greedy, one should perform it.
8.4.5	The self is indeed that sacrifice.
8.4.6	He makes that sacrifice complete by means of the self.
8.4.7	That is indeed the great hero, he who shines.
8.4.8-14	He pleases him with this. One should praise him with one hundred (verses). He shines at a distance of a hundred yojanas. With a hundred (verses) he attains a distance of a thousand yojanas. And the one who is the hundred and first, that is the world of the sacrificer. The sacrificer attains this self. They know the person in the sun.
8.4.15	He is Indra, he is Prajapati, that is Brahman.
8.4.16	Herein the sacrificer attains the same world, the same union with all the deities.
8.5.1	One should praise without interruption for the continuity of the vital airs.
8.5.2	For the vital airs are indeed continuous.
8.5.3	One should recite loudly and clearly.
8.5.4	The vital airs are the praises.
8.5.5	For this is indeed clear.
8.5.6	This is indeed the deity of speech.
8.5.7	The Savitri verses are the first to be recited.
8.5.8	For the purpose of being blessed by Savitri.
8.5.9	For one who is blessed by Savitri, there is no misfortune, for the purpose of being free from misfortune.
8.5.10	"Brahma, the unborn, the first, in front."
8.5.11	Indeed, Brahma, the unborn, is the first in front.
8.5.12	Where he shines.
8.5.13	He thus makes the sacrificer the same as that (Agni).
8.5.14	The priests, while anointing him, say, "Do thou be firm; thou art great." He praises the two, the one who is anointed and the one who is not anointed, in a similar manner.
8.5.15	O Agni, may your good minds be directed towards us. O Agni, among the enemies, you are the one who is most austere. O Agni, he who harms us with his generosity, you are the three most austere and beautiful ones, he praises them.
8.5.16	Whatever is beautiful at the sacrifice, that is prosperous. For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
8.5.17	"Thou, O Agni, art the slayer of fiends; thou hast slain the fiends, the Rākṣasas. Thou hast destroyed the fiends, O Agni, thou hast driven them away."
8.5.18	Agni indeed is the slayer of fiendish beings.
8.5.19	They are five in number, in the form of the directions.
8.5.20	He thus drives them away from the directions.
8.5.21	And also those which the Adhvaryu measures out as the quarters, he thus describes them with these (verses).
8.5.22	The verse "Thy praise, O lover of praise, I have placed on both thy sides; the praiseworthy speech" is sung with the two verses of the Indra-Vatsa kind.
8.5.23	He repeats the Svāhā-form of Indra with these two verses.
8.6.1	And he repeats the chips which the Adhvaryu has cut out with the former one.
8.6.2	He places the last one with the latter one.
8.6.3	The one who has the golden arrow, the one who has the silver arrow, the one with the golden arrow, and the one with the silver arrow, he praises the Pūṣan and Rudra in a suitable manner.
8.6.4	He recites the Svāhā-form with both Pūṣan's and Rudra's.
8.6.5	And also the two golden and silver pieces that the Adhvaryu makes, he recites with these.
8.6.6	The flying insect, smeared with the demon's magic.
8.6.7	The flying insect is the breath.
8.6.8	The breath is the wind.
8.6.9	He recites these verses with the wind-offering Svāhā.
8.6.10	"I saw you with my mind, O Chekitāna," one should recite this for one who desires offspring in his abode.
8.6.11	And both are for one who has not accomplished.
8.6.12	All (the verses) beginning with "The drops of the flowing (Soma) have united in the sieve, the strainer."
8.6.13	Two (verses) beginning with "Thy strainer is spread out, O Brahmanaspati."
8.6.14	One (verse) beginning with "When the strainer was spread out by the mind."
8.6.15	These are the twelve Pavamana verses.
8.6.16	He recites them with the Svāhā-form of Soma.
8.6.17	"This Vena was urged by Prsnigarbha."
8.6.18	Vena was Indra.
8.6.19	He recites the Svāhā-form of the Indra-verse with these (verses).
8.6.20	He releases one of them, saying, "To the sky, to the bird falling down."
8.6.21	This is his own reflection.
8.6.22	He places it in the northern (direction).
8.6.23	It becomes separated from him.
8.6.24	One should recite the Pāvamānī verses for one who has been condemned on both sides.
8.6.25	The self is indeed Vena.
8.7.6-12	He should meditate on the hero for Vīrakāmā. One does obtain a hero. "The nine verses beginning with "Ka Rādhadhotrā, O Asvins," are Akūdhricya." The Akūdhriccya verses are like the Gāyatrī metre. The breath is indeed Gāyatrī. The Akūdhrīcya verses are indeed the breath. "The three verses beginning with ". . . . . . . . . . . with all your blessings" are Anushtubh. That is speech.
8.7.13	"May Vishnu create the womb" - this is to be recited by one desiring offspring in his own house.
8.7.14	And both are for the accomplishment of the two.
8.7.15	"May the morning-eaters offer the first oblation" - this is the morning hymn.
8.7.16	"The Agni shines forth, the front of the dawns" - this is recited in the afternoon.
8.7.17	The Triṣṭubh has five verses and is the eye.
8.7.18	I praise the heaven and earth, the first-born, the two, the gods, the two, Dyaus and Prithivi. This is the Gāyatrī verse of twenty-five syllables. It is the ear.
8.7.19	This is the head.
8.7.20	The head is indeed prosperous, in which there is breath, speech, sight, and hearing.
8.7.21	He places them in it.
8.7.22	When it is said, "The heat is pleasing," the dawn becomes pleasing. He praises the one who is pleasing and beautiful with the verse, "Prsni is the foremost."
8.7.23	Whatever is beautiful at the sacrifice is prosperous. For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
8.7.24	They are one hundred and one in number. The Brahmanical explanation of them has been stated.
8.8.1	The thirty-three are the northern ones.
8.8.2	The thirty three are all the deities.
8.8.3	They alone are worthy of being raised up.
8.8.4	It is from them that it is raised up.
8.8.5	The two (cows) are to be milked for the (Soma) juice. One praises them.
8.8.6	What is suitable at a sacrifice, that is prosperous. For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
8.8.7	"One praises them with the two verses, "Pour the juice, pour the prosperity, the sage of the Asvins."
8.8.8	"The god Savitar, rising, praises the rising sun, in the form of the rising sun."
8.8.9	"Brahmanaspati has gone forth," he says to those who have gone forth; he praises the Brahmanaspati form of the going forth.
8.8.10	"The bird in the sky, falling down," he says to the moving ones; he praises the form of the falling down.
8.8.11	One should offer with two (verses).
8.8.12	The two are the strength; for the sake of having strength.
8.8.13	With verses in the Tristubh metre in the forenoon.
8.8.14	This (verse) is in the Tristubha metre.
8.8.15	Having conquered the three worlds, he stands.
8.8.16	With verses having the Jagati metre in the afternoon.
8.8.17	This (metre) is in the Jagati metre.
8.8.18	When he enters, everything follows him.
8.8.19	Some say that one should offer the Vasat-call with the Dasat-call.
8.8.20	But it is indeed as stated.
8.8.21	Then he praises with the following verses.
8.8.22	Whatever is auspicious at a sacrifice, that is prosperous. For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
8.8.23	"The divine abode of the offering and the offered is great."
8.8.24	He thus makes the oblation fresh again.
8.8.25	He places it with the benediction, "May the goddess be prosperous."
8.8.26	He thus pronounces a blessing on the animals.
8.8.27	Thus the animals do not leave the sacrificer.
8.8.28	Now they say that the Pravargya is at the Sūta (rite), at the Bahispavamāna.
8.8.29	Then the Ashvins, the gods, call out.
8.8.30	At this time, they should perform the Pravargya rite at the Agnidhra chamber.
8.8.31	Just as it is done during the Upavasatha rite,
8.8.32	so it is done here during the Stutiya rite.
8.8.33	The approach is without any deviation.
8.8.34	When the rite is completed,
8.8.35	then the animal sacrifice is performed.
8.8.36	This is the great hero, the midday offering.
8.8.37	Now, when he moves about at midday with this (fire),
8.8.38	He is indeed the great hero, who shines there.
8.8.39	He pleases him alone.
8.8.40	The form of him alone is made.
8.9.1	The Upasads.
8.9.2	The Asuras built a city in these worlds.
8.9.3	Of iron in this world,
8.9.4	Of silver in the world of the atmosphere,
8.9.5	Of gold in heaven.
8.9.6	Those gods, in the worlds that were surrounded, saw this fifteenfold thunderbolt.
8.9.7	Three Sāmidhenī verses are recited, making nine.
8.9.8	Six Yajyā and Puronuvākyā verses.
8.9.9	They make fifteen.
8.9.10	By this fifteenfold thunderbolt, the gods drove away the Asuras from these worlds.
8.9.11	In the same way, the sacrificer, with this fifteen-fold thunderbolt, drives away his enemies, his adversaries, from these worlds.
8.9.12	One should recite this verse in the morning: "To the one who is near, to the one who is praised."
8.9.13	For these are the Upasads.
8.9.14	This rite is successful when it is recited at the beginning.
8.9.15	The day is as if it were the evening, with this sun.
8.9.16	"In the afternoon he says, "This my Agni, O Agni, is the form of that night."
8.9.17	"As if the Agni were burning in the evening."
8.9.18	Then on the second day.
8.9.19	"In morning he says, "O Agni, this my Agni is the form of this day."
8.9.20	The day is indeed like a fire that has been kindled by the sun.
8.9.21	In the evening he recites, "To the one who is to be approached, to the one who is praised." This is the form for that night.
8.9.22	"One approaches this Agni in the evening as if to be approached."
8.9.23	These are indeed the two forms that are known.
8.9.24	Therefore one should recite the verses in reverse order every day.
8.9.25	The two forms of Kama are attained by the two forms of Kama.
8.10.1	One should recite the Anvanam for the continuity of the vital airs.
8.10.2	For the vital airs are indeed continuous.
8.10.3	One should repeat each one three times.
8.10.4	There are three worlds here.
8.10.5	One attains these worlds.
8.10.6	When recited together, they become nine.
8.10.7	There are six seasons and three worlds.
8.10.8	They attain this very thing.
8.10.9	One should not utter this statement among the Sāman-verses.
8.10.10	The statements are abandoned.
8.10.11	One who utters this statement would be a son-in-law.
8.10.12	Some say, one should not invoke.
8.10.13	How can one conquer without invoking the deity?
8.10.14	One should invoke the Rk.
8.10.15	"He brings Agni, he brings Soma, he brings Vishnu."
8.10.16	He offers to three deities.
8.10.17	There are three worlds.
8.10.18	He makes these worlds luminous.
8.11.1	The two (verses) for Agni are in the Gāyatrī metre.
8.11.2	This world is Gāyatrī.
8.11.3	He attains this world.
8.11.4	The two for Soma are in the Tristubh metre.
8.11.5	The Tristubh is the world of the atmosphere.
8.11.6	He attains that world of the atmosphere
8.11.7	The Jagati is the world of Vishnu.
8.11.8	The world of Vishnu is the world of heaven.
8.11.9	He attains the world of heaven
8.11.10	They are reversed.
8.11.11	Those which are the Puronuvakya in the forenoon, he makes them the Yajya in the afternoon.
8.11.12	Those which were the Yajya, he makes them Puronuvakyas.
8.11.13	For the sake of non-exhaustion.
8.11.14	The Rk becomes exhausted by the Vasat-call on the same day.
8.11.15	"May my Vasat-call be not exhausted."
8.11.16	When he turns around, it is for the stability of the neck.
8.11.17	Therefore the joints of the necks of the cows are like those of the necks of goats.
8.11.18	The deities are of ghee as oblation.
8.11.19	The sacrificer is of milk diet.
8.11.20	That is with hair.
8.11.21	He should accept the three breasts first, then two, then one.
8.11.22	He thus makes the worlds mutually superior.
8.11.23	One should not raise them up.
8.11.24	Those who perform the Upasads are indeed going to the heavenly world.
8.12.1	The heavenly world is indeed twelve-fold.
8.12.2	He who raises them up once,
8.12.3	Just as one would follow a caravan that has gone away for one night, so one should follow it.
8.12.4	He who goes for the second time.
8.12.5	Just as one would follow it for two nights, so one should do it.
8.12.6	It is diminished by the third.
8.12.7	He does not attain the heavenly worlds.
8.12.8	Pingya said, "One should follow it."
8.12.9	But one should not take it up.
8.12.10	Wherever one desires.
8.12.11	He should go to the eastern direction and attain the world of heaven.
8.12.12	"Kausītaki said, "Completion is the best."
8.12.13	At the meal, they should offer curd to him, not during the vow.
8.12.14	Curd is Soma.
8.12.15	His meal is not interrupted, he attains completion.
8.12.16	Even if they were to buy it,
8.12.17	the middlemost meal
8.12.18	They should move around for two days.
8.12.19	It is the sowing of seeds.
8.12.20	This is for the world of the atmosphere.
8.12.21	Then he goes to the sky. Then he goes to the heaven.
9.1.1	Brahma is Agni.
9.1.2	When they place the fire on the Upavasatha day,
9.1.3	they remove the sin of the sacrificer by means of Brahma.
9.1.4	In front of the Āhavanīya
9.1.5	Then with the Garhapatya.
9.1.6	To the north with the Agnidhra.
9.1.7	To the south with the Marjaly.
9.1.8	Those who are inside the Sadas, with them in the middle.
9.1.9	Therefore on the Upavasatha day they carry the fire towards the east.
9.1.10	They carry the Dhishnyas.
9.1.11	For the sake of removing the sin of the sacrificer.
9.1.12	The gods, about to consecrate, withdrew speech.
9.1.13-20	You go to many high and low places. We are indeed made of truth, we are made of intoxication, we desire to shine." She wanted to be worshipped at the consecration. The gods did not worship her there. She wanted to worship her at the Pravargya. She wanted her to worship her at that place. She wanted worship her at the Atithya. She wanted him to worship her at this place. He did not come to the Upasads, and became disappointed.
9.1.21	Therefore they should perform the Upāṁśu there.
9.1.22	So that they may hear each other.
9.2.1	That Agni, being taken to the Upasad, came there.
9.2.2	The gods worshipped him there.
9.2.3	Therefore one should recite loudly there at the very beginning.
9.2.4	So that those who have come may know that the sacrifice is not yet completed.
9.2.5	"The god, the god of the goddess," (thus) the third verse is recited in the direction of the Pravantu.
9.2.6	"We are in the place of Ida," thus he praises the Pravantu in the direction of Pravantu. "We are in the abode of Ida."
9.2.7	This is Ida.
9.2.8	For everything here is placed in her.
9.2.9	"Jatavedas, the knower of birth, has hidden us," thus he praises what is being hidden with the verse containing the word "hidden."
9.2.10	Agni, with all thy own deities, sit down, O Hotar, in thy own world, knowing, the appointed Hotar, in the Hotar's seat. With the Sannati verses he praises the Sannati.
9.2.11	Thou art the messenger, thou art our protector. With the messenger verses he concludes.
9.2.12	The verses are to be recited in unison.
9.2.13	What is in unison at a sacrifice, that is prosperous; for the prosperity of the sacrifice.
9.2.14	They are eight in number.
9.2.15	By means of these the gods attained all the eight directions.
9.2.16	In the same way the sacrificer attains all the eight directions by means of these.
9.2.17	Three times with the first, three times with the last, they amount to twelve.
9.2.18	Twelve months are a year.
9.2.19	For the attainment of the year.
9.2.20	These eighteen Gāyatrī verses are completed.
9.2.21	The Agniya is indeed the metres.
9.2.22	Those who have six equal metres, they complete the Gāyatrī.
9.2.23	Those who are seven, they complete the Uṣṇīsa.
9.2.24	Those who complete eight, they complete the Anuṣṭubh.
9.2.25	Those who know nine, they complete the Brihatī.
9.2.26	Those who possess ten, they complete the Paṅkti.
9.2.27	Whose eleven are Tristubh.
9.2.28	Whose twelve are Jagatī.
9.3.1	Speech and mind are in the Havirdhāna.
9.3.2	And in speech and mind, all this is placed.
9.3.3	When they set up the Havirdhānā,
9.3.4	For the attainment of all desires.
9.3.5	There are two Havirdhānās.
9.3.6	The third is the covering.
9.3.7	Whatever is of three kinds, pertaining to the gods, pertaining to the self, he obtains all that.
9.3.8	He recites the Pravartiya verses beginning with "To the departed one of the sacrifice" and ending with "To the one who is to be praised."
9.3.9	"May heaven and earth, the two, bestow upon us this (food) which is like ghee and milk."
9.3.10	The first verse is auspicious.
9.3.11	Then the verses pertaining to the two deities are recited at the two Havirdhāna sheds.
9.3.12-16	The Adhvaryu offers the oblation on the path, and the Pratiprasthātṛ follows it with the subsequent verse. When they move the Havirdhāna cart, then with the subsequent verse (the Adhvaryu) follows it. When he praises the Havirdhānā cart with the verse, "When the gods were striving like Yama," then with the corresponding verse (the Pratiprasthātr) follows it. "May men, desiring you, carry you." For many carry it.
9.3.17	The two (priests) have placed the Uthyas (verses) in the middle, the wise one has released all forms.
9.3.18	What is the third (verse) that they place at the end, that he recites with the former (verse).
9.3.19	What they place on the sacrificial post, that with the latter (verse).
9.3.20	Or with the Raraṭyā (verse) alone.
9.3.21	When they think here, 'We will not go astray',
9.3.22	When they do it on the cloud.
9.3.23	Then, indeed, you are near to us, without injury.
9.3.24	When there is peace, then it is near.
9.3.25	"He places (the pot) around with the verse, "The mountains surround thee, O lover of mountains," with the verse containing the word 'around'.
9.3.26	He recites the verse in a pleasing manner."
9.3.27	What is pleasing at a sacrifice, that is prosperous. For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
9.3.28	They are eight in number.
9.3.29	By means of these, the gods attained all the eight worlds.
9.3.30	In the same way, the sacrificer, by means of these (verses), attains all the eight stages.
9.3.31	Three times with the first (verse), three times with the last (verse), twelve are completed.
9.3.32	Twelve months are a year.
9.3.33	For the attainment of the year.
9.3.34	And why there are three times with the first and three times with the final (verse),
9.3.35	It is for the stability of the sacrifice, for its non-falling.
9.3.36	They address the Hotṛ thus: "O Hotṛ, do as you think best for our safety."
9.3.37	Having been sent forth, he steps back from the right foot, and turns towards the western direction.
9.3.38	"The slayer of Vṛtra has removed the fear of one's own and others, and has turned away from the fear."
9.3.39	From here onwards is the practice of the wheel.
9.3.40	From here onwards one is safe from danger.
9.3.41	He should place himself on the northern side of the southern Havirdhāna (shed) facing the east.
9.3.42	This world is the southern Havirdhana.
9.3.43	This world indeed is the foundation.
9.3.44	One who is not cut off from the foundation is firm.
9.3.45	If one were to place oneself at a place where one stands,
9.3.46	one would be about to fall.
9.3.47	Therefore, having put down the right arm, having turned around, and having returned as he came,
9.3.48	he stands where he first spoke.
9.3.49	Standing there, he performs the Agnihotra and the Praharana.
9.3.50	Then he goes to his house.
9.4.1	Brahma is Agni, Soma is Kshatra.
9.4.2	Therefore, on the Upavasatha day, they offer Agni and Soma.
9.4.3	The Brahman and the Kshatra remove the sin of the sacrificer.
9.4.4	They say, the Hotri should recite this first verse while seated.
9.4.5	All beings follow the king Soma when it is being taken out.
9.4.6	When the Hotri recites this verse while seated,
9.4.7	That is the same as all beings, as their respective abodes.
9.4.8	"The first (verse) is Savitri, the first (verse) of the father, the god."
9.4.9	For the sake of being born by Savitri.
9.4.10	For one born by Savitri, there is no misfortune at all; for the sake of being without misfortune.
9.4.11	"He makes him rise with the verse, "Rise, O Brahmanaspati!" He makes him go forward with the verse, "May Brahmanaspati go forward!" He recites the two verses addressed to Brahmanaspati.
9.4.12	Brahmanaspati is Brahman.
9.4.13	He thus makes the sacrifice complete by means of Brahman.
9.4.14	He recites the two Anushtubh verses addressed to Agni, "The Hotr, the immortal god, has come to you, O Agni, from heaven to heaven."
9.4.15	For Agni is indeed taken first.
9.4.16	They become the ones who have come here.
9.4.17	For he praises Agni as being taken.
9.4.18	He says, "Where he may reach, he places the embryo of beings."
9.4.19	One should meditate on the embryo for one who desires a child.
9.4.20	One does obtain a child.
9.4.21	Then they place the fire in the Agnidhra (chamber).
9.4.22	The Adhvaryu offers a libation there.
9.4.23	Now he should recite this verse: "O Agni, accept and repel that speech."
9.4.24	This is the same verse as the one recited before. "Accept and repel" is the same as "Accept and repel."
9.5.1	Then they carry the Soma only, facing east.
9.5.2	Therefore one should recite the Somi verses only.
9.5.3	"Soma knows the way of going" - reciting this verse, one follows the previous verse.
9.5.4	Then the Adhvaryu offers a second oblation on the Ahavaniya fire.
9.5.5	One should recite this verse in response to that: "He has come to the beloved, the sloping one."
9.5.6	This is the same as the Yajya-oblation.
9.5.7	Then they lead the king through the eastern door.
9.5.8	When he is being led, the king says: "Varuna is this, the Asvins are this."
9.5.9	And to the village, O Vishnu, do thou give me a friend. Thus he recites the verse which is being recited in the proper form.
9.5.10	And at the end, the verse "Thou art the first of the gods" is recited to the one who has approached.
9.5.11	The hawk has made his nest with wisdom. We invoke thee, the lord of hosts, the knower of all. The Asura has supported the heaven. With the verses beginning with "Sannat" he praises the one who is established.
9.5.12	"Thus do thou worship Varuna, the great one." He places (the Soma) with a benediction.
9.5.13	One should recite the verses in accordance with the form.
9.5.14	Whatever is in accordance with the Yajna, that is prosperous. For the prosperity of the Yajna.
9.5.15	They recite twenty verses.
9.5.16	They attain Viraj.
9.5.17	Soma is Viraj.
9.5.18	Viraj is food, Soma is food.
9.5.19	With food, he nourishes that food.
9.5.20	Three times with the first (verse) and three times with the last (verse), twenty-four are completed.
9.5.21	Twenty-four are the half-months of the year.
9.5.22	For the attainment of the year itself.
9.5.23	If they were to lead the king through the eastern gate,
9.5.24	or if through the western gate,
9.5.25	the Hotṛ would follow through the same gate.
9.5.26	The Hotṛ is the self of the sacrifice.
9.5.27	Soma is the breath.
9.5.28	"So that he may not injure himself by the breath."
9.5.29	Standing to the north, he places it to the south.
9.5.30	Soma is indeed fame. The king is the present.
9.5.31	He indeed brings fame from afar to himself. He brings fame.
10.1.1	The sacrificial post is indeed a thunderbolt.
10.1.2	When they erect the sacrificial post on the day before the sacrifice,
10.1.3	With the thunderbolt they strike off the sacrificer's sin.
10.1.4	It should not be too low.
10.1.5	This is the form of hunger.
10.1.6	It should be bent down like the belly.
10.1.7	Then he returns to the Ahavaniya fire.
10.1.8	This is indeed the form of good health.
10.1.9	The wives of him who makes the sacrificial post in this form become hungry.
10.1.10	One desiring Brahmic glory should make it from Palasa wood.
10.1.11	One desiring food should make it from Vaim wood.
10.1.12	One desirous of heaven should make it from Khadira wood.
10.1.13	It should be three cubits in length, resembling the form of the worlds.
10.1.14	It should have four cubits, resembling the form (of the world) of animals.
10.1.15	It should measure five cubits, resembling (the form) of the rows (of the world).
10.1.16	It should measure six cubits, resembling(the form) of seasons.
10.1.17	It should (measure) seven cubits, resembling form of the Vedas.
10.1.18	The post is eight cubits in length, in the form of the Gāyatrī metre.
10.1.19	It is nine cubits in length in the form of Bṛhatī metre.
10.1.20	It has ten cubits in length as the form of Virāj.
10.1.21	It is eleven cubits in length with the form of Tristubh.
10.1.22	It is twelve cubits in length having the form of Jagatī.
10.2.1	These are the measures of the post.
10.2.2	One should make the post after completing one of these measures.
10.2.3	They say, one should not cut the sacrificial post.
10.2.4	It should be unlimited.
10.2.5	One who is limited conquers one who is limited.
10.2.6	One who has no limit conquers one who has no limit.
10.2.7	For the securing of the unlimited.
10.2.8	One should do it where one thinks the boundary of the mind.
10.2.9	This is the boundary of the sacrificial post and the boundary of the boundary, so it is said.
10.2.10	Prajapati is the mind.
10.2.11	Prajapति is the sacrifice.
10.2.12	The sacrifice itself enjoys the sacrifice.
10.2.13	What the mind is of the mind.
10.2.14	The sacrificial post for the Vājapeya sacrifice is fixed at seventeen cubits.
10.2.15	It is fixed as having eight corners.
10.2.16	For the fulfilment of all desires.
10.2.17	Then he makes it fall down.
10.2.18	Whatever this is made of, it becomes like a piece of wood made rough with an axe, like a piece of metal melted.
10.2.19	That very thing nourishes him, and that very thing heals him.
10.2.20	Then he anoints him.
10.2.21	Those very waters which are in the man,
10.2.22	he places them in him.
10.2.23	The sacrificer himself should anoint himself.
10.2.24	Thus the sacrificer becomes as if not dry.
10.3.1	"They anoint thee at the sacrifice, O god-desiring one," (thus) he recites to the anointed, the beautiful, the flowing.
10.3.2	"Grow up, O tree, growing up in the fire, born before, thou art born again for the good days. The high, the high, the high ones, the high ones protect us. The high ones protect us from the evil ones." He recites the verses of the growing up of the high ones and the high ones.
10.3.3	"The young one, in new clothes, has come around." He places the one with the verse "The young one, etc."
10.3.4	The Anväh is beautiful.
10.3.5	Whatever is beautiful at a sacrifice, that is prosperous. For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
10.3.6	They are seven Anvähs.
10.3.7	There are seven metres.
10.3.8	For the attainment of all metres.
10.3.9	Three times with the first, three times with the last, they become eleven.
10.3.10	The Tristubh has eleven syllables.
10.3.11	The animals are of the Tristubh metre, for the attainment of animals.
10.3.12	Thus indeed in the case of one stake and one animal.
10.3.13	Now if they were to offer one animal at one stake,
10.3.14	the Adhvaryu would instruct at each animal.
10.3.15	At each animal the young one in new clothes would come forth, having been enclosed. That is the enclosing (verse). It is for the one being enclosed.
10.3.16	Thus indeed at one stake.
10.3.17	Now how is it in the Yūpaikādashi?
10.3.18	One should recite these seven after the seventeen.
10.3.19	Now when they are binding the last (animal),
10.3.20	one should recite the remaining part of the Sūkta before the Prāgātha, "They saw the horned ones with horns" (RV 10.129.1), he recites all.
10.3.21	The young one, well-dressed, comes around, thus it is the garment. It is for one who is being dressed.
10.4.1	They say one should strike it.
10.4.2	The sacrificial post is indeed the patron.
10.4.3	The Āhavanīya fire is heaven.
10.4.4	He indeed sends him to that heaven.
10.4.5	That is the heavenly one.
10.4.6	They say he should stand.
10.4.7	If this is the place of sacrifice, and if the gods do not descend upon the demons and fiends,
10.4.8	then let this thunderbolt-wielding one stand at the sacrificial site, destroying the demons and fiendes, warding off, and protecting the sacrifice and the sacrificer.
10.4.9	Then there is one for the sacrificial post, one for the substance, and one for the pit.
10.4.10	He who has a lower-hanging branch is a ditch.
10.4.11	One should not go to his shadow.
10.4.12	Now he who has an upward-hanging branch, that substance is human.
10.4.13	One may do it for him too.
10.4.14	Now he whose branches are covered and those of his are uncovered,
10.4.15	He is a sacrificial post, he is heavenly, he is one-standing, he is an enemy.
10.4.16	He who is covered with leaves up to the root,
10.4.17	He who is not Agni is the one who is fit for animals.
10.4.18	One who desires animals should perform this.
10.5.1	One who consecrates himself becomes the mouth of Agni and Soma.
10.5.2	Therefore, on the Upavasatha day, one offers a Soma-Agni animal.
10.5.3	This is indeed a redemption of oneself. Having redeemed oneself, one becomes debt-free and then performs the sacrifice.
10.5.4	Therefore, one should not eat it.
10.5.5	The man is indeed the image of that.
10.5.6	They say that the sacrifice is the redemption of the self.
10.5.7	One should eat only the sacrifice, if it is the redemption of oneself.
10.5.8	One should not eat if it is the sacrifice.
10.5.9	Therefore one should eat only what one desires.
10.5.10	The Agni and Soma are indeed the day and night.
10.5.11	When they move with the oblation during the day,
10.5.12	That day is pleasing to Agni.
10.5.13	He completes the night.
10.5.14	That night is pleasing to Soma.
10.5.15	This is the release from day and night.
10.5.16	One is released from day and night by means of the sacrifice.
10.5.17	They do not attain him.
10.5.18	He who, knowing this, offers this animal sacrifice,
10.6.1	They say, "It is of two forms, white and black, by the forms of day and night."
10.6.2	"White and red, by the forms Agni and Soma."
10.6.3	It has eleven Prayājas, eleven Anuyājas, and eleven Upāṃśus.
10.6.4	They are thirty-three.
10.6.5	The thirty-three are all the gods.
10.6.6	For the satisfaction of all the gods.
10.6.7	The Prāṇas are the Prāyājas, the Apānas are the Anuyājas.
10.6.8	Therefore they are equal.
10.6.9	For these Prāṇas and Apānas are equal.
10.6.10	They say, why does one offer the Prāyāja with a verse and the Anuyāja with a formula?
10.6.11	The Prāyājas are the impregnation of semen.
10.6.12	The Anuyājas are the retention of semen.
10.6.13	Therefore one offers the Prāyāgas with a verse and Anuyājas with a formula.
10.6.14-21	Now, as to why he says everything that is best. He places the sacrificer in heaven itself. He satisfies with the Apryas. For he who sacrifices with the whole of his self, with the whole of the mind, gathers the sacrifice. His self becomes as if it were swollen. He satisfies him with these Apryas. This is why he satisfies him. Because he satisfies him, therefore the name Apryas. 
10.7.1	He makes the animal go around the fire for the removal of the Rākṣasas.
10.7.2	For Agni is the remover of the Rākşasas.
10.7.3	He makes the animal go round the fire three times.
10.7.4	So that he would make three fires in front of him.
10.7.5	Therefore one should say to the Agnidh, "Do not go away again."
10.7.6	If one wishes that he should not go away.
10.7.7	The divine and human controllers of the sacrifice, do you begin, do you bring (the Soma), for the one who desires, for the lords of wisdom, the wisdom.
10.7.8	They say about this:
10.7.9	The sacrificer is the lord of wisdom.
10.7.10	If someone were to say: Who is the human?
10.7.11	The deity is the lord of the wisdom.
10.7.12	His Vankraya is twenty-six.
10.7.13	The sides are the Vankraya.
10.7.14	The two sides are covered with blood.
10.7.15	For the Rakshas are the receptacles of blood.
10.7.16	"So that the divine share may not be connected with the share of the Rakshas."
10.7.17	This is the Adhrigu.
10.7.18	"Do not cut off my limbs."
10.7.19	What is not defiled is the oblation of the gods.
10.7.20	They do not eat the defiled oblation.
10.7.21	Nine times he says, "The cow is mine."
10.7.22	These are the nine vital airs.
10.7.23	He thus places the vital airs in the sacrificer.
10.7.24	For all-pervasiveness in this world,
10.7.25	for immortality in the other world.
10.7.26	He places them three times, for the sake of exclusion.
10.7.27	Once he says it in front.
10.7.28	The fathers are like once.
10.7.29	The animal is being offered as if to the Pitrs.
10.7.30	And when he says three times above,
10.7.31	it is for the three deities.
10.7.32	He thus makes it acceptable to the gods.
10.8.1	Having put on (the garment), he mutters inaudibly, "Both are free from sin."
10.8.2	For the gods have indeed made him free from sin.
10.8.3	Therefore he gives it to him.
10.8.4	For he knows the gods.
10.8.5	Then the Stokyas recite.
10.8.6	With these (verses) he indeed pleases Agni with Stokyas.
10.8.7	These indeed are their Puronuvākyās and Yājyās.
10.8.8	Therefore they become similar.
10.8.9	Having performed with Svāhā-forms, they perform with Payas.
10.8.10	They make the Prayājas the share of the animals.
10.8.11	He should not utter any words between the offering of the oblation and the utterance of "svāhā".
10.8.12	The "svāhā" is the vital airs.
10.8.13	The "vaps" is the self.
10.8.14	So that he does not enclose the vital airs and the self with something else.
10.8.15	Now, why the verses of the Anushtubh metre are the Puronuvākyās of the Agniṣṭoma animal sacrifice.
10.8.16	The Anushtubh is the Gāyatrī.
10.8.17	The metre of Agni is the Gāyatra.
10.8.18	Now, the Yajya is in Tristubh.
10.8.19	The Tristubh is the metre of the Kshatriya.
10.8.20	Soma is the Kshatriya
10.8.21	Thus he pleases the deity according to the metre.
10.8.22	Now, when an animal is being offered, the Puronuvakya is recited.
10.8.23	Now, where the Puronuvakyas are recited,
10.8.24	there the Puronuvakiya-Svishtakrit is not omitted.
10.8.25	Agni is the bestower of good gifts.
10.8.26	Therefore one does not fall away from him.
10.8.27	Having recited the Puronuvākyā of the Vaishvamitra cake, he offers to Vaishvamitra.
10.8.28	The cake is the foundation of the sacrifice.
10.8.29	Vishvamitra is speech.
10.8.30	The sacrifice is supported by speech.
10.9.1	Then he recites the Manota.
10.9.2	All the gods approach the animal being sacrificed, thinking, "He will take my name."
10.9.3	The minds of all of them are concentrated on the animal.
10.9.4	She pleases them here.
10.9.5	Thus for all of them it becomes a successful approach.
10.9.6-10	They say, "If animals are offered to different deities, why is it that one offers only to Agni?" There are three things that are dear to the gods. Agni is dear to the gods, for in him their minds and thoughts flow. And speech is dear to the gods,
10.9.11	For their minds are attached to it.
10.9.12	And indeed, the cow is the mind-offering of the gods.
10.9.13	For their minds are attached in it.
10.9.14	Agni is the mind-offerer of all.
10.9.15	The mind-offerings meet in Agni.
10.9.16	Therefore one offers to Agni alone.
10.9.17	They are thirteen in number.
10.9.18	There are thirteen offerings of the animal.
10.9.19	Three times with the first, three times with the last, they amount to seventeen.
10.9.20	Prajapati is seventeenfold.
10.9.21	This is the work of success, namely, that which is equal to Prajapati.
10.9.22	One should recite seventeen Sāmidhenī verses.
10.9.23	Prajapti is seventeenfold.
10.9.24	This is the most worthy rite, which is equal to Prajapati.
10.9.25	Now, where an animal is sacrificed,
10.9.26	That is the imperishable Vanaspati.
10.9.27	Vanaspati is Agni.
10.9.28	He cooks the oblation for the gods.
10.10.1	Therefore, he becomes imperishable.
10.10.2	He is the vessel of milk.
10.10.3	Here Agni becomes a sharer in all the oblations.
10.10.4	They say, "Why is the tree the share of the Fathers?"
10.10.5	The gods took the share of the sacrifice.
10.10.6	The Fathers took the share of food.
10.10.7	The animal is as it were connected with the Fathers.
10.10.8	The milk is connected with the Fathers
10.10.9	Therefore one should say,
10.10.10	They say, "Why do they offer the oblations at the Soma-sacrifice and not at the Havi-sacrifice?"
10.10.11	The Havi-sacrifice is incomplete in the offering to the gods.
10.10.12	But the Soma-sacrifice is complete in the offering to gods.
10.10.13	Therefore they offer the oblation at the Soma-sacrifiice and not at the Havı-sacrifice.
10.10.14	May I be acceptable to speech, may I be acceptable to the lord of speech, O goddess Speech.
10.10.15	Whatever is the sweetest of your speech, in that may you bless us today. Svāhā to Sarasvatī. He offers with the word Svāhā at the beginning.
10.10.16	He releases speech from that.
10.10.17	Therefore, speech, released from that, carries the sacrifice.
10.10.18	The next one is of the mind.
10.10.19	The mind is pleased with the mind. The mind is pleased.
11.1.1	Now, then, the morning recitation.
11.1.2	What he recites in the morning,
11.1.3	that is the reason for the morning recitation being called morning recitation.
11.1.4	And what he murmurs in the morning, what oblations he offers,
11.1.5	he makes it conducive to welfare.
11.1.6	He recites the morning recitation with the sound "hiṃ".
11.1.7	The sound "hiṃ" is the thunderbolt.
11.1.8	By means of the thunderbolt, he destroys the sin of the sacrificer.
11.1.9	One should recite the high-sounding (verses).
11.1.10	This is the only verse of speech that is not connected with sin, namely, the high-sounding one.
11.1.11	Therefore, one should recite the high sounding one.
11.1.12	For the removal of the sin of the Sacrificer.
11.1.13	One shall recite in half-verses.
11.1.14-20	The worlds are measured by the Rk verses. This world is the first half-verse. The other world is the second half-verse. And what is between the two half-verses, that is this atmosphere. And when he recites the two half- verses, he thus makes the sacrificer prosper in these worlds. He thus places the sacrificer in these worlds.
11.2.1	Now, indeed, there are five positions of the Panka (i.e. the Pancamas). How does it become recited in half-verses?
11.2.2	The third is after the Pranava.
11.2.3	Thus it becomes recited in half-verse.
11.2.4	Recite the Agniya Kratu.
11.2.5	One attains this world by that.
11.2.6	Recite Ushasya.
11.2.7	One attains the world of the atmosphere by that.
11.2.8	One recites Ashvina.
11.2.9	He attains that world.
11.2.10	He recites the Gayatri verse.
11.2.11	The mouth itself is the Gayatri.
11.2.12	He recitess the Anushtubh verse.
11.2.13	Speech is the Anushtubha.
11.2.14	He places speech in the mouth.
11.2.15	One speaks with the mouth.
11.2.16	He recits the Tristubh verse.
11.2.17	Strength and valour are the Tristubh.
11.2.18	He recitas the Brihaty verse.
11.2.19	The cow and horse are the Brihaty.
11.2.20	He recites the Uṣṇīṣa verse.
11.2.21	The Uṣṇīsa verse is indeed the goat.
11.2.22	He recites the Jagatī verse.
11.2.23	The Jagatī verse is indeed strength and valour.
11.2.24	The strength and valour are in the beginning, in the Tristubh verse.
11.2.25	The strength, valour are above, in the Jagatī.
11.2.26	The animals are in the middle, in the Bṛhatī and Uṣṇīșa verses.
11.2.27	He thus encloses the animals on both sides with strength and valour and places them in the sacrificer.
11.2.28	and the animals of the sacrificer do not go away.
11.2.29	Just as in this world men eat animals, so in the other world the animals eat men, and they eat them.
11.2.30	Those whom he binds here in the morning with the morning recitation, they are bound here and do not eat in the other world.
11.2.31	They do not enjoy them.
11.2.32	Just as he eats them in this world and enjoys them, so also he eats them in the other world.
11.2.33	Just as he eats them in this world, and just as he eats with them, in the same way he eats them in the other world, and in the same way they eat with him.
11.2.34	One should recite the Paṅkti verse.
11.2.35	The Paṅkti is indeed a foundation.
11.2.36	In that way, he establishes the sacrificer in all the beings.
11.3.1	Now all the deities, expecting the Hotṛ to recite the Prātaranuvāka, stand up to meet him, saying, "He will recite with me; he will recite with me."
11.3.2	If he were to recite after having specified one deity, he would be excluded from the other deities.
11.3.3	He recites with the Anirukta (hymn).
11.3.4	By that he is not excluded from any deity.
11.3.5-11	"The waters, the Revatī, are yours, O Vasu, to enjoy." He recites this verse. The waters are all the deities. He thus approaches all the deities. He recites the verse, "Approaching, they offer the sacrifice." He thus approaches. "Approaching" is the form of this world, "offering" is the form beyond. "Approching" is the form here, "offering" the form beyond. "Approaching" is Agni's form, "offering" beyond. "Offering" is the form yonder of the sun.
11.3.12	In the same way in all the Parvan days and in all the seasons.
11.4.1	In the Agni-parvan of the Ashvina month, the first Vyahrti is Agni's form, the second is Aditya's form.
11.4.2	And these two are different metres, as if separated by a creator.
11.4.3	And these are the strongest, the most auspicious, the most harmless deities.
11.4.4	One attains them.
11.4.5	One should ascend with the same verse.
11.4.6	That is the form of iron that is not to be made, which is heavenly.
11.4.7	Where there is a verse of the sage, one should pass over it without interruption.
11.4.8	The breath is indeed immortal.
11.4.9	By the immortal one crosses over death.
11.4.10	Just as one would pass over a hole or a ditch, so does one do that.
11.4.11	One passes over it with the Pranava.
11.4.12	Brahma is indeed the Pranava.
11.4.13	By means of Brahma, he attains that Brahma.
11.5.1	The Pranava should be pure for those who desire offspring, and ending with the letter Ma for those who desire stability.
11.5.2	Some say that the Pranava should end with the letter Ma.
11.5.3	But it is indeed established as pure.
11.5.4	The Pranavah has been examined.
11.5.5	Now, here it is pure, here it is full.
11.5.6	The Praṇava is pure, as Kauṣītaki has said, “Between the two recitations of the mantra.”
11.5.7	Thus it becomes a collection.
11.5.8	The syllable Ma ends with the meaning of cessation.
11.5.9	Cessation is indeed establishment. By establishment, one attains both desires.
11.5.10	These indeed are the streams of the Vedas.
11.5.11	The lower Veda and the higher Veda flow beyond.
11.5.12	There is no distress for him whose desire is fulfilled by the Chandaḥ.
11.5.13	One should mentally pierce with the Chandaḥ the one whom one hates too much.
11.5.14	It is said, "He moves or is scattered."
11.5.15	One should recite the highest rites of the Pāṅktis, which have the same goal.
11.5.16	The goal is indeed the essence.
11.5.17	The Chandaḥs are the animals.
11.5.18	The metres return to the essence.
11.5.19	The cattle seem to return.
11.6.1	They delight in the Sūyavasa.
11.6.2	The Viraj is one less, repeated twice.
11.6.3	The Viraja is complete, repeated thrice.
11.6.4	One exceeds the Viraj.
11.6.5	There are three desires in the sacrifice: the fulfilled, the deficient, and the excessive.
11.6.6	Whatever is complete in the sacrifice is heavenly.
11.6.7	Whatever is deficient is food.
11.6.8	Whatever is in excess is for progeny.
11.6.9	Herein the sacrificer obtains all his desires.
11.6.10	He places it with the benediction, "This is the animal of the Rushads."
11.6.11	He thus expresses a benediction for the animals.
11.6.12	Thus indeed, the animals do not go away from the sacrificer.
11.6.13	He releases speech in that (Sāman).
11.6.14	He thereby informs the gods that he is born.
11.6.15	For here one is born.
11.6.16	He recites the two-footed verse, 'I am going to obtain the divine boon, the strength.'
11.6.17	The four-footed verses are the metres of animals.
11.6.18	The two-footed verse is the metre of the sacrificer.
11.6.19	He places the sacrificer among the animals, having presided over them.
11.6.20	For man stands over the animals.
11.7.1	He recites the metres of the sacrifices three times seven.
11.7.2	That makes twenty-one.
11.7.3	The twenty-one is the highest of the Stomas.
11.7.4	He attains the highest Stoma.
11.7.5	Now, as to why there are twenty-one (verses), twelve months, five seasons, and these three worlds.
11.7.6	The sun is the twenty-first.
11.7.7	By means of that he makes the sacrificer ascend to that world.
11.7.8	They say, "What are the Samidhenis in the case of this Agnihotra or animal sacrifice? And what are they in the case of the Soma sacrifice?"
11.7.9	One should say, "The Prātaranuvāka."
11.7.10	The other (verses) are sought for by syllables, but here (they are sought for) by the Rg verses.
11.7.11	One should recite a hundred times.
11.7.12	Man has a life span of a hundred years.
11.7.13	He places that life in him.
11.7.14	One should repeat twenty times.
11.7.15	There are twenty times a hundred days in a year.
11.7.16	He attains the season, the year by the season.
11.7.17-22	Those who desire the year should recite three hundred and sixty. There are three hundred and sixty days in a year. One attains the days of the year. One should recite two thousand and seventy. There are two thousand and seventy day-and-nights in a year. One attains the day-and-night of the year. 
11.8.1	One should recite a thousand times.
11.8.2	All that is a thousand.
11.8.3	All is the morning recitation.
11.8.4	He who knows this obtains everything with everything.
11.8.5	Now indeed Kauṣītaki said this:
11.8.6	The morning recitation is indeed Prajapati.
11.8.7	Prajapati is indeed unlimited.
11.8.8	Who is worthy to measure him?
11.8.9	This indeed is the state.
11.8.10	They say that the praises are sung by the members. But why is the morning-hymn recited at the Havirdhāna shed?
11.8.11	The Havirdhāna sheds are the head of the sacrifice.
11.8.12	The morning-hymn is speech.
11.8.13	He thus makes the head complete by speech.
11.8.14	The Sadas is the belly.
11.8.15	The praises are food.
11.8.16	The belly is the receptacle of food.
11.8.17	The sacrifice is indeed like that.
11.8.18	Just as grain, so the morning recitation.
11.8.19	Just as vessels, so the hymns.
11.8.20	He who recites less, his hymns are like vessels made of less grain.
11.8.21	The hymns are like a battle. The sacrificer is the lord. The fault follows him.
11.8.22	They say, one should recite many (verses).
11.8.23	It increases the praises.
11.8.24	"May the blessing of the prosperous sacrifice prosper for me."
11.8.25	The blessing of the prosperous sacrifices is for the sacrificer.
11.9.1	And these three thousand are the highest sacrifice:
11.9.2	The morning recitation, the Asvins, and the Great Vrata.
11.9.3	One should recite this eulogy before the great night, or before the release of speech.
11.9.4	Where the animals, the men, and the creatures speak, before that.
11.9.5	One who speaks the speech of the Apinas (sages) first succeeds.
11.9.6	One does not release speech between the morning recitation, the Upāṁśu and the Antaryāma.
11.9.7	The Prāṇāpāna and Upāṃśu and Antaryāma are the two breaths.
11.9.8	The Prātaranuvāka is speech.
11.9.9	So that the Prāṇāpaṇa and speech are not separated by anything else.
11.9.10	Some, having recited the verse "Who knows the union of the Vedas, he is wise," then begin with the verse "O waters, the Revatī, you are the wealth of Indra."
11.9.11	One should not offer anything before the Revatī waters.
12.1.7	In the beginning, they used to protect the sacrifices and the waters at the sacred places.
12.1.8	Those who went to the waters, they killed all of them.
12.1.9	Kavasa saw this hymn of fifteen verses, "May the praise come to the divine Brahman."
12.1.10	He spoke about it.
12.1.11	With that Yajamana-face, he drove away the demons from the sacred places.
12.1.12	Then indeed, from here on, they return safely and without mishap.
12.1.13	Then the Adhvaryu offers a libation in the waters beyond this.
12.1.14	One should recite this very one.
12.2.1	"O Hinautā, do thou offer our sacrifice for the worship of the gods."
12.2.2	This is the same as the Yajya of the Devayajya.
12.2.3	"When they flow in two directions, having turned back."
12.2.4	"When they are seen flowing back."
12.2.5	"Some flow together, others flow separately."
12.2.6	"The divine waters flow to the Hotr's cup."
12.2.7	The cows, with their milk, have come quickly to the goal.
12.2.8	The waters are the cows.
12.2.9	For the waters support all this.
12.2.10	Then the Adhvaryu, having turned around, stands facing the Hotri.
12.2.11	The Hotri asks him, "O Adhvaryu! Have you brought the waters?"
12.2.12	He means, "Have you brought the sacrifice?"
12.2.13	He replies, "We have brought the food."
12.2.14	We do not know what that is, but in the waters he who seeks it finds it. Therefore he says this to him.
12.2.15	The Hotṛ, having been addressed, responds with this statement.
12.2.16	The statement is indeed nourishment and sap.
12.2.17	He thus places nourishment and sap in the oblation with the statement.
12.2.18	"They go to the waters with the rites."
12.2.19	The waters are indeed the Ambayas.
12.2.20	The waters are praised.
12.2.21	"They have come to the auspicious ones, the givers of life."
12.2.22	"They have reached the waters, the auspicious ones, this is the sacrificial grass."
12.2.23	One should recite in accordance with the form.
12.2.24	Whatever is in accordance with the sacrifice is prosperous, for the prosperity of the sacrifice.
12.3.1	The morning recitation was recited.
12.3.2-8	The hymns were not yet attained. The Asuras approached them in this (world). The gods, having awakened, saw this three-fold prosperous thunderbolt while frightened. "Water" - that is the first form of the thunderbolt. "Sarasvati" - that is its second form of the thunderbolt.
12.3.9	By this very same threefold prosperous thunderbolt the gods drove away the Asuras from these worlds.
12.3.10	In the same way the sacrificer drives away his enemies from these worlds by this very same threefold prospering thunderbolt.
12.3.11	The Madhyamas performed a Sattra on the Sarasvati.
12.3.12	Thereupon Kavasa sat down in the middle.
12.3.13	He then went to Hema.
12.3.14	"He said, "You are the son of a slave, we will not eat with you."
12.3.15	He, being angry, fled and praised Sarasvati with this hymn.
12.3.16	He then went to Heya.
12.3.17	Then they thought of Hema as if he were without sin.
12.3.18	Then they ran after him and said,
12.3.19	"O sage, salutations to you, do not abandon us.
12.3.20	"Thou art indeed the best of us, for this (Soma) follows thee."
12.3.21	They made him understand.
12.3.22	They appeased his anger.
12.3.23	This is the greatness of Kavasa and the Anuvetsin Sūkta.
12.4.1	When they go with their wives, the Gandharvas, who had been sent by Indra to guard the Soma in the water,
12.4.2	They were desirous of women.
12.4.3	They make their minds happy with them.
12.4.4	Just as one would bring a sacrifice to the negligent, so is it.
12.4.5	He becomes the sacrifice for him.
12.4.6	He recites twenty times.
12.4.7	They approach Viraj.
12.4.8	The waters are Viraj.
12.4.9	Viraj is food, the waters are food.
12.4.10	He thus prospers with food.
12.5.2	He should inhale while it is being offered. "Protect my life, O life-giver! Svāhā! You are the good-born one for the sun."
12.5.3	That itself is his Vaṣaṭkāra and Svāhākāra.
12.5.4	Indeed, those oblations do not reach the gods if they are not offered with Vaṣaṭ or Svāhā.
12.5.5	The inner restraint is the out-breath alone.
12.5.6	When it is offered, the out-breath follows it. Protect my out-breath, invigorate my out-breath. Svāhā to thee, O well-born, for the sun.
12.5.7	That very is his Vasat-call and Svāhā-call.
12.5.8	Indeed, those oblations do not go to the gods which are not offered with Vasat or Svāhā.
12.5.9	Those two are indeed the out-breath and in-breath, which are the Upāṃśu and Antaryāma.
12.5.10	Or, when one of them rises, the other sets, they offer to the other.
12.5.11	He thus separates these two, the out-breath and the in-breath.
12.5.12	For though these two, the in-breath and the out-breath, are together, yet they are not the same.
12.5.13	And when they offer to the one when it rises, and to the other when it sets, they thus separate the Asuras from the day and night.
12.5.14	For the sun is both day and night, and the sacrificer is the sin. So it is said.
12.5.15	Now he who offers to both of them when they have risen, or to both of them before they have risen, is a water-sacrificer, not a Soma-sacrificer.
12.5.16	He who offers to them as they are, is a Soma-sacrificor.
12.5.17	Thus indeed, in the case of Upāṁśu and Antaryāma.
12.6.1-6	"The Pavamāna is to be followed." They say, "It is not to be followed." The Rk is the abode of this (verse), where the Hotṛ recites it. Then the Saman is the abode of the Saman, where they sing the Saman. He who follows (the Hotṛ) causes the Rk to fall away from its abode. He makes the Rk follow the Saman.
12.6.7	Therefore one should not rise up.
12.6.8	"One should not cause the verse to fall away from its own place."
12.6.9	"One should cause the verse to follow the Sama."
12.6.10	But if the Hotṛ himself were to rise up, he should do so.
12.6.11	For his own place is the Upaga-tra.
12.6.12	The Svarga world is the Svarā, the Sama.
12.6.13	"One places oneself in the Svarga world, in the Svarā, in the Sama, saying, 'I am superior to myself."
12.6.14	Then at the Pavamāna (Sāman) all the deities are satisfied at the morning (Sāman).
12.6.15	How does one become un-eaten there?
12.7.1	He should recite this Japa at the Pavamana Sāman:
12.7.2	The gods have invited him to partake of this Soma, the purifying, the discerning. The gods have invited me to partake of this soma, the purifying, discerning. I partake of thee with my mind, I partake of thee by speech, I partake of tee by breath, I partake of te by sight, I partake of toe by hearing.
12.7.3	This is the invitation of the gods.
12.7.4	Thus the king Soma, the discerning one, is eaten, and the Moon, the eater, is eaten by the gods who eat the eater.
12.7.5	Now the animal.
12.7.6	This animal is indeed Soma himself.
12.7.7	It would be as if he were drinking water, if he did not obtain it.
12.7.8	He intensifies the pressing with this.
12.7.9-12	When they perform with the Vayu-oblations, thereby the morning pressing is intensified. When they cremate (the dead) and perform with the Pasupurodāsa, thereby the midday pressing is intensified. And when they perform with it at the third pressing, thereby the third pressing is intensified. This is the intensification of the pressings.
12.7.13	The gods who drink Soma, and those who partake of the animals, are the thirty-three gods who drink Soma.
12.7.14	Those who are connected with the Soma offerings are the eight Vasus, the eleven Rudras, the twelve Adityas, Indra as the thirty-second,
12.7.15	Prajapati as the thirty-third.
12.7.16	The thirty-three gods partake of the animals.
12.8.6	This is to be offered at the morning pressing.
12.8.7	They who make it other than Agni's, they take away what belongs to Agni and give it to another.
12.8.8	It is as if one were to take away what belongs of another and give it to still another.
12.8.9	One should not deviate from the Agnihotra even for a year.
12.8.10	For this is what some say.
12.8.11	The Agnēya is fixed in the Veda itself.
12.8.12	"The verse for the offering of the cake to Agni is, "The leaders of the sacrifice and the world of heaven."
12.8.13	The verse for the cake to Sukra is, "Do ye offer to Sukra, to the shining one."
12.8.14	The verse to the oblation is, "The singers, the poets, are singing."
12.8.15	They should offer the cake to Ekadasinī. This is the settled rule.
12.8.16	If the Prsthopāyanī is performed,
12.9.1	Now for the invocation.
12.9.2	"Bring the gods to the sacrificer."
12.9.3	"He invokes Agni, Agni, bring the tree-god, bring Indra with wealth." Thus he invokes the morning pressing.
12.9.4	"He invokes Indra with Rudra, thus he invokes the midday pressing."
12.9.5	He invites Indra, the lord of the sun, the lord of wealth, the lord of power, the lord of strength, the lord of Brihaspati, the lord of all gods. Thus he invites the third pressing.
12.9.6	Some people here invite the tree-god.
12.9.7	He should be invited at the end.
12.9.8	They say that he is worshipped at the third pressing. But they say:
12.9.9	The animal sacrifice is the self.
12.9.10	The breath is the tree.
12.9.11	If someone were to say there, "The self is within the breath," then one would not live.
12.9.12	Therefore, having approached the animal, the tree should be invoked.
12.9.13	The animal has been examined.
12.9.14	Prajapati, having created beings, seemed to be dissatisfied.
12.9.15	He thought, "How can I perform that sacrifice by which, having performed it, I may attain my desires and obtain food?"
12.9.16	He saw that it was a sacrifice of eleven (offerings).
12.9.17	He brought it.
12.9.18	He performed it.
12.9.19	Having performed it, he attained his desires and obtained food.
12.9.20	In the same way, the sacrificer, having performed this Ekādaśina sacrifice, attains his desires and obtains food.
12.10.1	For this Ekādaśinī sacrifice, the Yajya and Puronuvākyā verses are different.
12.10.2	And for the Manotā offering, the oblations are different.
12.10.3	The rest is common.
12.10.4	The first is dedicated to Agni.
12.10.5	Agni is indeed Brahman. For the attainment of Brahman-fame.
12.10.6	The second is Sarasvata.
12.10.7	Sarasvati is indeed speech.
12.10.8	This food is enjoyed by speech. For the attainment (of food).
12.10.9	The third is Saumya.
12.10.10	Soma is indeed the nobility. For the attainment(of food).
12.10.11	Fourth is Pouṣṇa.
12.10.12	Pūṣan is indeed food. For the attainment
12.10.13	The fifth is the one dedicated to Brihaspati.
12.10.14	Brihaspati is indeed Brahman. For the attainment of fame of Brahman.
12.10.15	The sixth is the one dedicated for all gods.
12.10.16	This food is eaten in various forms. For the attainment (of food).
12.10.17	The seventh is the one dedicated Indra.
12.10.18	Indra is indeed the nobility. For the attainment fame of nobility.
12.10.19	The eighth is the one dedicated Maruts.
12.10.20	The Maruts are indeed the waters.
12.10.21-25	The tenth is Savitr. The food eaten today is generated by Savitr. For the attainment of food. The eleventh is Varuna. Varuna is the Kshatra. For the attainment and protection of the fame of the Kshatra.
12.10.26	Thus indeed did Prajapati, taking food from both sides, with the Brahman and with the Kshatra, with the Kshattra and with the Brahman, came to a halt.
12.10.27	Thus indeed does the Sacrificer, taking food from the two sides, with the Brāhman and with the Ksatra, with the Ksatra and with the Brāhmaṇa, comes to a halt.
13.1.1	Prajapati is the sacrifice.
13.1.2	In him are all desires, all immortality.
13.1.3	His protectors are the Adhvaryus.
13.1.4	One about to enter the assembly hall salutes them, saying, "Salutations, salutations."
13.1.5	For the gods do not transgress salutations.
13.1.6	Having been saluted, they release the Hotri.
13.1.7	He approaches this Prajapati, the sacrifice.
13.1.8	Here the sacrificer obtains all his desires and attains immortality.
13.1.9	Then they perform the Havishpankti (rite).
13.1.10	The Havishpanktis are indeed cattle.
13.1.11	For the attainment of cattle.
13.1.12	There are five oblations: curd, cooked barley, parched grains, cake and milk.
13.1.13	The Pankti has five feet.
13.1.14	The sacrifice is fivefold.
13.1.15	The animals are the Paṅktis.
13.1.16	The man is the Paṅkti.
13.1.17	For the attainment of the sacrifice and the animals.
13.1.18	This is offered for the sake of the animals alone.
13.1.19	And also for the intensification of the Savanas.
13.1.20	And indeed the Havishpankti is the breath itself.
13.1.21	Therefore, the Hotṛ offers with the same instrument as the Maitrāvaruṇa directs.
13.1.22	For this breath is common.
13.2.1	They say, "The Rk which is recited in the morning becomes exhausted on that day. Then why is this Rk not exhausted in all the Savanas?"
13.2.2	He goes to the Savanas by dividing them. The morning Savana is the third Savana. Thus it is not exhausted.
13.2.3	They say, why is the Payasyā (Soma-draught) offered only in the morning, not in the midday or the third pressing?
13.2.4	Maitrāvaruṇa is indeed the sacrifice.
13.2.5	The sacrifice is born at the morning pressing.
13.2.6	The young boy is the receptacle of milk.
13.2.7	Just as one would give milk to a newborn child, so it is.
13.2.8	The Maitrāvaruṇa is old at the two later pressings.
13.2.9	When it grows too much, it becomes too strong.
13.2.10	Therefore, the Payasyā is offered in the morning, not at midday or at the third pressing.
13.3.1	He offers the Purorasa Svishtakrit oblation with the formula, "O Agni, do thou accept the oblation."
13.3.2	Avatsāra Prashravan was the Hotṛ of the gods.
13.3.3	Death overtook him in this splendour.
13.3.4	Agni is indeed death.
13.3.5	He, having pleased Agni with the oblation, saying, "O Agni, do thou take the oblation," was released.
13.3.6	In the same way, one who knows this, the Hotṛ, having pleased Agni, saying, "Do thou take the oblations," is released.
13.3.7	Indeed, through these intermediate spaces, the gods went to heaven.
13.3.8	Death has seized them in this light.
13.3.9	Agni is death.
13.3.10	They said, "O Agni, take the oblation!" Having pleased Agni with the oblation, they were released.
13.3.11	In the same way, one who knows this, the Hotṛ says, "O Agni take the oblation." Having pleased Agni with oblation, he is released.
13.3.12	These are the six syllables: "O Agni, do thou accept the oblation."
13.3.13	This self is six-limbed, six-fold.
13.3.14	Having redeemed himself by means of the self, having become debt-free, one then performs the sacrifice.
13.3.15	This is the mantra for the Avatsara Prashravana.
13.3.16	One should not think, "By whom or by what shall I perform the sacrifice?"
13.3.17	He should know that he is reciting the mantra composed by the sage and offering oblations.
13.3.18	Now we have spoken about Soma in relation to animals.
13.3.19	Similarly, about the Purushas.
13.4.1	These ten are the Soma-parts.
13.4.2	The Prati-part is the one that is being pressed.
13.4.3	The Trupta-part is the water.
13.4.4	The Rasa-part is the barley.
13.4.5	The Vrish-part is the Yava.
13.4.6	Soma is the ray, milk.
13.4.7	Jiva is the ray, cattle.
13.4.8	Amrita is the ray, gold.
13.4.9	The Rigveda is the ray, the Yajurveda is the ray and the Samaveda is the ray.
13.4.10	These indeed are the ten rays of Soma.
13.4.11	When all these come together,
13.4.12	then Soma is here, then Soma is pressed.
13.4.13	Having performed with the Puronuvakya offerings, they perform with the Dvidevata offerings.
13.4.14	The Puronuvakya-s are the Self of the sacrificer.
13.4.15	The Dvidevatyas are the breaths.
13.4.16	When one performs the Dvidevatyās after performing the Puronuvakyas,
13.4.17	then the sacrificer attains all his life in this world and immortality in the heavenly world.
13.4.18	These are indeed the breaths, which are the Dvidevatya-s.
13.4.19	Speech is indeed Indra.
13.5.7	The Prāṇas are indeed yoked together.
13.5.8	He places the Indra-Vāyu (bricks) in the eastern half.
13.5.9	This is the eastern half of the Prāṇas, as it were.
13.5.10	He places two (bricks) on either side in the rear.
13.5.11	The eye and the ear are indeed on either side.
13.5.12	Having taken them, he places them.
13.5.13	So that they do not become scattered.
13.5.14	He does not place them upside down.
13.5.15-20	The Pranas are the two-deity deities. "So as not to obstruct the Pranas." "The offering to Soma is sweet." He recites the Anuvshada for the sake of peace of the offerings. For the sake of the establishment of the offerings. Then they join the Hotr priests.
13.5.21	They release the sacrificer from debt.
13.5.22	The first portion is of the two-deity deities.
13.5.23	Then the Hotr's goblet.
13.5.24	The sacrificial cakes are the self of the sacrificer.
13.5.25	The two-deity offerings are the breaths.
13.5.26	The Ida is the food, the animals.
13.5.27	The breaths and the self are united by food.
13.5.28	Therefore the first portion is of two-deity deity.
13.5.29	Then the Hotr's goblet.
13.5.30	He gives them to the Adhvaryu.
13.5.31	He does not give them away, because of the pouring down of the remainder.
13.5.32	The Dvidevatyas are the vital airs.
13.5.33	"One should not give away the vital airs."
13.5.34	He eats the Indra-Vayu twice.
13.5.35	For he utters the Vasat twice.
13.5.36	He eats the Maitravaruna once.
13.5.37	He eats of the Asvins once.
13.6.7	The Soma is the semen.
13.6.8	The Soma is semen.
13.6.9	"So that he may not injure the semen with the thunderbolt."
13.6.10	He says to her while she is not pressing (the Soma).
13.6.11	He does not utter the benediction.
13.6.12	Having invoked the Ida, he smells it and drinks it.
13.6.13	He eats the Ida which is left over.
13.6.14	Then having sipped water, he eats the Hotr's portion.
13.6.15	This indeed is the supreme food, namely, the Soma.
13.6.16	All of them partake of the supreme food, having invited it.
13.6.17	Now, indeed, there is a counter-invitation to the Acchavaka.
13.6.18	"The one who is singing the hymn has invited the one who is pressing, saying, "The one who is pressing has invited the one singing the hymn."
13.6.19	"The one who is standing firm has invited the one speaking, and our cows have been invited."
13.6.20	If he does not offer counter-invitation,
13.6.21	If he offers after being invited, he should repeat "O invited one!"
13.6.22	The Acchāvāka, having been invited back, should run as many times as the verses of this hymn permit, saying, "Let us go to the song."
13.6.23	The Hotṛ should not be uncooperative with the Acchāvākin.
13.6.24	That is the atonement there.
13.7.1	The Rtuyaajas are the vital breaths.
13.7.2	Now, when they perform the rites of the seasons,
13.7.3	they place the life-force in the sacrificer.
13.7.4	This life-force is indeed divided into three parts: prāṇa, apāna, and vyāna.
13.7.5	They perform the rites of six seasons.
13.7.6	They place the prāṇa in the sacrificer
13.7.7	They perform the rite of four seasons.
13.7.8	They put the apāna in the sacrificer.
13.7.9	Twice he recites the Rtu-verse.
13.7.10	He places the Vyana-breath in the sacrificer.
13.7.11	Thus the sacrificer, having come to all his life in this world, attains immortality and the unshakable heaven.
13.7.12	These are indeed the breaths, which are the Rtu-offerings.
13.7.13	Therefore they offer without interruption for the continuity of the breaths.
13.7.14	The breaths are indeed continuous.
13.7.15	They do not recite the Anuvṣat-formula.
13.7.16	The Rtu-offerings are the vital airs.
13.7.17	The Anuvṣat is the conclusion.
13.7.18	"So that we do not place the vital airs before their time."
13.7.19	For these vital airs are indeed united.
13.7.20	They say, "Why does the Hotṛ recite 'Let the Hotṛ recite' to all?"
13.7.21	The Hotṛ is indeed speech.
13.7.22	"He says, 'May the Yakshas of speech protect, may the Yakshas protect.'
13.7.23	And indeed all these seven are Hotr-priests.
13.7.24	Or else, what is mentioned in the Rg-verse:
13.7.25	'The seven Hotr-priesthoods are worshipped by the seasons.'
13.7.26	And when he twice mentions above, it is for immortality.
13.7.27	They become twelve.
13.7.28	Twelve are the months in a year.
13.7.29-36	for the attainment of the year itself. He who would eat here, he who would say to him there, "The food is not sanctified, not consecrated with the Vasat-call." His life would depart and he would not live. So it would be. He who does not eat, he who says to him there, "Food is life."
13.7.37	The Self is more inward than the breath. One would not live.
13.7.38	One should smell as if smeared, and here in the two-deity rites.
13.7.39	There they know the instruction.
13.7.40	And when those (two) transgress,
13.7.41	The Adhvaryus do not approach each other.
13.7.42	Therefore one season does not follow another season. One season does not follow the other season.
14.1.1	Now, indeed, about the ghee.
14.1.2	The gods, indeed, won all desires and immortality by means of ghee.
14.1.3	In the same way, indeed, the sacrificer wins all desires and immortality through ghee.
14.1.4	This ghee is indeed of six kinds.
14.1.5	Silent recitation, silent praise, the Puroruk, the Sukta, the Utkhavirya, the Yajya.
14.1.6	The year is six-fold, with six seasons.
14.1.7	By means of this six-fold oblation, the gods attained the six-fold, six-seasonal year.
14.1.8	By means means of the year, all desires, all immortality.
14.1.9	In the same way, the sacrificer, by means of this sixfold ghee, attains the six seasons and the year, which is sixfold.
14.1.10	By means of the year, all desires, all immortality.
14.1.11	And when he murmurs silently before,
14.1.12	The sacrifice is indeed the heavenly world.
14.1.13	When he murmurs silently before,
14.1.14	It makes it a blessing for the attainment of the world of heaven.
14.1.15	Then he recites the silent praise in a low voice.
14.1.16	For the attainment of all desires.
14.1.17	"Agni is light, light is Agni."
14.1.18	He attains this world and the worlds.
14.1.19	The morning pressing of the sacrifice.
14.1.20	"Indra is light, light Indra."
14.2.2	It is placed at the beginning of the Sūkta at the morning pressing.
14.2.3	For then it is at the beginning.
14.2.4	In the middle of the Sūktas at the midday pressing.
14.2.5	For it is in the middle then.
14.2.6	The last ones are left over at the third pressing.
14.2.7	For he has then gone around to the end.
14.2.8	He goes with the form of this (Sūkta) and places the Niviḍa.
14.2.9	They say that Anjaya is the morning pressing.
14.2.10	The Shiti-pashta horses are the midday pressing.
14.2.11	The white-tailed horses are the third pressing. Thus with the sun.
14.2.12	He praises the Puroruchi with twelve steps.
14.2.13	Twelve months are a year.
14.2.14	For the attainment of the year.
14.2.15	Then he praises the seven-verse ghee.
14.2.16	There are seven metres.
14.2.17	For the attainment of all metres.
14.2.18	It becomes Anushtubh.
14.2.19	Speech is Anushtubh
14.2.20	Whatever is spoken by Anushtubh, one attains all that.
14.2.21	One seizes at the foot.
14.2.22	That is the form for progeny.
14.2.23	A man seizes a woman.
14.2.24	Whatever he does, he does it in the form of the two supports.
14.2.25	This is the form of the supports.
14.2.26	Now, indeed, this is the mouth of death, that is between these two feet.
14.2.27	If one were to say anything here,
14.2.28	one would fall into the mouth of death and would not live. So it would be.
14.3.1	Therefore one should move on without saying anything.
14.3.2	The breath is indeed immortality.
14.3.3	By means of the immortal, he crosses death.
14.3.4	He recites with the entire northern half of the verse.
14.3.5	He strikes the vajra at the evil, at the brother.
14.3.6	Those ten Gāyatrī verses are completed.
14.3.7	The tenth pada is indeed eight syllables.
14.3.8	That which is Anushtubh is Gāyatrī.
14.3.9	Gāyatrī is the meter of Agni.
14.3.10	The Adhvaryu takes ten cups at the morning pressing.
14.3.11	They praise with nine verses in the Bahispavamāna.
14.3.12	The tenth is the Hinkāra.
14.3.13	These are ten.
14.3.14	They make them different and then complete Viraj.
14.3.15	This is the entire food, namely Viraj.
14.3.16	Having completed it, he gives it back to the sacrificer.
14.3.17	The first three times, the last three times, making eleven.
14.3.18	The twelfth is the offering verse.
14.3.19	Twelve months are a year.
14.3.20	For the attainment of the year.
14.3.21	Those are recited, making sixteen Gāyatrī verses.
14.3.22	It becomes united with the Gāyatrī ghee.
14.3.23	He offers to Agni-Indra.
14.3.24	He makes Indra the one who shares half of the Soma pressing.
14.3.25	In that (goddess) the gods partake together. Thus indeed did Kauṣītaki say.
14.3.26	The Viraj has thirty-three syllables.
14.3.27	There are thirty-three deities.
14.3.28	He makes the deities share the syllables.
14.3.29	Having left out the verse "O Agni, O Indra, the giver of wealth, the giver of food," he enters the half-verse of Viraj.
14.3.30	Viraj is prosperity, food.
14.3.31	He establishes himself in the food of the Goddess Viraj.
14.3.32	He makes the Vasat-call with the half-verse of Viraj.
14.3.33	Thus he places the sacrificer in the heavenly world.
14.3.34	He makes an Anuvṣat-call for the peace of the oblations.
14.3.35	For the establishment of the oblations,
14.4.1	He calls out "Shonsava" at the morning pressing.
14.4.2	"Shonsamam daive" (O Shonsama, in the divine) says the Adhvaryu.
14.4.3	Those are eight syllables.
14.4.4	"Uktham avachi" (Recite the eulogy) says the Hotri in a low voice at the morning pressing.
14.4.5	"Ukthasha" (Eulogizer) says the Advaryu.
14.4.6	They are eight.
14.4.7	Having approached the pressing with the Gayatri (verse), they have settled in the Gayatri.
14.4.8	"Shonsamam adhvaryo" (O Shon sama, O Adhvaryu) says the Adhvayu at the midday pressing.
14.4.9	The Adhvaryu says, "Shonasaṃ daive."
14.4.10	They are eleven syllables.
14.4.11	At the Madhyandina Savana, the Hotṛ should say in a low voice, "Uktham avācīndraye."
14.4.12	The Adhvaryu replies, "Ukthaśā."
14.4.13	They are also eleven.
14.4.14	The Savana is completed with Tristubh verses, and the Pratiṣṭhātā stands with Tristubh.
14.4.15-21	The Adhvaryu calls out thrice at the third pressing, "O Soma, do thou press." The Adhvaryu responds, "O Soma do thou press." These are twelve syllables. With Lomasa there are thirteen. The Hotṛ says in a low voice at the third pressing: "O Indra, the eulogy for the gods." The Adhvaryu responds, "The eulogy." These are twelve.
14.4.22	Now the two worlds have come to the sacrifice, and they have taken their place in the two worlds.
14.4.23	This indeed is what is offered in the middle.
14.4.24	If he has a liking for the elaborate (chant),
14.4.25	The metres of one who knows this carry the sacrifice.
14.4.26	And this is what is said in the Rgveda.
14.4.27	What is placed in the Gāyatrī, in the Gāyatra, what is placed in the Tristubh, in the Tristubha,
14.4.28	What is placed in the Jagat, in the Jagat-verse, those who know that attain immortality."
14.4.29	And also because these deities are placed in these worlds,
14.4.30	The Gāyatrī is placed in this world, and this Agni is placed in the Gayatra.
14.4.31	In the Tristubh world of the atmosphere, the wind has ascended.
14.4.32	In the Jagat world of the sky, the sun has ascended.
14.5.1	Having chanted the Ajya, he chants the Prauga.
14.5.2	The Ajya is the self of the sacrificer.
14.5.3	The Prauga are the vital airs.
14.5.4	Therefore, having chanted the Ajya he chants the Praugam.
14.5.5	Thus indeed, the sacrificer, having come to all his life in this world, attains immortality and the imperishable world of heaven.
14.5.6	In the Pavamāna Sūkta, the Hotr recites the Ajya Sūkta.
14.5.7	In the Ajya Sûkta, the Prauga Sûkta is recited.
14.5.8	This Prauga Sûktam is indeed the Pavamāna Suktam.
14.5.9	The Ajya Sûktam itself is the Suktam of the Ajya.
14.5.10	They enjoy this.
14.5.11	Just as one would separate the reins of a chariot, so one should separate them.
14.5.12	Kauṣītaki said, "One should recite the Grahas in accordance with the Grahas."
14.5.13	The Graha of Vayu and Indra-Vayu is the one that is mentioned.
14.5.14	One should offer it with the Vayu and IndraVayu offerings.
14.5.15	The Maitrāvaruṇa Graha with the Maitrāvaruṇa offering.
14.5.16	The Asvin Graha with the Asvin offering.
14.5.17	The offering for those who have departed is made with the Indra offering.
14.5.18	What the Hotr binds together, that with the Vaishvadev.
14.5.19	Speech itself is Sarasvati in all the Savanas.
14.5.20	And indeed the Puroruk is that which shines yonder.
14.5.21	For it shines forth in front.
14.5.22	And indeed, the Puroruk, the breath itself is the self, the Suktam.
14.5.23	And indeed Puroruk is the self itself.
14.5.24	The Suktam is offspring and cattle.
14.5.25	Therefore, one does not recite the Puroruc and the Sookta in between.
14.5.26	One recites the Puroruc after the Sookta.
14.5.27	One recitess the Puroruc in the Puroruc.
14.5.28	Vayu is the leader, that is the form of Prāṇa.
14.5.29	Vāyava is the form of Apāna.
14.6.1	One recitaes the Gāyatrī Prauga.
14.6.2	By that, the morning pressing is attained.
14.6.3	One recitates the Indra.
14.6.4	By that the midday pressing is attained.
14.6.5	He recites the Vaishvadev hymn.
14.6.6	By that the third pressing is attained.
14.6.7	Then he recites the Vaishnavi Puroruchi.
14.6.8	It has six feet.
14.6.9	They say that it is the six seasons.
14.6.10	There are six seasons.
14.6.11	He recites two verses each for it, with a pause.
14.6.12	Therefore, the two seasons are mentioned as the whole of the seasons, namely, summer, rainy season, and winter.
14.6.13	Here some praise the Sarasvati Puroruk.
14.6.14	One should not do so.
14.6.15	It is excessive.
14.6.16	Speech is indeed praised.
14.6.17	Speech is itself Puroruk.
14.6.18	O Wind, come to the sight of the Asvins, the giver of gifts. These two are the Prāga and the Navarc and the Dvādaśarc.
14.6.19	That makes twenty-one.
14.6.20	The Ekavimsa is the highest of the Stomas.
14.6.21	He attains the highest Stoma.
14.6.22	And why twenty-one?
14.6.23	The twelve months, the five seasons, these three worlds,
14.6.24	That Aditya is the twenty-first.
14.6.25	By that he leads the sacrificer to the same world as his.
14.7.1	Those are indeed seven verses.
14.7.2	There are seven metres.
14.7.3	For the attainment of all metres.
14.7.4	Now, indeed, by these (verses) the gods won the seven Sapta-sapta (verses) of the Asuras.
14.7.5	In the same way the sacrificer now, by these (Sapta-sapta verses), wins the seven Sapta sapta (verses) from his hateful foe.
14.7.6	Agni's morning pressing was first.
14.7.7	Indra's midday pressing.
14.7.8	The third pressing was of all the gods.
14.7.9	Agni desired:
14.7.10	"May I be at the midday pressing and also at the third pressing."
14.7.11	Indra desired,
14.7.12	"May I be at morning pressing and also at third pressing."
14.7.13	The All-gods desired,
14.7.14	"Let us be at the midday-pressing and also at the morning-pressing."
14.7.15	From there they drew the deities from the third pressing to the morning-pressing.
14.7.16-21	That is why they are called Prāga. That is why the Prāga is called Prāga Therefore many deities are praised in the Prāga. Therefore all the Savanas are dedicated to all deities. Having praised the hymn "O Soma, with all the gods," one offers to the Vaishvadevya. Because this hymn is Vaishvadevam.
14.7.22	The morning pressing is accomplished with the Gayatri.
14.7.23	"Let us all say 'Vashat!' Let us all say ' Vashat!'"
15.1.1	The gods attained immortality by means of the Arbudas and the Pavamanis and the praise of the Gravas.
15.1.2	They attained truth, their intention.
15.1.3	In the same way, the sacrificer, when he praises the stones with the Arbudas and Pavamanis, attains immortality.
15.1.4	He attains the truth of his resolve.
15.1.5	Then, when the Pavamana has been praised, they perform with the Dadhigrahas.
15.1.6	Here the time comes.
15.1.7	And also for the abundance of the pressing.
15.1.8	Then they perform the Havishpankti (rites). The Brāhmaṇa text relating to it has been recited.
15.1.9	Bharadvaja performs the rites for those who have set out at midday.
15.1.10	Bharad vaja at midday offered Soma to Indra.
15.1.11	That (rite) becomes the Indra-related Tristubh.
15.1.14	For the establishment of oblations.
15.1.15	Then the Hotr priests perform the rites. The Brāhmaṇas relating to them have been recited.
15.1.16	Then the Hotr's goblet is taken up. Its Brāhmaṇa has been recited.
15.1.17	When the oblations have been offered, the Dakṣiṇās are led away.
15.1.20	For by means of the Dakṣiņās, indeed, one makes the sacrifice prosper.
15.1.21	And because one makes the sacrifice to prosper by means of the dakṣiṇās,
15.1.22	therefore they are called dakṣiṇā.
15.1.23	The Sattra is the self-dakṣiṇā,
15.1.24	therefore they should recite it everyday.
15.1.26	This I give to Kālī, to Kīrti, to heaven, to the world of heaven, to immortality.
15.1.27	Having recited the Puronuvākyā for the Vaisvānara Graha belonging to the Maruts, one offers to Vaisvānāra.
15.1.28	The Marutvatīya Graha is the continuity of the Soma pressing.
15.1.29	Vaisvānara is speech.
15.1.30	The sacrifice is sustained by speech.
15.1.31	Those two are in the Tristubh metre belonging to Indra.
15.2.4	He recites the six metres, namely, Anushtubh, Gayatri, Brihat, Ushnih, Tristubh and Jagati.
15.2.5	Therefore it becomes sixfold.
15.2.6	The Marutvatiya (verse) is recited in Anushtubh metre with the words, "O Raths, do ye come to us."
15.2.7	The Marutvatlya is indeed the praise of Pavamana.
15.2.8	Anushtubh is the metre of Soma.
15.2.9	The Brāhmaṇa on the analysis of the verse has been stated.
15.2.10	He recites the Gāyatrī verses.
15.2.11	The Gāyatrī is indeed the vital breath.
15.2.12	He thus places the vital breath in himself.
15.2.13	"This is the Soma that has been pressed, O Vasu, O Andha." The follower is the one who has drunk and tasted.
15.2.14	This is indeed the praise of Pavamāna.
15.2.15	"O Indra, come here now." The invocation to Indra is a Prāgātha.
15.2.16	The Maruts said to him, "Do not go away."
15.2.17	He said, "After killing Vritra and conquering, you should drink Soma with me."
15.2.18	They drank Soma with him.
15.2.19	"Now indeed, O Brahmanaspati," is a Pragaṭha for Brahmanaspati.
15.2.20	Brahma said to him, “Strike!” while harassing him.
15.2.21	He said, "Having slain Vritra, you have won this Soma-drink for me."
15.2.22	This is indeed the Soma-drink of Brahman.
15.2.23	In this (Soma-drink) the deities share," so says Kauṣītaki.
15.2.24	In which Indra, Varuna, Mitra, Aryaman, the gods have made their places.
15.2.25	Here the deities have shared.
15.3.1	They say, "Why are the two verses of Indra-nihav and Brahmaspati, which are not in the Stotriya and Anurupya, sung again?"
15.3.2	The Sama-singers sing the Purara-daaya in the Pavamana.
15.3.3	This is its form.
15.3.4	Agni is the leader, like Bhaga among the earthly ones. You, O Soma, are the good-willed one with the seasons. This is in the Agni-Soma (Sutra).
15.3.5	Agni and Soma were within Vritra.
15.3.6	Indra was not able to strike the thunderbolt against them.
15.3.7	They approached this share of them.
15.3.8	And that which is their full moon.
15.3.9	This is the hymn that Indra used to slay Vritra.
15.3.10	For by this hymn Indra slew Vritra. "
15.3.11	"The Maruts, the givers of good gifts, swell the waters." They swell the waters.
15.3.12	The waters swell the waters. "
15.3.13	When Vritra was slain, the waters flowed.
15.3.14	They swelled, and therefore they are called "swellers of waters."
15.3.15	That is the Jagati.
15.3.16	By it all the Savanas become Jagat-possessed.
15.3.17	"The born, the fierce, the strong, the fourth" - this is the Marutvatya (verse).
15.3.18	This is where Indra is born, when he slew Vritra.
15.3.19	This is where he is born, who performs sacrifice.
15.3.20	On the first of these, the Adhvaryu recites the Madhuvat verse once, and then returns.
15.4.8	He recites each of their individual verses.
15.4.9	He places each of those breaths in himself.
15.4.10	He goes with the highest breath.
15.4.11	He releases this very breath.
15.4.12	For this breath, all the other breaths follow.
15.4.13	And they also say, "Food is the nest."
15.4.14	Therefore one should recite them in order.
15.4.15	For he eats the food of one who is not in a hurry.
15.4.16	Having praised the eulogy, "O Maghavan, you have grown by killing Ahi," he offers.
15.4.17	"Those who are in Sambara, those who are in Hariva, those who are at Gavishta."
15.4.18	By these he performed these deeds of strength.
15.4.19	By them alone he drinks Soma.
15.4.20	That is the Indra-related Tristubh.
15.4.21-26	The midday pressing is indeed Indra's, in Trishtup metre. He makes the Anuvshada offering for the sake of peace of the offerings. For the sake of the establishment of the offerings. The first Anushtup is indeed speech. Five Gāyatrī verses follow it. The mind is Indra-nihav, the ear is Brahmanaspatya,
15.4.27	Prāṇa, Apāna, Vyāna, these are the three that have one path.
15.4.28	The Self is the Sūkta, and the Antaratman is the Nivit.
15.4.29	The Pratiṣṭhā is the Paridhāniya, and the Annam is the Yajyā.
15.5.1	Now the Nishkevalya.
15.5.2	Many deities are praised in the east, and many are above.
15.5.3	Now this is the Nishkevalyam of Indra alone.
15.5.4	That is the reason for the name of the Nishkevalya.
15.5.5	Now, what is found in the Brihatī (verse)
15.5.6	He who shines is indeed the Brihat.
15.5.7	It makes him prosper in his own form.
15.5.8	He makes two or three (bricks) again and again.
15.5.9	That is the form of progeny.
15.5.10	Two are indeed the first (bricks),
15.5.11	From which progeny arises.
15.5.14	One should make a counterpart or a replica.
15.5.15	He is born in his progeny as a suitable one, not as an unsuitable one.
15.5.16	He recites the Dhayyā verse.
15.5.17	The Dhayyā verse is indeed the vital breath.
15.5.18	He thus places the vital breath in himself.
15.5.19	He recits the Pragātha verse.
15.5.20	The Pragātha verse is indeed cattle.
15.5.21	It is for the attainment of cattle.
15.5.22	And the Pragātha is the vital breath and out-breath of the Barhaspatya.
15.5.23	He thus puts the vital breath and the out-breath in himself.
15.5.24-30	I shall proclaim the heroic deeds of Indra. This is the fifteen-versed hymn of the Nishkevalya. The thunderbolt is fifteen-versed. By means of the thunderbolt, he destroys the sin of the sacrificer. In the middle of it, he places the Nivida. In the midst of the body, food is placed. Then he recites the Nivida. The Nivida is the vital airs.
15.5.31	He thus places the vital airs in himself.
15.5.32	He praises each of them with a single foot, with a single syllable.
15.5.33	He thus places each of them in himself.
15.5.34	With the last one he goes forth.
15.5.35	He thus gives up this very vital air.
15.5.36	For this vital air all the other vital airs follow.
15.5.37	And they also say, "Food is the nest."
15.5.38	Therefore one should recite them slowly.
15.5.39	For one eats food as if not in a hurry, and in accordance with one's desire.
15.6.1	One should recite the Paridhananiya verses.
15.6.2	For then the wife does not become estranged.
15.6.3	One should do it more often.
15.6.4	For then his wife becomes like one with a calm mind.
15.6.5	The Stotriya is the self, the Anurupas are the offspring.
15.6.6	The Mahishī is the Dhāyyā, the Prastāra is the animals.
15.6.7	The Ātman is the Sūkta, the Antarātman is the Nivit.
15.6.8	The Pratiṣṭhā is the Paridhānyā, the Annam is the Yājyā.
15.6.9	When the Pavamāna was being praised, the Hotr was attacked by Death.
15.6.10	He was removed with clarified butter from the Stotriya.
15.6.11	In the first Sama, the Hotr, was attacked.
15.6.12	He removed it with the Prāuga (Sāman) from the Stotriya.
15.6.13	It was brought back in the Madhyandina Pavamāna.
15.6.14	He removed it with the Marutvatīya (Sāman), again from the Stotriyas.
15.6.15	Then indeed one attains the Nishkevalya (Sāma) with the Stotriya (Sāmans).
15.6.16	Just as one who has escaped from danger, just as one who has overcome death.
15.6.17	They say that this is the only one, the only one, at the great sacrifice. The verses are sung in the other world with four extra verses. How do they come here?
15.6.18	They come here more often.
15.6.19	The Stotriya and Anurūpa are sung together. They amount to seven with four extra verses
15.6.20	And a verse of four syllables comes up.
15.6.19	The Stotriya and Anurūpa are sung together. They amount to seven plus four.
15.6.20	A verse of four syllables is recited.
15.6.21	Those are the animals.
15.6.22	He places those animals in the sacrificer.
15.6.23	The Agniṣṭoma is indeed Viraj.
15.6.24	The Stotriyas amount to ninety-one.
15.6.25	When one performs the Viraj sacrifice, one directly attains the form of the Agniṣṭoma.
15.6.26	Drink Soma, O Indra, may it delight thee. The verse of Viraj, with the last line omitted, is recited.
15.6.27	Viraj is prosperity, food.
15.6.28	He stands firm in prosperity and food.
15.6.29	He offers the Vasat-call with the northern half of the verse of Viraj.
15.6.30	He places the sacrificer in heaven.
15.6.31	He pronounces the Anuvṣat-formula for the sake of the peace of the offerings.
15.6.32	For the sake of the establishment of the offerings. For the sake of the establishmentof the offerings.
16.1.1	The morning pressing belongs to the Vasus.
16.1.2	The midday pressing belongs to the Rudras.
16.1.3	The third pressing belongs to the Adityas.
16.1.4	When he proceeds with the Adityagraha to the third pressing,
16.1.5	he proceeds with his own deity.
16.1.6	Now the third pressing is indeed the juice of the Soma.
16.1.7	And that is the Soma-pressing, namely the Aditya-graha.
16.1.8	By that very (graha) he makes the third pressing the juice.
16.1.9	Having recited the Puronuvākyā in Tristubh metre for the Aditya-grahas, he offers in Tristubh.
16.1.10	The Tristubh is strength and vigour.
16.1.11	He thus places strength and vigour in the sacrificer.
16.1.12	He does not recite the Anuvṣaṭ-formula.
16.1.13	The Graha of Aditya is the continuity of the pressing; the Anuvṣṭa-formula is the cessation.
16.1.14	"So that the pressing may not be brought to a close before time."
16.1.15	The Yajus is connected with Madhu; the third pressing is connected with Madhvi.
16.1.16	Then they perform the Pavamāna-stotra and the animal sacrifice. The Brāhmaṇa in this connection is stated.
16.1.17	Then they proceed with the Havishpaṅkti. The Brāhmṇa in this connection has been stated.
16.2.1-6	The Arbhava-Indra is the third pressing. The Arbhava Indra is the third pressing, to be recited when the Soma is being pressed. For it was at that place that the Rishis attained the measure of Prajapati. Indra then joined them in the drinking of Soma. Therefore one should not praise the Arbhava. Now they call the Pavamana as Arbhava. The Arbava-Indra is to be recited when Soma is being pressed for the third pressing.
16.2.7-12	He makes Indra the receiver of half of the Soma-pressing. With the Jagati metre, for the Jagati metre is the third pressing. With the Madvatī metre, for the Madvatī is the third pressing.
16.2.13	Then the Hotr's goblet. Its Brāhmaṇa is known.
16.2.14	They perform the Upavasana rites at the third pressing.
16.2.15	They thus gratify the Pitrs.
16.2.16	Then they perform with the Savitrī verse.
16.2.17	In the morning pressing he first performed this (sacrifice).
16.2.18	His progeny did not increase.
16.2.19	He performed it at the midday pressing.
16.2.20	There it did not increase.
16.2.21	They worshipped him at the third pressing.
16.2.22	From that the creatures were born.
16.2.23	Therefore Savitr is fixed at the third pressing,
16.2.24	Or Savitr is one of the Adityas.
16.2.25	The third pressing is of the Adityan.
16.2.26	Therefore they worship him at the third press- ing.
16.2.27	Having recited the Tristubh Savitr-graha's Puronuvakya, he offers with the Jagati.
16.2.28	The Tristubh metre is strength and valour.
16.2.29	The Jagati metre is cattle.
16.2.30	He thus establishes strength and valour at the end in cattle.
16.2.31	He does not offer the Anuvshada-call.
16.2.32	The Savitra Graha is the breath, the Anuvshadakara is the stability.
16.2.33	"One should not establish the breath before time."
16.2.34	For this breath is like a yoke.
16.3.6	The Anushtubh is the metre of Soma.
16.3.7	The Brahmana on the analysis of the words has been stated.
16.3.8	He recites the Gāyatrī verses.
16.3.9	The Gāyatrī is indeed the vital breath.
16.3.10	He thus places the vital breath in himself.
16.3.11	He recitess the Savitrī verse.
16.3.12	For the Savitrī is indeed the Graha that is taken up.
16.3.13	He thus recites it in accordance with that.
16.3.14	He recits the Vāyavya verse.
16.3.15	The Vāyavyan is indeed the vital prāṇa.
16.3.16	He places the breath in himself.
16.3.17	They release the two-deity verses in that (verse).
16.3.18	In Vayu, in the breath, the breaths.
16.3.19	He recites the Dyava-Prithivi verse.
16.3.20	The heaven and earth are indeed the foundation; through the foundation.
16.3.21	The Adhvaryu recites in response to it in a cheerful manner.
16.3.22	The third pressing is cheerful.
16.3.23	He recits the Surupa-Kritnu verse.
16.3.24	Food is indeed beautiful.
16.3.25	He indeed places food in himself.
16.3.26	And this is indeed the Soma-drink of beauty.
16.3.27	He indeed puts beauty in himself.
16.3.28	He recites the Arbhava hymn.
16.3.29	For here Prajapati assigned them.
16.3.30	Therefore it is recited here.
16.3.31	Then he recites the hymn to Aditi and Brhaspati.
16.3.32	The two verses beginning with "Sukra" and "Amant" are the only ones that are recited in the Anusavana.
16.3.33	Then the verses of the Visvadevya.
16.3.34	One recites the Visvadevy verses for the sake of not omitting the deities.
16.3.35	For the Visvadev graha is taken up.
16.3.36	One recitess it in the Anusavan.
16.3.37	He recites the Paridhananiya twice at the end.
16.3.38	The third one in half-verses.
16.3.39	She unites with Viraj.
16.3.40	Sri is Viraj, the food.
16.3.41	Sri is the attainment of Viraj, the nourishment.
16.4.1	He recites four verses in the Visvedeva (hymn).
16.4.2	The Visvedeva is indeed cattle.
16.4.3	Cattle are fourfold.
16.4.4	And cattle have four feet. For the attainment of cattle.
16.4.5	Therefore one should recite it at ease.
16.4.6	The animals delight in this.
16.4.7	One recites the Vaishvadevya hymn of sixteen days.
16.4.8	This entire universe is sixteen-fold.
16.4.9	For the attainment of this entire universe.
16.4.10	It becomes seventeen-fold.
16.4.11	There are eleven deities, four Nividas, Ukthaviryas, and the Yagya.
16.4.12	Prajapati is seventeen-fold.
16.4.13	This is the most worthy rite, which is equal to Prajapati.
16.4.14	Having praised the hymn "May all the gods listen to this invocation of mine," one offers sacrifice to the All-gods.
16.4.15	For this hymn is indeed for the All-gods
16.4.16	The Tristubh metre is strength and valour.
16.4.17	He thus places strength and valour in the sacrificer.
16.4.18-25	My own, like my own, is the third pressing. He recites the Anuvshada-verse for the sake of the peace of the offerings. For the establishment of the offerings. The first Anushtubh verse is indeed speech. Five Gayatri verses follow it. The Savitri verse is the mind. The Vayuya verse is the breath. The Dyavaprithivyaya verse is the eyes.
16.4.26	This is the unmentioned Prāṇa, the creator of good form.
16.4.27	The ear is the Ārbhava.
16.4.28	Prāṇa, Apāna, Vyāna, these are the three that have one path.
16.4.29	The self is the Sūkta, the inner self is the Nivit.
16.4.30	The Pratiṣṭhā is the Paridhāniya, the Anna is the Yajyā.
16.5.1	They say, why are the Brāhma and Kṣatriya alone mentioned as the two classes that are not to be moved?
16.5.2-8	The morning pressing is Brahman. The midday pressing is the Kshatriya. The third pressing is the Vis. Therefore, the Brahmanas, when they have not fixed (the time), perish. The Kshatriyas perish when they have not settled (the time). And when the Paridhaniya of the third pressing is omitted,
16.5.9	Therefore, the Vid is called "unfailing."
16.5.10	He says, "Sacrifice the ghee, sacrifice the Soma."
16.5.11	Indeed, the sacrifice is supported by these two, by ghee and Soma.
16.5.12	He pleases them here.
16.5.13	"When pleased, they will carry the sacrifice," he says.
16.5.14	He sacrifices the ghee in a low voice.
16.5.15	Ghee is the seed-impregnation.
16.5.16	Seed is impregnated in a low voice.
16.5.17-24	Now, why does one offer the Soma of the Uccaiḥ Sāman? Soma is the moon. The moon is the one who is described. They say that one should not offer beyond it. So that those who are here may see those who are there. But it is indeed established that one should offer beyond it. The clarified butter is the world of the gods. The Soma is the world of fathers.
16.5.25	They go to the world of the gods from the world of the fathers.
16.5.26	And they indeed please the fathers when they behave in a gentle manner.
16.5.27	And they say that one should abandon the Upasads.
16.5.28	One offers to Agni, Soma and Vishnu in the Upasads,
16.5.29	One offers to Agnis, Soma and Vishnu here.
16.5.30	They carry this auspicious seat.
16.5.31	The Hotṛ priest receives it and places it down.
16.5.32	Then, having examined himself with ghee, he touches the ghee with his fingers,
16.5.33	saying, "You are the protector of the eyes. Protect my eyes." He rubs his eyes.
16.5.34	He thus protects his eyes.
16.5.35	Then he gives it to the Udgātṛs,
16.6.1-8	Then they perform with the Patnīvat graha. They make the wives the recipients of the Ahavaniya. He does not recite the Anuvṣṭakāra. Because it is mixed with ghee. Ghee is not a share for the Anuvṣṣṭakāra He offers silently. The Patnīvat grahas are the impregnation of semen. One impregnates silently.
16.6.9-14	The Patnīvat-graha is the besprinkling of semen. The Sthānu-svarā is the Vasat-utterance. "One should not besprinkle the semen before the time." They say, "If this is the Yajya of the Hotṛ, then why does the Agnīdhra offer it with this?" This Yajya is indeed Agni's. The Agnīdhra is Agni's. Therefore the Agnīdhara offers it with this.
16.6.15	Now, indeed, the Anukthas are the Vasat-calls.
16.7.1	He recites the Airavata hymn with twenty-one verses.
16.7.2	The twenty-one is the highest of the Stomas, the one to be attained.
16.7.3	It is indeed for the attainment of the highest.
16.7.4	It becomes twenty-fourfold.
16.7.5	There are twenty joints.
16.7.6	They are forty-four.
16.7.7	The Tristup metre has forty-four syllables.
16.7.8	The Tristup is strength, is valour.
16.7.9	He thus places strength, valour in the sacrificer.
16.7.10	He recites the Vaishvanara hymn.
16.7.11	For the Vaishvanar graha is taken.
16.7.12	He thus recites it in accordance with that.
16.7.13	He recits the Rudra hymn.
16.7.14	Rudra is terrible.
16.7.15	He thus makes it a remedy.
16.7.16	Now this is the last part of it.
16.7.17	Therefore he recites it in the last (part of the sacrifice).
16.7.18	He recites the Marut-stotra.
16.7.19	This is the group of Rudra.
16.7.20	He thus makes him prosper with his own group.
16.7.23	Then the Stotriya and Anurupya of the Yagyayajniya.
16.7.24	He recites this (stotra) of Jātavedas.
16.7.25	Therefore it is called Agni-Marut.
16.7.26	Therefore one should recite it at the beginning.
16.7.27	Just as one would release a fire that is about to be extinguished, so should one do this.
16.8.1	One recites the Apas, the deities of water.
16.8.2	Water is indeed the remedy for peace.
16.8.3	This peace and remedy is performed at the end of the sacrifice.
16.8.4	Therefore one should recite it after the sacrifice.
16.8.5	Just as when one is about to sink in water, so should one recite this.
16.8.6	One should recite the hymn to the serpent Budhnya.
16.8.7	Agni is the serpent, the subduer.
16.8.8	He kindles him with this (verse).
16.8.9	And he praises the Dhishnyas with this (verse),
16.8.10	and the wives of the gods and Raka.
16.8.11	He praises with these (verses) the Patnivat-graha.
16.8.12	And the wives are the last sharers.
16.8.13	Therefore he praises them in the last Sastra.
16.8.14	The verses of the Aksara-s are recited.
16.8.15	The verses of the Aksaras are indeed the cattle.
16.8.16	For the attainment of cattle.
16.8.17	Or the verses of the Aksar-s are indeed the Prāṇa and Apāna.
16.8.18	He indeed places the Prāṇa-Apāna in himself.
16.8.19	Or for the supremacy of the weapon.
16.8.20	He recites the verses of the Pitrs and the Yamas.
16.8.21	He recitess these verses in accordance with the Nārāśaṃsa-s.
16.8.22	Then the Fathers are the last to receive their share.
16.8.23	Therefore he recites them in the last rite.
16.8.24	He recites the 'Sweet-kilas'.
16.8.25	He makes Indra sweet with these.
16.8.26	Or Indra is the world of the gods,
16.8.27	Yama is the world of Fathers.
16.8.28	They thus ascend the world of gods from the world of Fathers.
16.8.29	In them the Adhvaryu recites in the manner of Madhu.
16.8.30	The third pressing is in the manner of madhu.
16.8.31	He recites the Vaisnavavaruṇa hymn.
16.8.32	The sacrifice is Vaisnavavāruṇa.
16.8.33	Whatever is defective or excessive in the sacrifice,
16.8.34	it is cured by this (hymn).
16.8.35	This (hymn) indeed is a cure.
16.8.36	He recitess the Vaisnavin and Agnin hymns.
16.8.37	Agni and Vishnu are the last-sharers of the gods.
16.8.38	Therefore he recites the last hymn in the Agni-Vishnu Sastra.
16.8.39	He places it with the Indra-verse.
16.8.40	For this belongs to Indra.
16.8.41	Indra himself establishes him at the end.
16.9.1	"Who is the deity of Soma?" asked Madhuka Gau-shravas.
16.9.2	"Soma is flowing," he replied, following him.
16.9.3	"Others may be his," he replied.
16.9.4-11	As in the case of the Bahvṛca. But the position of Pingya is that it is Indra. The position of Kauṣītaki is that it is both Indra and Agni. One attains Agni by means of ghee. One concludes with Indra. This is the concluding verse. Therefore it is Indra and Agni. This is the Agniṣṭoma. This is the one that is brought for the sake of desire.
16.9.12	He who performs any other sacrifice without having performed this one,
16.9.13	is defeated and is not honoured. So said (the teacher).
16.9.14	This Agniṣṭoma is from the offering of clarified butter to the Agni-Maruts.
16.9.15	The number of verses in it is three hundred and sixty.
16.9.16	There are three hundred and sixty days in a year.
16.9.17	He obtains the days of the year.
16.9.18	Having chanted the eulogy with the verse, "O Agni, with the Maruts, the auspicious, the Rg-singers," he offers with the Agni-Marutya (verse).
16.9.19	This is the eulogy for the coming Maruts.
16.9.20	With the Jagati (verse), for the Jagati is the third pressing.
16.9.21	With the Madvatī (verse), for indeed the third pressing is Madvatī.
16.10.5	The Agniya verses are recited for the Maitrāvaruṇa, the Indraya verses for the other two.
16.10.6	Thus they become Indra-Agni verses.
16.10.7	They recite four verses each.
16.10.8	The Uktha verses are animals.
16.10.9	Animals are in groups of four.
16.10.10	And animals have four feet. For the attainment of animals.
16.10.11	They amount to twelve.
16.10.12	The twelve months are the year.
16.10.13	For the attainment of the year.
16.10.14	The weapons are four days.
16.10.15	The praises are animals.
16.10.16	Animals are fourfold.
16.10.17	And they have four feet. For the attainment of animals.
16.10.18	The Utkhayas are for two deities.
16.10.19	The sacrificer has two feet.
16.10.20	For stability.
16.10.21	They become four.
16.10.22	The Ukthas are the animals.
16.10.23	Animals are of four kinds.
16.10.24	And animals have four feet. For the attainment of animals.
16.10.25	The Maitrāvaruṇa's is Indra-Varuna.
16.10.26	For his Uktha is Indra-Varuṇa.
16.10.27	The Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin's is Indra and Brhaspati.
16.10.30	For his uktha is Indra and Viṣṇu.
16.10.31	The first and the last are the Madhu-parivatsas.
16.10.32	The third pressing is like me.
16.10.33	They are in the Tristubh metre.
16.10.34	The Tristubh metre is strength, is power.
16.10.35	They thus bestow strength and power on the sacrificer.
16.10.36	They perform the Anuvshada rite. For the peace of the offerings.
16.10.37	For the establishment of the offerings. For the establishment of the offers.
17.1.1	The sixteenfold verse is the thunderbolt in the Anushtubh metre.
17.1.2	Now, when they perform the Sodashin (rite),
17.1.3	they strike down the sacrificer's sin with the thunderbolt of the Anushtubh.
17.1.4	He becomes a Hariva.
17.1.5	Hariva means life.
17.1.6	It takes away (harati),
17.1.7	hence he becomes a Hariva (one who takes away).
17.1.8	That is the Sodashin, which shines there.
17.1.9	He pleases him.
17.1.10	Now this is the sixteenth Stotra and the sixteenth Sastra.
17.1.11	Therefore it is called 'the sixteenth'.
17.1.12	When they perform the Sodasin,
17.1.13	this whole (universe) consists of sixteen parts.
17.1.14	For the attainment of this whole (universe).
17.1.15	And Indra is the Sodasin.
17.1.16	Therefore one becomes a possessor of horses.
17.1.17	For Indra is the hymn of horses.
17.1.18	O Indra, enjoy, do thou bring, do thou come, O hero, with the bay steeds.
17.1.19	They are twenty-five syllables.
17.1.20	Each is connected with nine syllables.
17.1.21	The Self is twenty-five.
17.1.22	The offspring and cattle are the connection.
17.1.23	He thus connects himself with offspring, cattle, and food.
17.1.24	And they become thirty-four syllables.
17.1.25	This is the metre of Svarāḍ.
17.1.26	Whatever is thirty-four syllables, one attains sovereignty by this.
17.1.27	When they are combined, they become five Anushtubh verses.
17.1.28	And a verse of ten syllables rises.
17.1.29	Two for each one.
17.2.1	He praises the Gāyatrī with the words 'Tavaḥ, Purūvasa'.
17.2.2-7	These very syllables are in abundance. And with this, the Stotriya and the six Anushtubh verses are in abundance. Therefore, one recites this for abundance. Some perform the Anurupa in this way. They say, "That is the sixteenfold, that which shines. There is no other Anurupa than this.
17.2.8	He who would say to him, "Do what is appropriate here."
17.2.11	Now, indeed, he wanders in the metres above.
17.2.12	The metres are the vital airs.
17.2.13	He thus places the vital airs in himself for non-injury.
17.2.14	For these vital airs are indeed uneven, not even, and do not cease.
17.2.15	And the Anushtubh is the Sodasi.
17.2.16-22	All these metres lead to the Anushtubh. He moves between the Gāyatrī and Paṅkti metres. The Paṅkti metre is the metre of the sacrificer. The Gāyatrī metre is splendour and Brahmanic lustre. He thus places splendour and Brahmanic luster in the sacrificer. He moves between the Uṣṇīk and Bṛhatī metres. The Uṣṇīka metre is the metre for the sacrificer.
17.2.23	The animals are the Brihatī.
17.2.24	He thus places animals on the sacrificer.
17.2.25	He moves between the two-footed and the twenty-syllabled Tristubh.
17.2.26	The sacrificer's metre is the two-footed.
17.2.27	The Tristubh is strength and valour.
17.2.28	He thus puts strength and valour on the sacrificer
17.2.29	He moves between two-footed and sixteen-syllabled Jagatīs.
17.2.30	The two-footed ones are indeed the Yajamana's desire.
17.2.31	The animals are the Jagati.
17.2.32	He thus places the animals in the Yajamans.
17.3.1	He recites the Gāyatrī verses.
17.3.2	The Gāyatrī is indeed the breath.
17.3.3	He thus puts the breath in himself.
17.3.4	He recits seven verses.
17.3.5	There are seven metres.
17.3.6	For the attainment of all metres.
17.3.7	Now, when this (verse) is joined with the four Anushtubh verses, it becomes the Gayatri.
17.3.8	Therefore he recites it for prosperity.
17.3.9	Then he recites the regular Anushtubh (verses).
17.3.10	The Anushtubh is the sixteenth (verse).
17.3.11	He thus makes it prosper with its own metre.
17.3.12	They are eight in number.
17.3.13	By these the gods attained all the eight (worlds).
17.3.14	In the same way, the sacrificer attains all the eight directions by means of these (verses).
17.3.15	The ten directions are completed by the three verses of the Pari-dhāniya.
17.3.16	The Viraj has ten directions.
17.3.17	The Viraja is prosperity, food.
17.3.18	For the attainment of prosperity, Viraja, and food.
17.3.19	He places (the pot) with the verse, "The height of the rising sun."
17.3.20	The place where that (sun) shines is indeed the highest place of the heaven.
17.3.23	He places the sacrificer there itself.
17.3.24	He indeed strikes the sacrificer's sin with the thunderbolt, which is indeed three-fold.
17.3.25	These are the verses of the Uktha hymns: "The praises, the deeds."
17.3.26	One who knows this becomes one who recites verses, one who praises, one who is heroic, and one who is famous.
17.3.27	They are forty Anushtubh verses.
17.3.28	The Pankti has forty syllables.
17.3.29	The Pankhti is indeed prosperity.
17.3.30	It establishes the sacrificer in all the elements.
17.3.31	Some say, one should sacrifice with the Triṣṭubh verse that has been extended.
17.4.3	He offers the oblation to the gods with the vessel which has been duly prepared.
17.4.4	He should not go to sleep at night.
17.4.5	Indra is the sixteenth.
17.4.6	There is nothing superior to Indra.
17.4.7	He invites for many nights.
17.4.8	The Aśvina is like a succession.
17.4.9	He should go to him on the fourth day.
17.4.10	That is the abode of the sixteenth.
17.4.11-17	That day ends with the Sodashin. They say one should go on with it. The Sodashin is the complete day and night. When they perform the Sodashin, it is for the completion of the day and night. And when they perform the Atiratra, the year is as large as the day and night.
17.5.3	Darkness, sin, night.
17.5.4	By that light they cross over darkness and sin.
17.5.5	Again, they praise.
17.5.6	Thus the Saman-singers praise.
17.5.7	As praised and praised, it becomes.
17.5.8	They say, "Why do they praise the Sastra after calling from the highest gatekeeper?"
17.5.9	Man is the sacrifice.
17.5.10	His fire-altar is his head, the Havirdhana is his mouth, the Ahavaniya is his face, the Sadas is his belly, the praises are his food.
17.5.11	The arms are the Marjalyas and the Agnidhra.
17.5.12	The gods within are the Dhishnyas within the Sadas.
17.5.13	The Garhapatya and the Vrata-sharpanas are the foundation.
17.5.14	Now the other.
17.5.15	His mind is indeed Brahman, his breath is the Udgātṛ, his out-breath is the Prastôtṛ, his through-breath is the Pratihartṛ, his speech is the Hotṛ, his eye is the Adhvaryu, his progeny is the Sadasya, his self is the Yajamāna.
17.5.16	The limbs are the Hotrâśansins.
17.5.16	When the Adhvaryus performs the Stotra,
17.5.18	he unites the eye with the breaths.
17.5.19	Then when the Prastotar recites the Brahmanical formula, "We shall recite the Brahmanical hymn,"
17.5.20	the mind is the leader of these vital airs.
17.5.21	"I shall recite the Stoma with the mind,"
17.5.22	and then he connects the out-breath with the mind.
17.6.1	Then when the Brahmanical formula is recited,
17.6.2	he connects the mind with the vital airs.
17.6.3	Now when the Prastotar recites,
17.6.4	he unites the Apana with the Pranas.
17.6.5	When the Pratihartar responds,
17.6.6	he unites Vyan with the Pranas
17.6.7	When the Udgatar sings,
17.6.8	he places the Pranas in the Vyan.
17.6.9	All these deities are established in the Pranas alone.
17.6.10	Now when the Hotṛ continues the Sastra with a Sāman,
17.6.11	the Hotṛ is indeed speech,
17.6.12	he thus unites speech with the Prāṇas.
17.6.13	And when the Hotrāśansins perform the Sāman-continuation,
17.6.14	he thus joins the limbs with the Prānas.
17.6.15	And when a sacrificer approaches the Sūtra,
17.6.16	the Udgātṛs are indeed the Prāṇās,
17.6.17	He thus places the vital airs in himself.
17.6.18	Therefore one should not go outside of it, having learned it.
17.6.19	One should not go beyond it, nor should one make it heard.
17.6.20	They do not begin the praise.
17.6.21	One should neither heat oneself nor be heated.
17.6.22	One should place oneself in the vital airs."
17.6.23	Now when they recite the first verses in the first verses, 
17.6.24	From the first night itself they destroy the Asuras.
17.6.25	Then, when they chant in the middle of the cycles and in the middle of verses,
17.6.26	they destroy the Asuras from the middle of the night.
17.6.27	Then, if they chant in the last of the cycles and verses,
17.6.28	they then destroy the Asuras at the end of the night.
17.6.29	Just as one who dances in the house again and again destroys sin,
17.6.30	so do they destroy the Asuras with the Stotriya and Anurūpa verses in the day and night.
17.6.31	As it is praised, so it is praised.
17.7.1	They recite the Gāyatrī verses with the Upavasatha verses.
17.7.2	The Gāyatrī is the brilliance and the Brahmic lustre.
17.7.3	That very radiance they bestow on the sacrificer.
17.7.4	Having chanted the Gāyatrī verses, they chant the Jagatī verses.
17.7.5	They chant the Gāyatrīs and Jagatīs alternately.
17.7.6	They make the metres different in power.
17.7.7	Having chanted Jagatīs, they conclude with Tristubhs.
17.7.8	The Tristubh is strength, power.
17.7.9	The Jagatī is cattle.
17.7.10	The strength itself is the valour, and even among animals it is established.
17.7.11	The Anashvasatyas, Madvatyas, and Pitavatyas are the Yagyas in Tristubh metre, prosperous and having three characteristics.
17.7.12	This is indeed the form of the night.
17.7.13	They kept awake during the night.
17.7.14	Light is wakefulness.
17.7.15	Darkness is sin, and the night is sin.
17.7.16	By that light they cross over the darkness and sin.
17.7.17	As long as he is not praised or praised,
17.7.18	as long as he is powerful and the demons and Rakshasas do not attack him,
17.7.19	they should say, "Ignite the Ahavaniya, the Agnidhra, and the Garhapatya, and the Dhishnya fires."
17.7.20	They should ignite them, so that there is light.
17.7.21	They should lie down with their heads towards the east.
17.7.22	They say of them, "They are indeed doing well."
17.7.23	Sin does not prevail.
17.7.24	They destroy sin. They destroy sin.
18.1.1	The Asvins are indeed the excess Soma.
18.1.2	What is in excess at a sacrifice
18.1.3	is the enemy of the sacrificer.
18.1.4	And when one offers the Asvins after that,
18.1.5	The Asvins are the physicians of the gods.
18.1.6	He indeed performs the healing.
18.1.7	Then when Savitar gave the sun to Soma, the king,
18.1.8	or to Prajapati,
18.1.9	he followed it with a thousand (cows) to the daughter being milked.
18.1.10	That was the deity of these (cows).
18.1.11	They said, "Let us go to the race, for a thousand."
18.1.12	They went to the race.
18.1.13	The Asvins won it with a donkey.
18.1.14	Therefore many deities are praised.
18.1.15	Then it is called "Asvin."
18.1.16	Then indeed this is said: "The donkey does not run with all speed."
18.1.17	One who thinks that his son is dead should praise a thousand.
18.1.18	They conquered a thousand.
18.1.19	They say, "Why are the verses of the Brihatī metre, and then why does it end with the Triṣṭubh?"
18.1.20	This is the threefold praise, and three Brihatīs and one Gāyatrī are accomplished.
18.1.21	This is indeed the form of the union, that three Brihatīs.
18.1.22	The first form is the Gāyatrī.
18.1.23	Now, when he composes the Brihatī (verse),
18.1.24	for the Brihatī is composed of the Abhivrata (verses).
18.1.25	Now, when he recites the Kakup-verse, taking up the first of the Barhaspatya verses and the first of the Prathas,
18.1.26	the Sāman-singers sing taking up again.
18.1.27	This is the form of that (verse).
18.2.1	He recites the Agnēya Kratu.
18.2.2	He attains this world.
18.2.3	He recites the Ushas hymn.
18.2.4	He attains the world of the atmosphere.
18.2.5	He recits the Ashvina hymn.
18.2.6	He atatins the world of the yonder.
18.2.7	He recitcs the Saura hymn.
18.2.8	There is indeed a fourth world of the gods, the waters.
18.2.9	He attains that by that.
18.2.10	He recita the Praga tha hymn.
18.2.11	The Praga tha is indeed the cattle.
18.2.12	for the attainment of cattle.
18.2.13	The Barhaspatya is the Prastara. The Barhaspatya indeed is the Prāṇa and Apāna.
18.2.16	He recites the Dyāvāpṛthivi hymn.
18.2.17	Heaven and earth are the foundation. By means of the foundation.
18.2.18	He recits the Dvipada hymn.
18.2.19	The Dvipada is the foundation. By the foundation.
18.2.20	The Barhspatya is the Paridada.
18.2.21	Brihaspati is Brahman.
18.2.22	It rests finally in Brahman.
18.2.23	Now this is the prosperity:
18.2.24	Three hundred Gāyatrī verses, two hundred Brihatī verses,
18.2.25	Seventy-seven Anushtubh verses, seventy-seven Paṅktis, forty-four hundred Brihatīs,
18.2.26	Having extracted three hundred Gāyatrīs from three hundred Triṣṭubhs, those three hundred Brihatīs,
18.2.27	And those two hundred and fifty Gāyatrī verses, and those two hundred and twenty-five Jagatī verses, and those four hundred and fifty Brihatī verses.
18.2.28	Fifty-five Tristubh verses, fifty-five Ushnih verses, and one hundred Brihatī verses are completed.
18.2.29	And those seven hundred and fifty Brihati verses are completed here.
18.2.30	And those two hundred and forty-five Tristubha verses and the two-footed verses are completed as Brihatī verses.
18.2.31	The thousand verses of the various metres are completed by the thousand Brihatis.
18.2.32	One should not praise more than a thousand, nor less than a thousand. This is indeed the stability.
18.3.1	But the glory of the Asvins is indeed designated.
18.3.2	This is the Agniya sacrifice.
18.3.3	One should indeed not deviate from the Agniya sacrifice.
18.3.4	Now if a rite for Agni is performed before the proper time,
18.3.5	one should follow the asterisms of the Ashvins, whatever is related to the two gods.
18.3.6	In a rite for Surya, the Pavamani verses are according to the meter.
18.3.7	The Gāyatrī verses in the Gāyatrī, the Tristubh verses in the Tristubh, the Jagatī verses in the Jagatī.
18.3.8	All the parts of Surya are in the abode of Surya.
18.3.9	All the Indra-related verses, in the place of the Prastara.
18.3.10	All the verses related to heaven and earth, in the place for heaven and earth.
18.3.11	All the two-footed verses, in the two-footed place.
18.3.12	All the Barhaspatya verses, before the Paridhananiya.
18.3.13	This is the only verse that is not prescribed.
18.3.14	Now the Asvin verse is like a wheel.
18.3.15	And the axle was made firm.
18.3.16	And the chariot of you two, O Asvins, for the hawk-like flight. That is the Uddhi.
18.3.17	Then there are four Agastya-carts yoked.
18.3.18	This is indeed the divine chariot.
18.3.19	By means of this divine chariot he attains the heavenly world in safety.
18.3.20	It should be with Suparna.
18.3.21	Suparna is indeed the life.
18.3.22	Just as a bird, having become a bird, attains the auspicious world of heaven.
18.3.23	The Ashvins are invoked twice, once at the beginning and once at the end.
18.3.24	Just as one runs without being held back by an obstacle, so is it.
18.4.1	Now, the examination of the end.
18.4.2	If the sun were to rise beyond the horizon,
18.4.3	If the Hotṛ himself were to consecrate him.
18.4.4	If his mouth were to be filled with blood.
18.4.5	If all the rays were to strike him.
18.4.6	This is the time for putting on the robe.
18.4.7	At this time, indeed, he becomes free from sin, separated from sin.
18.4.8	He who puts on the robe at this time, removes sin and is separated from sin.
18.4.9	Now if it is cloudy,
18.4.10	that is his form by which he sustains the creatures.
18.4.11	This is the one, namely this Prāṇa, in the Self.
18.4.12	Thinking, "He has disappeared," one should offer it.
18.4.13	One should offer a shining oblation, not recognized in the sun.
18.4.14	One who is not employed,
18.4.15	becomes manifest from them.
18.4.16	One should offer with two (verses).
18.4.17	For it is said that the Asvins are offered with two (verses)
18.4.18	Having recited the Anāvan Gāyatrī, one recites the half-verse of Viraj.
18.4.19	Viraj is prosperity, food.
18.4.20	One stands firm in prosperity, in Viraj, in food.
18.4.21	One makes the Vasat-offering with the northern half-verse of Virāj.
18.4.22	Heaven itself places the sacrificer in that world.
18.4.23	"Kauṣītaki indeed said, "One should sacrifice to Viraj."
18.4.24	Viraj has thirty-three syllables.
18.4.25	There are thirty-three deities.
18.4.26	He makes the deities share the syllables.
18.4.27	"The two Ashvins, with Vayu, are well-skilled," thus it is established. Ashvini is a Tristubh verse with the morning twilight.
18.4.28-33	The Soma-offerings are indeed made at the end of the night. The Tristubh is indeed strength and energy. He thus places strength and energy in the sacrificer. He pronounces the Vasat-call. For the appeasement of the offerings. For the establishment of the offerings. When the Chandomas have been combined, he offers the offerings in the Homa-rite.
18.4.34	The great weapon is speech and mind, and the two are delighted.
18.5.1	Then they perform the Hariyajna.
18.5.2	The Hariyajna itself delights them.
18.5.3	Here the gods with horses become delighted.
18.5.4	Having recited the Puronuvākyā of the Hariyajña in Tristubh, he offers in Jagati.
18.5.5	Strength and valour are Tristubh.
18.5.6	Jagati is cattle.
18.5.7-13	The strength itself is established in the animals at the very least. The Yajya is dedicated to Madhu, and the third pressing is like Madhu. One recites the Anuvshada for the sake of peace of the offerings. For the sake of the establishment of the offerings. One should take the most of the cooked grains. The cooked grains are indeed animals. One thus places the animals in one's own self.
18.5.14	Then, when they recite the Rk, they perform the rite of blessing.
18.5.15	They pour it at the end of the ashes of the Ahavaniya fire.
18.5.16	The Ahavaniya fire is the womb of animals.
18.5.17	They thus place them in their own stable without moving away.
18.5.18	Then they offer the Shakalas.
18.5.19	Just as a snake sheds its old skin,
18.5.20	or a reed from the Muñja grass,
18.5.21	In the same way, they are completely freed from all sin.
18.5.22	Then, turning to the left, they approach the Soma in the water.
18.5.23	They find them here within the Veda.
18.5.24	That is the abode of Soma.
18.5.25	They spread out the darbha grass.
18.5.26	When the waters and plants come together,
18.5.27	Then the entire Soma
18.5.28	They lead them with the Vaisnavya verse.
18.5.29	Yajna is indeed Vishnu.
18.5.30	They thus establish them in Yajna at the end.
18.6.1	Then they touch the breaths.
18.6.2	Whatever is done to the breaths here, whatever is destroyed, that they thus nourish and heal.
18.6.3	They make the vessels for the oblations.
18.6.4	By eating human food, they make the divine food disappear.
18.6.5	The Avabhrtha (rite).
18.6.6	They seek him through the Savanas, who shines there.
18.6.7	The rising sun at the morning Savana,
18.6.8	the sun in the middle at the midday Savana,
18.6.9	and the setting sun at the third Savana.
18.6.10	He indeed, entering the waters, becomes Varuna.
18.7.1	Therefore they offer a cake on one potsherd to Varuna.
18.7.2	Sri is one-footed.
18.7.3	Varuna is Sri.
18.7.4	They thus stand at the end in Sri.
18.7.5	They go out between the Catvala and the mound.
18.7.6	That is the way of the sacrifice, the attainment of the goal.
18.7.7	That is stated in this verse:
18.7.8-12	What is the rite of bathing here? By this very rite, the gods attained the sacrifice and obtained all their desires. In the same way, the sacrificer, by this very rite, attains the sacrifice and obtains all his desires. They go around facing the direction in which the waters are,
18.7.13	That is the eastern direction in which the deities are.
18.7.14	He offers four Prāyājas, excluding the one on the sacrificial grass.
18.7.15	He releases the one on the grass.
18.7.16	For the sacrificial grass is not spread here.
18.7.17	The two Ajyabhāgas are offered for the sake of destroying sin.
18.7.18	And then his sacrifice becomes complete from the Soma sacrifice.
18.7.19	Some perform the Apasumanti.
18.7.20	But they are indeed the Varatran-slayers.
18.7.21	Now, when one offers to Varuna in water,
18.7.22	one pleases him in his own abode.
18.7.23	And when one offers to Agni and Varuna,
18.7.24	Agni becomes a sharer in all the oblations here.
18.7.25	One offers two Anuyajas without the Barhis.
18.7.26	He releases the Barhis.
18.7.21	Barhis is progeny.
18.7.28	"So that he does not destroy progeny in water."
18.8.1	There are one hundred Prayajas and Upayajas.
18.8.2	Man has a hundred years of life, a hundred powers, a hundred senses.
18.8.3	He who is one hundred and one is the Self.
18.8.4	This is the path of the Angirasas.
18.8.5	He, by this path, attains the world and union with the Angiras.
18.8.6	Now those six or eight Vasat-utterances,
18.8.7	that is the path of the Adityas.
18.8.8	He, by this path attains the world and the union with the Adityas
18.8.9	The Anubandhya (hymn)
18.8.10	This Anubandhya is the fourth pressing.
18.8.11	Therefore she is not to be omitted.
18.8.12	For this is the fourth pressing.
18.8.13	She is indeed the Maitrāvaruṇa (pressing).
18.8.14	For the Agniṣṭoma (pressing) has been performed before.
18.8.15	Therefore she is the Maitrāvaruņa (pressing).
18.8.16	In order that the sacrifice may be complete.
18.8.17	And when he offers to Varuna in the water,
18.8.18	Here Mitra is deficient.
18.8.19	Therefore, it is performed as the Maitrāvaruṇa rite.
18.8.20	For the sake of following Mitra alone.
18.8.21	Now if an animal that has been tied up but not yet offered dies,
18.8.22	they should make it for the priests.
18.8.23	Then they should offer another animal of the same form and color.
18.8.24	They should lead it away towards the north, having sprinkled it with water and set fire to it.
18.8.25	They should plough the field according to the proper procedure.
18.8.26	They should offer the oblations of the two separately, after digging out separately, cooking separately, and taking separately, at the same Vaṣaṭkāra.
18.8.27	They should offer the Pasupuroḍāśa oblations of the both separately, after cooking separately, and carrying separately, at the single Vaṣaṭkārā.
18.8.28	They should make the oblations of both separately, after baking separately, and carrying them separately, at the one Vaṣaṭ-utterance.
18.8.29	Thus the third and fourth buttocks.
18.8.30	If, however, one were to be pleased with the unpleasant,
18.8.31	then it would be abundant with that alone. That is the position.
18.8.32	The Apryas are the vital airs.
18.8.33	He places those vital airs in him.
18.9.1	Now if there were eight feet, how would it be?
18.9.2	The embryo, the skin, the fat, the form, the Fālinī-offering, the embryo-offering, having cooked the embryo in the Sāmitra, they should offer in the Sāmi-tra itself at the Vasat-utterances.
18.9.3	The Rakshas indeed go to this sacrifice when it is like this.
18.9.4	He repels them with that.
18.9.5	That is the Rakshas-repelling.
18.9.6	If the animal becomes the Anūbandhya (animal), then thus.
18.9.17	"Pīvase" is the form of fat for the Vapa.
18.9.18	"What is the best, not too much, good gifts" is for the Purorasa.
18.9.19	"The best" is like the Purorasa being abundant.
18.9.20	"May the arms spread out for life" is for the oblation.
18.9.21	"Arms" is the form for the limbs of the oblation. The oblation is placed on the right side.
18.9.22	One sleeps facing north.
18.9.23	For the world of the living is facing north.
18.9.24	Having gone to the north, he offers the full oblation with the Vaisnavya verse.
18.9.25	Indeed, sacrifice is Vishnu.
18.9.26	He thus begins the sacrifice.
18.9.27	The oblation is in five potsherds.
18.9.28	The Pankti has five feet.
18.9.29	The sacrifice is indeed fivefold. For the attainment of the sacrifice.
18.9.30	If it is in eight potsherds, then it is the full-moon ritual.
18.9.31	The full moon is indeed the establishment; it is for establishment.
18.9.32	This is indeed the actual form of the re-installation, namely the verses and the Yajya and Puronuvākyā.
18.9.33	They are arranged in the same way.
18.9.34	When it is completed, the sacrificer offers the Agnihotra.
18.9.35	For when the installation of the fire is completed, the Agnihotra is offered.
18.9.36	Therefore, when it is established, the sacrificer should offer the Agnihotra. The sacrificer should offer Agnihotra.
19.1.1	They, about to be initiated, deposit the fires.
19.1.2	In this way, the sacrificers place their strength and energy in themselves.
19.1.3	Then they perform this Isti called Sannivapaniyam.
19.1.4-9	They offer to Agni the Brahman-possessed, a cake on eight potsherds. To Agni the lord of the kingdom, a cake on eleven potsherds. To Agni the lord of creatures, a cake on twelve potsherds. Thus they ascend the Brahman and the kingdom. By these two they cross the year in safety. They perform this sacrifice to Prajapati.
19.1.10	"May we enjoy this year, born from Prajapati, in peace."
19.1.11	Some perform it as belonging to Vayu.
19.1.12	"For this is the visible form of Prajapati, namely, Vayu."
19.1.13	Some perform the Agnihotra for Kama.
19.1.14	Kama is the lord of the gods.
19.1.15	For the satisfaction of all the gods.
19.1.14	Some of them perform the animal-sacrifice to Vaisvānara.
19.1.15	For the satisfaction of all the gods.
19.1.16	Some of them perform the Vaiśvānara animal-sacrifice.
19.1.17	This is the Vaiśvânara, who shines yonder.
19.1.18	They satisfy him.
19.1.19	Now, the sacrificial post which is to be erected for many persons who are to be initiated, is to be erected only for one person who is to be initiated.
19.1.20	They make the arrangements for the initiation and the consecration of the Soma-pressing ceremony in advance.
19.1.21	They should be initiated on the new-moon day after one day.
19.1.22	They say that it is in the month of Māgha.
19.1.23	Both of them are mentioned.
19.1.24	But the latter is more appropriate.
19.2.2	They first obtain that.
19.2.3	They begin with the twenty-four.
19.2.4	That is the beginning of the beginning.
19.2.5	It moves north for six months.
19.2.6	They follow it with the six upward days.
19.2.7	Having moved north for six months, it stands turning to the south.
19.2.8	Those who are going to perform the Vaisuvarī sacrifice stay here during the spring solstice.
19.2.9	They obtain it for the second time.
19.2.10	He goes south for six months.
19.2.11	They follow him with six days of rotation.
19.2.12	Having gone south for six months, he stands facing north, about to turn.
19.2.13	Those who are going to perform the Mahavrata sacrifice stay in this (house).
19.2.14	They obtain that third (day).
19.2.15	Because they obtain it thrice.
19.2.16	The year is divided into three parts.
19.2.17	For the attainment of the year.
19.2.18	This is sung about it:
19.2.19	The wise ones, arranging the days and nights, like the hairs, 
19.2.20	The sun moves six months to the south, and six months to the north.
19.2.21	He moves six months to north.
19.2.22	Six months to the south.
19.2.23	Now some perform this Isti of the Initiation with five oblations at the time of kindling the fire.
19.2.24	The sacrifice is fivefold; for the attainment of the sacrifice.
19.2.25	Now some perform the Atithya sacrifice with five oblations.
19.2.26	The sacrifice is fivefold; for the attainment of the sacrifice.
19.2.27	Now he performs the Bahv Agni rites.
19.2.28	For they offer many fires.
19.2.29	Therefore he performs the Bahva Agni rites.
19.2.30	They are four in number.
19.2.31	This is the fourfold universe.
19.2.32	For the attainment of this whole universe.
19.2.33	The first three times with the first, the last three times with the last, eight are obtained.
19.2.34	The Gayatri has eight syllables.
19.2.35	Agni is indeed Gayatri, the Gayatri is the metre.
19.2.36	They indeed draw Agni with his own metre.
19.2.37	They are indeed whispered.
19.2.38	The impregnation of semen is indeed the Agnihotra.
19.2.39	Semen is indeed impregnated in a whisper.
19.2.40	They become similar.
19.2.41	Whatever is suitable in the sacrifice, that is prosperous, for the prosperity of the sacrifice.
19.2.42	Then they build it up as much as they desire.
19.2.43	Then they praise the built-up (fire) with Sāman chants.
19.3.1	Then they say to the Hotr, "Praise Agni with hymns."
19.3.2	Indeed, this Rudra, the fierce one among the gods, becomes fierce when built up.
19.3.3	They appease him.
19.3.4	He offers to the Vaiśvānara Agni whose name is known.
19.3.5	For then his name is known when they carry the fires.
19.3.6	Now, the rite for one day.
19.3.7	The carrying of the sacrificial posts, the carrying of the fires of Agni and Soma, the animal for Agni and Soma, its Brāhmaṇa is known.
19.3.8-14	Then they offer the animal-oblation of the Agniṣṭoma, and the oblations for the gods, in succession. These are the deities who control the oblations. They gratify them here. They, being gratified, give the oblations. Therefore, it is called Devassu. They are eight in number. By these, the gods obtained all the eight kinds of prosperity.
19.3.15	In the same way, the sacrificers attain all the eight stages through these (sacrifices).
19.3.16	Here some offer oblations for the entire Agnihotra.
19.3.17	The entire Agnihotra is indeed everything.
19.3.18	(They think) 'We shall attain everything by everything.'
19.3.19	There are ten oblations.
19.3.20	The Viraj has ten parts.
19.3.21	Viraj is prosperity, food.
19.3.22	For the attainment of the food of Shri and Viraj.
19.3.23	Then they offer as long as they desire.
19.3.24	Then when the oblation for Anubandhya has been placed, they perform with the animal dedicated to Tvashtri.
19.3.25	Tvashtri is the one who impregnates semen.
19.3.26	They perform in the wife's house.
19.3.27	Semen is indeed deposited in wives.
19.3.28	They perform silently.
19.3.29	Retahsikti is Tvashtra.
19.3.30	Semen is indeed deposited secretly.
19.3.31	They throw it away after having encircled it with fire, and do not establish it.
19.3.32	Retahsikti is indeed Tvashtra. 
19.3.33	"Let not the semen deposited before time be established,"
19.4.1	They say, "When he invokes these two deities, Tvashtra and the tree, where are they established for him?"
19.4.2	The deities at the Prayāja offerings are indeed the same.
19.4.3	They are indeed the same deities at the Iṣṭi.
19.4.4	Then they offer the Pasupuroḍāśa of the Anūbandhya and the oblations to the Devakās.
19.4.5	The metres of him who performs a Soma sacrifice become exhausted.
19.4.6	The Devakās are indeed the metres.
19.4.7	Now, when they offer oblations to the Devīkas,
19.4.8	then they become fresh and returning.
19.4.9	And indeed, the Devīkas are the feminine forms of the metres, for those who perform the Soma sacrifice.
19.4.10	The Devīkas are indeed the metres.
19.4.11	Now, when they offer the oblations to the Devikās,
19.4.12	it is for the sake of the freshness of the metres.
19.4.13	Those are indeed the goddesses.
19.4.14	And who is that Prajapati?
19.4.15	From him the Devakas.
19.4.16	Those are indeed the five oblations.
19.4.17	The Pankti has five feet.
19.4.18	The sacrifice is indeed the Pankti, for the attainment of the sacrifice.
19.4.19	Here some offer oblations to the goddesses.
19.4.20	The entire Agnihotra is indeed the entire Agnihotra.
19.4.21	We shall attain everything with everything.
19.4.22	Those are the ten oblations.
19.4.23	The Viraj has ten parts.
19.4.24	Viraj is prosperity, food.
19.4.25	For the attainment of prosperity, Viraj, and food.
19.4.26	Here some perform the rites of the directions.
19.4.27	Everything is in the Agnihotra.
19.4.28	We attain everything with everything.
19.4.29	Those are the six oblations.
19.4.30	The six seasons are the year.
19.4.31	For the attainment of the year.
19.4.32	Then, when the Upavasatha has been completed, one should offer the Payasya sacrifice to Mitra-Varuna. Its Brāhmaṇa has been stated.
19.4.33	One should not engage in sexual intercourse without performing this sacrifice.
19.5.1	The twenty-fourth (day) is indeed the face of the year.
19.5.2	Therefore it is the Agniṣṭoma.
19.5.3	For the Agniṣṭo ma is the face of sacrifices.
19.5.4	They thus gratify the year from the very face.
19.5.5	They perform the Ekādasa (Stoma) for it.
19.5.6	For the prosperity of the sacrifice.
19.5.7	Its Stoma is twenty-four.
19.5.8	There are twenty-four half-months in a year.
19.5.9	For the attainment of the year.
19.5.10	He has three hundred and sixty Stotriya verses.
19.5.11	There are three hundred and sixty days in a year.
19.5.12	They attain the days of the year.
19.5.13	His Brihat is the last verse.
19.5.14	This is the second day and the second Brihat verse.
19.5.15	Therefore his Brihat is the final verse.
19.5.16	Now, where they perform the twenty-four-fold Stoma,
19.5.17	there the Mahāvrata is fixed.
19.5.18	The Brhat is the base of the Mahāvrta.
19.5.19	Therefore, the Brhat should be the base of this day.
19.5.20	Its forms are the metres, which are recited in the order of the year.
19.5.21	The Hotr was born as the knower. This is the eight-verse offering of ghee, consisting of Gāyatrī verses alone.
19.5.22	The Stoma is indeed Gāyatrī alone.
19.5.23	That is the successful rite, when it is accomplished with Stoma.
19.5.24	The Prauga of Madhuccanda is indeed successful.
19.5.25	Other Praugas are formed according to its form.
19.5.26	My first rite has been accomplished successfully.
19.5.27	"O thee, O chariot, as thou art, as thou art," is the first verse of the Marutvatīya.
19.5.28	"This is the Soma pressed for thee, O Vasu," is the Anucara.
19.5.29	This is the only one-day sacrifice. Its Brāhmaṇa has been explained.
19.6.1	"With what good, with the same nest, the same age," is the Marutvatya.
19.6.2	"The best of these, O Maghavan, what is not thine?" is the ninth.
19.6.3	Having recited the Uttaras, he should offer them in the east.
19.6.4	For they are the Maruts.
19.6.5	Now this is the Niskekvalya (verse).
19.6.6	Therefore he offers with this (verse).
19.6.7	There is a similarity in that (verse). The Maruts mixed together.
19.6.8	That is the year. He calls it the year.
19.6.9	That is this day's form.
19.6.10	That is the highest in all worlds, the sole, the great of heaven.
19.6.11	Here the Hotṛ sprinkles the semen with the great of heaven;
19.6.12	Then he generates it with the great of the year on the day of the Great Vrata.
19.6.13	In the year, the semen is generated and born;
19.6.14	In that (year) there is (the verse), 'They pour for thee the new (Soma) at the beginning of the feasts.'
19.6.15	He recites the Savitrī verse.
19.6.16	This is the form of this day.
19.6.17	"Today we choose the Savitar of Savitar, the god." The Pratipa and Anucharas of the Vaishvadev are always recited. Their Brāhmaṇa has been explained.
19.6.18	"This is the great deed of the god Savitar." This is the Savitar verse.
19.6.19	In that (verse) there is (the word) 'having offspring', 'may it bestow wealth on us'.
19.6.20	He praises the year.
19.6.21	That is the form of this day.
19.6.22	They (the verses) are of the heaven and earth, 'may the heaven and earth be auspicious to all'.
19.6.23	In that (verse) is (the word), 'bestowing', 'may it confer strength on us'.
19.6.24	He announces the year.
19.6.25	That is the form of this day.
19.6.26	"What is the best, what is the most excellent, has not come today?"
19.6.27	In that (day) there is the year. Today it is announced.
19.6.28	He announces the year directly.
19.6.29	That is this day's form.
19.6.30	"The lord of the sacrifice, the lord of the people, is your chariot." This is the Sāryāta Vaisvadevam.
19.6.31	"In him there is Indra, Mitra, Varuna, and the creator."
19.6.32	He praises the year, the year.
19.6.33	That is the form of this day.
19.6.34	"To Vaisvānara, the wise one, the one who grows in truth." This is the Vaisvānariyam.
19.6.35	In that (verse) there is (the word) 'ratha' and 'kulisa' is connected with the mind.
19.6.36	It is called 'Samvatsara' (year).
19.6.37	That is the form of this day.
19.6.38	(The verse) 'To Vishnu, to Sharda, to the wise, to the creator' is Marut.
19.6.39	In that (verse) is (the word), 'giri' and 'samañje' is connected with 'vidathas'.
19.6.40	It is called Samvatsara (year).
19.6.41	This is the form of this day.
19.6.42	"The verse, "May we prosper through the sacrifice, O Jātavedas," is addressed to Jātavedā.
19.6.43	" "In it (the verse) there is the word "sandadāsvān," "bestowing," and "rayi," "wealth," and "didihi," "bestow."
19.6.44	It is the same as the year.
19.6.45	This is the form of that day.
19.7.1	Now on this day some Chāndogas perform the entire Stoma.
19.7.2	By this day we attain the six-day period.
19.7.3	By the six-day (period) the year.
19.7.4	Those who are in the year.
19.7.5	They say that the six-day is the whole year.
19.7.6	If they do so,
19.7.7	he should arrange the sacrificial rite according to the six-day.
19.7.8	The ghee of the first day is the ghee.
19.7.11	What is the Nishekalya of the fourth day, that is the Nisheka.
19.7.12	What is the Vaishvadev of the fifth day, that is Vaishvadev.
19.7.13	What is Agni-Marut of the sixth day, that is Agni-Maruta.
19.7.14	There, having taken all the Stotriyas of the Prsthya at the end, and having made them into a Prastara after the Prastara, one should chant for the attainment of the six-day (rite).
19.7.15	Just as the Chandogas attain the six-day (ritual) by this day, and the year by the six-day ritual,
19.7.16	and all the desires that are in the year,

22.6.4	By this day indeed the gods went to the heavenly world.
22.6.5	They went seeking it.
22.6.6	Therefore one should say,

23.1.20	"Agni was born to Atharvan" - this is a birth-verse.
23.1.21	This is the form of this day.

23.1.25	The Gāyatrī carries the morning Soma-press.
23.1.26	It does not depart from the form of the morning Soma-sacrifice.
23.1.27	Thus in the Vyuha.
23.1.28	Having taken out this Agni, men with rays, from the kindling wood, the clarified butter is Vairāja.
23.1.29	The Vairāja is the back, it is with hair.

23.2.2	The sacrifice is resumed on the fourth day.
23.2.3	He thus resumes the sacrifice.
23.2.4	"Listen to the call, O Indra, do not be angry" (thus) the Marutvatya verse.

23.2.17	The midday is in the Gāyatrī, for this three-day period is midday.
23.2.18	Now, indeed, one should recite the Nighosa here. Here.
23.2.19	The Nighosa is for the Stotriya and Anurupya and for the Ukthamukha.
23.2.20	Then one should not be angry.
23.2.21	The Stotriya is the Self, the Anurupya is the offspring.
23.2.22	The Nīghosa is food.
23.2.23	He places food in himself and in the offspring.
23.2.24	Some say, "One should recite the Nīghosa in the Anushtubh metre."
23.2.25	The fourth day is in the Anushtubh metre.
23.2.26	He thus makes it complete with its own metre.
23.2.27	One should make the Newkh verse in the Viraj metre. That is the position.
23.2.28	Food is Viraj, food is Newkh.
23.2.29	He thus places food in the sacrifice and in the sacrificers.
23.2.30	One should recite the Newkh verse at the middle place.
23.2.31	The first place is the Self, the best of creatures.
23.2.32	The middle is the middle place.
23.2.33	In the middle is this food of the self placed.
23.2.34	One should eat food according to one's appetite.
23.2.35	"Indra is the deity of the eight-verse hymn."
23.2.36	By this, the gods attained all the eight-verses.
23.2.37	In the same way, the sacrificers attain all the eight-verse hymns by this.
23.2.38	Those who are known as Kuha-shruti.
23.2.39	They are the Anuṣṭubh verses of Viraj.
23.2.40	They are performed here.
23.2.41	Because they are endowed with the form of the day.
23.2.42	"The verse "O lord of the bull, the lord of the world, the lord of heaven, the lord of earth, the lord of men, the lord of cattle, the lord of wealth, the lord of all, the lord of everything, the lord of this world, the lord who is the lord of the three worlds, the lord who rules over the three worlds," is known as the Trayastubha, the receptacle of the Soma-pressing. Its meaning has been explained."
23.2.43	"The meaning of "lord of the world" is "lord of heaven."
23.2.44	Or, "lord of everything" is its form.
23.3.3	The form of this (verse) is 'with the help of'.

23.3.5	The form of the Pravargya is 'coming' or 'going'.
23.3.6	Therefore, the Sūktas of Āvanti and Pravanti are recited on the fourth day in the form of the Prāyaṇīya.
23.3.7	For the fourth day is indeed a repetition of the Prāyaṇa.
23.3.8	The verses are recited in pairs.
23.3.9	One should advance in pairs.
23.3.10	That is the form for advancing.
23.3.11	Just as one would dwell in the heaven of the upper world, so is it.
23.3.12-17	The praise of the Asura is the Vaishvantarī. "The "Samrāḍ" is the one who rules." "The ". " The "Samrāṭ" is his form. "Who has made him manifest, the men with nests?" This is the Marut. Its Brāhmaṇa is the same as that of the Prashukriya. "May the steeds go forth with their strength, with the fires. Three more are added in the Samūḍha.
23.3.18	We invoke thee, O mighty one, for help.
23.3.19	The Pravargya rite is either the going or the coming.
23.3.20	Therefore, in the fourth day, the hymns are recited in the form of the Pravargya rite, because the fourth day is the repetition of the Pravargaya rite.
23.3.21	The Pravarygya rite is the repetition of it.
23.3.22	"Homage to you, O Jātavedas, the well-shining, the well-spoken."
23.3.23	That is the Brahman of the Marutvatīya.
23.3.24	"He sings the Vasu, the variegated, the great."
23.3.25	"He invites the Brahman to sing the Gāyatrī, the Gāyatrīs."
23.3.26	"It is either the Prāyaniya form or the Prāyaniyī form."
23.3.27	Therefore, in the fourth day, the hymns are recited in the Prāyani form, in the form of the Prāyani.
23.3.28	The fourth day is the Prāyaniya.
23.3.29	Having approached the Ukthyas, they perform the Sodashin.

23.3.36	Brihaspati and the Moon are the rulers.

23.4.4	These are its forms of metres.
23.4.5	"It is like a bull, like a cow, like milk, like ghee, like honey, like wealth, like speed, like a seat."
23.4.6	"This is your guest, the one who knows the dawn." This is the ghee.

23.4.8	Or this is its form.
23.4.9	"The seat is its form."
23.4.10	The Jagat (verse) is the morning pressing, for this is the three-day (rite).
23.4.11	Thus it is when the (verses) are arranged.
23.4.12	Having recited this, one should think of Agni as Vasu. When arranged, it is the Paṅkti (verse).
23.4.13	The Paṅkti (verses) are the fifth day.
23.4.14	What is this day, those are these (verses).
23.4.15	They go to the setting sun.

"Thus indeed, O Soma, in the intoxication,"; it is like intoxication, the Paṅkti. Its Brāhmaṇa has been explained.
23.4.23	The six verses beginning with "O Agni, the wise, the wise, O Agni, the wise" are to be recited.
23.4.24	There are six seasons in a year.
23.4.25	For the attainment of the year.
23.4.26	Kaushitika said, "The Gāyatrī-chanting is the praise."

23.5.1	The Mahānāmnī verses are at the end.
23.5.2	Indra killed Vṛtra with the Mahānāmnīs.
23.5.3	Having killed Vṛtra, the gods stood in front of him.
23.5.4	They were afraid and stood back from him.
23.5.5	Prajapati asked him, "Are you able to kill?"
23.5.6	He replied, "Yes, yes," in an obscure way.
23.5.7	Prajapati is not defined.

23.5.19	This is the time for the Ṛc.
23.5.20	These are indeed the Śakvarī verses.
23.5.21	By these Indra was able to slay Vritra.
23.5.22	And because by these he was able to slay Vrtra,
23.5.23	therefore the Sakvaris are called Saktis (the able ones).

23.5.26	"Thus indeed you are the protector of heroes." Thus indeed the city is established. The words "of the excrement" and "of the excreta" are similar.

23.6.38	The upward direction, the winter among the seasons.
23.6.39	The Maruts are the gods, the Rudra class of gods, the lord.
23.7.1	Animals are the fifth day, and man alone is the sixth day.
23.7.2-8	That person is Prajapati, the first of all this. Prajapati is the supreme. That is the form of Prajapati. He (Indra) attacked the Asura Indra, making a mound at every step. Indra, desiring to conquer her, made a mound at every step. Indra is the mound. Everything was conquered by Indra.
23.7.9	She became that.
23.7.10	He was seized by the Asura's deception.
23.7.11	He saw these again.
23.7.12	From each limb, from each joint, he was freed from all sin by them.
23.7.13	That which is praised as the Paru-shep on the sixth day, and in the middle of the Hotr-s
23.7.14	From limb to limb they are released from all sin, at every festival.
23.7.15	Having performed the regular offerings, they offer with the Paruṣīpī (verses).
23.7.16	On that day they do not utter the Vasat-call.
23.7.17	They are released by that.
23.7.18	And because they do not obstruct them,
23.7.19	"Do not let us hinder the beloved of the gods, the sacrifice."
23.8.1	Having performed the regular rites of the seasons, they offer sacrifices with the Gartsamadī verses.
23.8.2	Because they do not offer the Vasat-call with these verses on that day.
23.8.3	They are released by that.
23.8.4	And because they do not hinder them,
23.8.5	"We do not obstruct the beloved of the gods, the sacrifice."
23.8.6	By that they become Atichandas.
23.8.7	Thus their Vasat-utterance becomes seven-footed.
23.8.8	Now, Kauṣītaki said this:
23.8.9	"The Viraj indeed protects the eight metres, which are the one who shines.
23.8.10	Those who sacrifice with excessive desires are deluded by that wealth.
23.8.11	Therefore, one should sacrifice only with daily offerings.
23.8.12	For the uninterrupted path to the heavenly world.
23.8.13	Then a small boy, the householder Jaigishavya, approached the sage who was seated in the sacrificial hall and asked him:
23.8.14	"What is the meaning of the day?"
23.8.15-21	They remained silent. Then from the other half of the assembly, Citra of Gauśra-yana said: "Gauśra has gone to the other world, not to the other world. He has gone to the world of the dead, not to the other world." We have gone to the world beyond, to the world beyond. We have gone by the one-day rites, to the other world.
23.8.22	As befits them, they should offer.
23.8.23	The sixth day is the abode of the gods.
23.9.1	If the Hotṛ were to pronounce the Vasat-call on that day,
23.9.2	the Hotṛ and the Adhvaryu would unite the abode of the god with the house of the householder.
23.9.3	They proceed to the heaven, to the world of heaven, with the sixth day.
23.9.4	He who completes the sacrifice without a fault, he wins the heavenly world.
23.9.5	Even if there is a fault,
23.9.6	one should repeatedly learn the rules of atonement.
23.9.7	This is the ladle of man, the holder of the oblation. This is the ladle.
23.9.8	This is an undefined term.
23.9.9	Prajapati is undefined.
23.9.10	That is the form of Prajapati.
23.9.11	The Atichandas verses have seven feet. The Punaḥpadas are the same.
23.9.12	What is this day, those are they.
23.9.13	One should not go between a Padas and a Punaḥpada.
23.9.14	The Padas are the Self, the Punaḥpāda is the Prāṇa.
23.9.15	One who would say that there
23.9.16	One would go between the Prāṇa and the Self, one would not live. Thus it would be.
23.9.17	Therefore, one does not go from one foot to another without intervening.
23.9.18	The Prāga is of the Ātichandas metre.
23.9.19	The sixth day is Ātichandas.
23.9.20	He thus makes it complete with its own metre.
23.9.21	The first verse is 'The great one before' for the Marutvatīya.
23.9.22	The word 'sa' is undefined.
23.9.23	Prajapati is undefined.
23.9.24	That is the form of Prajapati.
23.10.1-4	The Rathantara is the first of the three Stomas. The Marutvat is the second. The Vairupa is the third. The Rathantara is the fourth. The Maruta is the fifth. The Vairaja is the sixth. The Rathantaras are the seventh. The Marutas are the eighth. The Vairojas are the ninth. The Rathantaras are the tenth. The Maruts are the eleventh. The Vaisvas are the twelfth.

He who, the bull, is equal to the bulls, says the Vairupa. The known Trayastrimsa Stoma is the receptacle of the Savanas.

23.10.7	One should go from there to Kadru.
23.10.8	O Indra, O one with the Maruts, O one with praise, this is the Marutvatya Gayatri.
23.10.9	The Gayatri is in the middle of the day, because this three-day period is in the middle.
23.10.10	The Revati verses are for our good enjoyment. The Revata is indeed the Revata. The Varavantiya is carried in the Rivat's birthplace, the Sama in the Indra's verses.
23.10.11	That is the form of the pair for procreation.
23.10.12	"Do not praise anything else." This is the Prastara of the Sama.
23.10.13	"Do the friends not quarrel."
23.10.14	"Friends" is the form of everything.
23.10.15	The sixth day is the form of all.
23.10.16	Therefore he addresses all of them as 'friends'.
23.10.17	'O Indra, come to us, come hither', (he says) in the Paruchespa (Sutra).
23.10.18	'Come hither' means 'come from afar'.

23.11.4	And the sixth day is Prajapati's.

23.11.6	That is the form of Prajapati.
23.11.7	The one who is superior to the one who is superior, the one who is inferior to the one who has been spoken about in the Brahmana.
23.11.8	"The god Savitar, the illuminator, shines forth for the sacrifice." This is the Savitar hymn.

23.11.15	The sixth day is the end.
23.11.16	One dances having gone to the end.
23.11.17	For one goes beyond that.

23.11.26	The sixth day is within
23.11.27	One stands as if having gone to the
23.11.28	end. One may go beyond that.
23.11.26	The sixth day is within.
23.11.27	One stands as if going to the end.
23.11.28	One should go from there to the Kadru.
23.11.29	Two of them are left over, which are connected with the sacrifice and Dakṣiṇā. This is the Nārāśaṃsa verse.
23.11.30	The Sūkta is the Self, the Nārāsaṃsa is the offspring and cattle.

23.11.38	Its last form is that which has the sun.
23.11.39	This Stoma is for the one who deserves it, for the one who knows everything. It is for the one with knowledge of everything.
23.11.40	Its final form is that which has a moon.

24.1.2	The gods conquered these three worlds by conquering.
24.1.3	Therefore it becomes three times fourfold, with four directions.
24.1.4	The conqueror of the universe conquered these four directions.
24.1.5	Therefore, it is fourfold and three-fold.
24.1.6	The gods conquered by means of Abhijit and Abhijit.
24.1.7	And indeed, they conquered six times.
24.1.8	Whatever was not conquered, they conquered by means of Vishvajita.
24.1.9	Or, Vishvajita means "he who conquers the universe."
24.1.10	Indeed, these two, Abhijit and Vishvajita, are Indra and Agni.
24.1.11-17	Agni is the conqueror. For Agni conquered all this. Indra is the conqueror of all. For Indra conquered all this. He is the conqueror. His Stoma is all. His Rathantara is the sixth. In the Pavamana of the Arbhava, the Brihat.
24.1.18	Therefore, both the verses are sung, the Barhaspatya and the Rathantara.
24.1.19	"Of him, the two verses, "To you, O Agni, the gods, what is most excellent, that is Agni," are both Rathantara and Barhaspatya."

24.2.5	In this way, one should recite.
24.2.6	The first three verses are in the Madhucchandas metre, and the last three in the Gartsamada metre.
24.2.7	They say, what is that which both should be joined together?
24.2.8	If the Madhucchanda is in front, then the Gartsamad and the Vaishvadev should be placed above it. The Madhucchandas and the Vaishvadevas should be placed above.
24.2.9	This is the one Nirukta of the Bharata.
24.2.10	All the gods have come, listen to my call.
24.2.11	Sit down on this sacrificial grass."
24.2.12	"Sacrificial grass" is the form of the Barhaspatya.

24.3.2-5	I shall now proclaim the heroic deeds of Indra. Having first chanted the golden stupa, he places the nidhi in this Barhaspatya Navarcha, saying, "That is the lowest and that is the highest." If the Rathantara is the background. If the Brihat is the background. He should place the nidhis of the Rathantara and Brihat after chanting the Barhaspatya in the beginning.
24.3.6	The two verses in the Ekāsukta (Sāman) are to be recited in the Niṣkevalya and Marutvatīya Sāmans. This is the settled rule.
24.3.7	"Drink Soma, O fierce one, whom thou hast struck down; praise him who has conquered by his strength." This is the Abhivatīya.
24.3.8	This is the form of Abhijit.
24.3.9	Now the one-day sacrifice is indeed the third pressing.
24.3.10	The one-day sacrifice indeed is Abhijit.
24.3.11	The one day is indeed the foundation; by means of the foundation.
24.4.1	Svabhanu, the Asura, struck the sun with darkness.
24.4.2	Those who were afraid of that darkness approached this seventeen-fold Stoma, the three-day (rite) before the equinox.
24.4.3	They destroyed the darkness before it.
24.4.4	It went before them.
24.4.5	They approached this same three-day (ritual) after the equinox.
24.4.6	Above that they removed darkness.
24.4.7	Beyond that it became.
24.4.8	Those who, knowing this, perform this three-day sacrifice with the two equinoxes,
24.4.9	they indeed remove sin from both worlds.
24.4.10	They are called the Svarasāmans.
24.4.11	These (priests) indeed, having approached the sun, removed it from darkness.
24.4.12	And because they removed it,
24.4.13	therefore they are called Svarasāmans.
24.4.14	This is stated in a verse:
24.4.15	"The Asura Svarbhanu struck the sun with darkness.
24.4.16	The Atriyas found it, for none else could."

24.7.9	As the Senas are arranged, so they are arranged in all worlds and in all desires.
24.7.10	If the Svaras are the Prsthas,
24.7.11	then the Sama-singers perform in the Pavamana-s.
24.7.12	If the Bṛhat and Rathantara are the Prstha-s,
24.7.13	then the Sāma-singers perform the Svaras in the Pavamāna-s.
24.7.14	The verses are the same as the verses of the Sama. So says Kauṣītaki.
24.7.15	For these are the verses of the Sāman.

25.1.6	Therefore, the Sattra performers move forward for only six months and return six times.
25.1.7	For indeed, this is the middle between eating and death.

25.1.10	(They are) like the sun, like light, like lustre, like brilliance, like the shining, like the shining one.
25.1.11	The verse "A sweet wave has risen from the ocean" is for the ghee.

25.2.2	Who has settled the dawn with the sun," (thus) it is connected with the sun.

25.2.24	They obtain all their desires in Prajapati.
25.2.25	They say, "Let there be no Tristubh at the morning pressing; it confuses the mouth of the sacrifice, which is fixed in the metres."

25.3.15	And indeed these are the actual backs, the Brihat and Rathantara.
25.3.16	Therefore the Brihat should be the back of this day.
25.3.17	If they were to perform the Brihat in the Surya-vat Prastara.
25.3.16-20	Therefore, the Brihat should be the Prstha of this day. If they were to perform the Brihat in the Suryavati Praga tha, the Suryavati Pra ga tha would be in the form of this day. The Utkhaमुखीया is the one who knows Indra through hearing. He is the conqueror, the maker of the path, for the sun. Thus it is Suryavati. This is the form of this Ahina.
25.3.21-26	This is the position that the Mahādivākirya is the Prstha of this day. This is the direct Sama of this day, that which shines, namely the Mahādivākīrya. They honour him with his own Sama. Some perform it in Trishtup. This one who shines is Trishtup. They honour him with his form.

25.3.31	This shining one is indeed the one who is in the Jagatì metre.
25.3.32	He thus makes him prosper in his proper metre.

25.4.14	"He who is the one to be praised by the leaders" - this is the Tristubh verse.
25.4.15	"The heavenly lights in the sky" - in this form.
25.4.16	Thus, if the Mahadivakirtti is the background.
25.4.17	If they were to perform the Brihat in its own womb,
25.4.18	Having chanted the Brihat, he chants the womb of the Rathantara.
25.5.4	The Stotra is like the rays of the sun.
25.5.5	This is the form of this day.
25.5.6	The Anurūpa is "O Indra, a hundred of your rays" and "A thousand suns" is the Sūryavān.
25.5.7	This is its form.
25.5.8	The Sāman-Prāgātha is "He who protects from oppression, the one with great strength" and "In the bodies, in the waters, the sun" is the Sūrīyavān.
25.5.9	Here is the form of that day.
25.5.10-14	Then he recites the Yoni of Bṛhat and Rathantara. "It is said, "Indra indeed knows this through his hearing," The Brāhmaṇa of this is stated. " "He who is one to be invoked by the clansmen," This is Trishtubh. Its Brāhmaṇa is stated." If they were to perform the Bṛhat in its own Yoni or in another Yoni, If they were performing the Anubhayasāman,
25.5.15	The same for the Otkhyamukhiyas.
25.5.16	One should recite the Brihat and Rathantara verses.
25.5.17	"Recite him who is greater in strength." This is the Tristubh verse.

This is the form of this day. Both the Tristubh and Jagati meters are praised. The sun is indeed established in the Tristubh meter, shining in the Jagati meter. They touch him directly.
25.6.1-6	I praise your great deeds, O Maruts. He places the Niviḍa after having called out nine times. "O Surya, reveal yourself to the Maruts." This is the form of this day. For all the Maruts, there are four Abhiuḍaitis. "O Maghavan, may he come with truth, with strength." There are twenty-one verses.
25.6.7-13	These are the twenty-five verses. These are the six Jagatī verses: "Viśvajit, Dhanajit, Svarjit, these are the three; Indra, Soma, Yajatā, Haryata, these are the four." These are the thirty-one verses. Among these Jagatī verses, the Dūrohaṇa rises. This is the one who shines, the one who moves.
25.6.14	The sacrificer is the one who ascends.
25.6.15	The sacrificer indeed ascends this (world).
25.6.19	He attains the world of the atmosphere.
25.6.20	The third (world) is divided into three parts.
25.6.21	He attains the other world.
25.6.22	The entire world is the abode.
25.6.23	The third is divided into three, and the half-verse is divided into three.
25.6.24	He stands firm in this world.
25.6.25	In the firm, in the unshakable.

25.7.4	This is the form of this day.
25.7.5	They are forty-four.
25.7.6	"The flying insect is smeared with the Asura's deceit,". These are three.
25.7.7-13	Those shining with their own light, the thoughts of heaven, in this form. Those are forty-seven. "You, knowing, lead us to the vast world," in this form, with the three-fold Paridhananiya verse. "The heaven, the light, the fearlessness, the well-being," in this form. Those are fifty. The former are fifty-one. Those are one hundred verses.
25.7.14	Man has a life of a hundred years, a hundred joints, a hundred powers, and a hundred senses.
25.7.15	The world of the sacrificer is one hundred and one.
25.7.16	Here they purify the sacrificers.
25.7.17	Here they generate the sacrificers after purifying them with the first day of the Great Vrata. This is the opinion of Pingala.
25.7.18	Now the opinion of Kaushitaki:
25.7.19	The same as the Oukthya-mukhiyas.

25.8.20	They establish that light in the light itself.
25.8.21	Those who perform the Vaisuvarta sacrifice attain immortality.

25.10.17	They perform the Prishtha rites.
25.10.18	The Agni-offering is made with the verse, "The men kindle the fire from the kindling woods with the rays." This is the Vairaja offering.

25.11.11	The crafts are the lower breaths.
25.11.12	The sacrifice is the man.
25.11.13	His upward breaths are the morning pressing.
25.11.14	The Self is midday.
25.11.15	His downward breaths are the third pressing and those are the arts.
25.11.16	Therefore, arts are praised at the third pressing.
25.11.17	This is their abode.
25.11.18-23	Now, at the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice, in the year-long sacrifice, in the Viśvajit sacrifice, in the Sarvapṛṣṭha sacrifice, at midday, the arts are praised. The Pṛṣṭhas are the self. The arts are the vital airs. The vital airs do not shine without the self. Nor does the self without the vital airs. They are not different.
25.11.24	Therefore, even at midday, the arts are praised in the Agniṣṭoma.
25.11.25	"So that he does not injure himself from the vital airs."
25.12.1	And indeed, Prajapati is the Vishvajita.
25.12.2	Prajapati is indeed the Vishvajita of everything.
25.12.3	He who knows this attains everything by everything.
25.12.4	There, having chanted the Rudra for Agni and Maruts, he chants the Gayatri for the Maruts in the form of a Panka.
25.12.5	The sacrifice is fivefold; for the attainment of the sacrifice.
25.12.6	"He says, "Let me not transgress the art of the Adhvaryu."
25.12.7	Rudra is the eldest and best of the gods,
25.12.8	the most excessive of the metres,
25.12.9	the conqueror of all in the one-day (sacrifices).
25.12.10	He thus makes it complete with its own metre.
25.12.11	He makes it deficient in three (syllables).
25.12.12	If one were to make it a New Moon sacrifice,
25.12.13	one should make it a New-Moon sacrifice in all cases.
25.12.14	Food is the New Moon.
25.12.15	Food is life.
25.12.16	Life is the arts.
25.12.17	He thus places life in life.
25.12.18	And indeed, Prajapati, the All-Conqueror, generated all beings, conquered all.
25.12.19	He who performs the All-Conquering sacrifice becomes all this.
25.12.20	Therefore he makes it (the Soma) to be deficient.
25.12.21	The first pressing is like that which is deficient.
25.12.22	They generate him from the immortal metre for immortality.
25.12.23	Those who perform the Vīśvajit attain immortality.
25.12.24	The Agniṣṭoma comes to an end.
25.13.1	The Vīśva-jit is the one who performs the year-long Sattra.
25.13.2	The Agniṣṭoma is the foundation; it is for the sake of foundation.
25.13.3	If it is a one-day (rite), then the Viśvajit, or the Viṣuvaṇ of the night-long (rite), should be the Atiratra.
25.13.4	The Atiratra is the complete Viśvajit.
25.13.5	Half of the Viśva-jit is performed during the day,
25.13.6	and half during the night.
25.13.7	He who gives anything other than the entire wealth, or who performs a sacrifice other than the Sattra, is defeated in everything.
25.13.8	He who gives anything other that the entire wealth, is defeated in all.
25.13.9	He who, other than the Viśvajit, gives everything,
25.13.10	If it is the Viśva-jit, then everything.
25.13.11	If it is everything, then the Viśva jit.
25.13.12	He who says, "I do not give everything,"
25.13.13	It is indeed said, "One conquers or one is conquered."
25.13.14	"One should offer a thousand," said Kauṣītaki.
25.13.15	"A thousand" means everything.
25.13.16	"Everything" means the Viśvajit.
25.13.17	One who knows this obtains everything with everything.
25.13.18	One should offer a calf with a spotted skin.
25.13.19-25	The soul of one who gives everything away becomes like a calf. Cattle desire a calf. "May cattle desire me again." One should stay in an Udumbara tree. The Udumbara is food and nourishment. For the attainment of food and nourishment. One should stay in a fig tree.
25.14.7	He should live with a brahmin of the same gotra.
25.14.8	One should live with a person of the same gottra for the sake of obtaining food.
25.14.9	One should observe for one year, lying down below, accepting the food grown in the fields ploughed by oxen, not begging for food, and living in accordance with that.
25.14.10	One should follow that.
25.14.11	Having performed the twelve-night rite, one should desire another rite. So said Kauṣītaki.
25.14.12	Twelve months are a year.
25.14.13	That is the counterpart of the year.
25.14.14	The oblations of ghee for the Hotr priests are Prajapati's, unspecified.
25.14.15	His are the powers of the king, they yoke the tawny-coloured (horse) of the sun. They are always praised by him. Praise him who is in the light. The Stotriyas (say): "He who is in the rays."
25.14.16	Those who are the Stotriyas of the sixth day are the Anurupas of the Vishvajita.
25.14.17	The sixth day is indeed Prajapati.
25.14.18	Prajapati is the Vishvajita (winner of all).
25.14.19	The other five are the Uktha.
25.14.20	They put on the Pāryāsa-garments.
25.14.21	The Pāryāsas are indeed the foundation.
25.14.22	By means of the foundation, by means of the foundation.
26.1.1	The first month has thirty-two days, the last month also has thirty-two.
26.1.2	The Anushtubh has thirty-two syllables.
26.1.3	Anushtubh is speech.
26.1.4	They reach speech.
26.1.5	They stand in speech.
26.1.6	The two months around the equinox have twenty-eight days.
26.1.7	The Uṣṇīṣa has twenty-eight syllables.
26.1.8	The Uṣṇīsa is the neck.
26.1.9	Now this is the head of the sacrifice, namely, Viṣuva.
26.1.10	Having arranged it on the neck, they place the head on it.
26.1.11	They say, "On which of these days, the lower or the higher?"
26.1.12	They say, neither on the lower nor on the higher.
26.1.13	These are the days of both (the seasons).
26.1.14	These are the days of that (season).
26.1.15	They say, how many six-day periods are there in a year?
26.1.16	There are sixty six-day periods.
26.1.17	This is the year without interruption.
26.1.18	Those who yoke the days of the year in this way
26.1.19	Those who yoke the days of the year in this way, they attain all these desires.
26.1.20	But those who yoke the days in a different way than the year,
26.1.21	they do not attain all these desires as in the year.
26.2.1	Then indeed some yoke the months and days in the reverse order,
26.2.2	Those who say, "We ascend the year upwards."
26.2.3	Some say, "The months turn around, not the days."
26.2.4	Those who say, "The turning of the months is by that very same six-day week which is repeated afterwards."
26.2.5	They say, "The Trivṛt and Trayastriṃśa stomas are indeed far apart.
26.2.6	Just as a man might leap from the peak of a mountain, so is this Stomakrntatra.
26.2.7	Therefore, the days should be observed.
26.2.8	The months are not observed for the sake of Stomakrntatratā.
26.2.9	Now, the examination of the Goāyus.
26.2.10	One should approach after the Goāyūṣa has been completed.
26.2.11	The Goāyūsa is the day and night.
26.2.12	When these day and night have been completed, they are in each other.
26.2.13	Then indeed heaven and earth are the life of the cow.
26.2.14	When these heaven and earth are separated from each other,
26.2.15	Then indeed the out-breath and in-breath are the life of a cow.
26.2.16	When the out-breath is separated from the in-breath, they stand in each other.
26.2.17	They are indeed taken up in one above, to be taken up above, they are the life of cows.
26.2.18	The Stotras of the Anvābhiplava are repeated for ten days. Those who say that the Stotras of the Anuṣṭubh are repeated.
26.2.19	The second and third days are indeed the Goāyuṣī.
26.3.1	On the sixth day the gods would have attained the Stotras and the months.
26.3.3	Having obtained these Stomas, he composed the Stomas of the Prstha Stomas in pairs.
26.3.3	For from where would he have brought another Stoma?
26.3.4	These two Stomas, Trivrt and Pañcadaśa, having become the twenty-fourth Stoma, carried the seventh day.
26.3.5	Then these two, the seventeen and the twenty-seven, carrying the ninth day, become the forty-eight Stoma.
26.3.6	Then these two, the twenty-one and the thirty-three Stomas, carrying the ninth Day, become the forty eight Stoma.
26.3.7	Of them the first is measured by the Gāyatrī, the second by the Tristubh, the third by the Jagatī.
26.3.8	The hymns are measured by the metres.
26.3.9	Therefore they are called 'Chandomas'.
26.3.10	Now those six Stotriyas which exceed the forty-eight Stoma,
26.3.11	they are called the seasons.
26.3.12	The seasons are sixfold.
26.3.13	With them the tenth day is completed.
26.3.14	The sixth day is within.
26.4.4	The pure ones have gone forth to you, O Vīrya, with the wind-offering.
26.4.5	The wind-offering is indeed the form of the first day.
26.4.6	Therefore the next verse is the Indra-Vayu offering, "With your true mind, thinking."
26.4.7	"Carrying with your own yoke, with your own rite," is the yoked.
26.4.8	The yoked is indeed the form for the first day.
26.4.9	"May your eye, O Varuna, be well-directed." This is for the Maitrāvaruṇa.
26.4.10	"The god-like one goes to the sun, stretching himself." This is for one who stretches himself.
26.4.11	Stretching oneself is the form of the seventh day.
26.4.12	"O Nasatya, come to us with the divine power, O divine one, in the chariot, with the cattle. We who are devoted to the gods, desiring you, come to us, O divine one. You who are praised at sacrifices, come to us. You who are swift, come to us."
26.4.13	The Pravargya rite is the form of the Pravargya rite.
26.4.14	Therefore, the hymns of the Avani and Pravani are recited on the seventh day in the form of the Prayaṅgya rite.
26.4.15	For the seventh day is a repetition of the Prayaṇīya.
26.4.16	They say that whatever verse is to be used at the morning pressing, it should be chanted in half-verses. In the form of the Gāyatrī and in the form of the morning pressing.
26.4.17	Now, Kauṣītaki said this:
26.4.18	The Tristubh and Jagati should not be chanted in half verses at this place.
26.4.19	Even if they are to be used at morning pressing.
26.4.20	The weapon of these two is later on. This is the position.
26.4.21	The weapon of the Rathantara is the Brihat.
26.4.22	That is the form of the pair for procreation.
26.5.1	"The good, the same-aged, the same-nest ones." This is the Marutvatiya.
26.5.2	This is the hymn of fame with this name.
26.5.3	By this, indeed, Indra and the Maruts became united.
26.5.4	He who knows this attains the highest position.
26.5.5	"What is the meaning of these (verses) and from where do they come?" This is the Rathantara.
26.5.6	"The sheep, the great, the knower of heaven," this is the Jāgara.
26.5.7	"Indra, we have resorted to you in the morning with good prayers," this is the Rathantara
26.5.8	The Jāgara is in the Tristubh metre, the Jagat is in the Jāgara metre. The midday is indeed the third day.
26.5.9	They say, "The Rathantara is the Sāman of the seventh day. Why is the Brihat Sāman performed every day?"
26.5.10	These days are indeed the days of the Mahāstomas.
26.5.11	Therefore the Brihat Sāmā is performed every day.
26.5.12	For the strength of these days.
26.5.13	For the non-interruption of these Sāmans.
26.5.14	Having chanted the Brihat, he chants the Rathantara's birthplace.
26.5.15	"Kauṣītaki said, "Our father did not say this, that it was so and so."
26.5.16	Wherever these two Sāmans meet together in the same day,
26.5.17	there one should chant the birthplace of the other, of either one.
26.5.18	If they were to perform the Kānva-Rathantara,
26.5.19	One should not praise his (i.e. the sacrificer's) lineage.
26.5.20	For the lineages of other clans are not fruitful.
26.5.21	"Praise him who is the most powerful, the ram, the invoked, the one with the Rigveda." Both are the most powerful.
26.5.22	That is the form of Rathantara.
26.5.23	The Triṣṭubh and the Jāgara are the Jagat. The Jagat is the midday, for this is the midday of the three days.
26.5.24	Two verses each are recited in the two verses of the Niskekvalya and Marutvatīya hymns in the first Prastāra.
26.5.25	The sacrificer has two feet.
26.5.26	For stability.
26.5.27	They become four.
26.5.28	The Chandomas are animals.
26.5.29	Animals are of four kinds.
26.5.30	And animals have four feet. For the attainment of animals.
26.6.1	"The Savitri verse, "This is the most excellent of Savitar's rays,"
26.6.2	"May he who has inspired our thoughts, lead us forward."
26.6.3	The Pravaḍ is the form of the first day.
26.6.4	"May we go to the peaceful sacrifice." The Dyava-Pṛthivīya is the Pravaḍ.
26.6.5	The Pravaṭ is the form of first day.
26.6.6	This is for the birth of the god. The Ārbhava is the form of second day.
26.6.7	"The Stoma is placed with the Brahmins." The Āvaṭ is the third day.
26.6.8	The Āvaṭ is form of the first days.
26.6.9-15	"O Varuna, with the straight course." This is a Vaishvadev verse in the form of a Nita. The Nita is the form of the seventh day. "Come with the forest and the staff." This is a Dvipada verse in the form an Avat. The Avat is the form of first day. "Omasas, held by the leader of the people." This is a Vishvadev verse. "All the gods have come." This is an Avat. The Avat is the first form of the first day.
26.6.16	The Gayatri is the third pressing, for this is the three-day (rite).
26.6.17	"The verse, "Vaisvânara, the bestower of wealth," is the Vaisvânara (verse).
26.6.18	" "The verse, "May it come from the distance," is the Avat (verse).
26.6.19	" "The Avat is the form of the first day.
26.6.20	" "The Marut verse, "If you come with your Triṣṭubh food," is the Pravat (verse). The Pravat is the form
26.6.21	of the first day."
26.6.22	"We invoke you, O Jātavedas, while we worship you." This is the Jātavedasiya hymn.
26.6.23	"We spread out the sacrifice with you." This is a spreading out.
26.6.24	The spreading out is indeed the form of the seventh day.
26.6.25	The Gāyatrī is the Gāyatrī-third-pressing, for this is the three-day (rite).
26.6.26	Thus are the Agni-Marut hymns.
26.6.27	Thus are the hymns of this day.
26.6.28	It concludes with the Ukthya.
26.7.7-11	This is the highest day, beginning from which one should stay. Thus said Kausītaki. "Agniḥ vo devam agnibhiḥ sajoṣā" "Yada mahas samvaranāt vyasthāt" "Traiṣṭubhaḥ prāgaḥ" "Kuvid aṅga namasā ye vṛdhās" "Vāyavyam vṛddhavats"
26.7.12	This day is indeed great.
26.7.13	Therefore the next verse is for Indra-Vayu, "As many bodies, as much strength."
26.7.14	"As many men as with sight are looking," it is as if begun.
26.7.15	"To you both, O Sūrya, at sunrise, with hymns," is for Mitra-Varuna.
26.7.16	"I invoke Mitra, Varuna, of pure power," it is as begun.
26.7.17	"May the sun not be covered by your sister." This is the Ashvin verse.
26.7.18	"We invoke you, O Aśvamedha and Gomadha, who are engaged in the sacrifice." This is the verse for engaging in the sacrifice.
26.7.19	"This Soma is being pressed for you, O Indra." This is the Indra verse.
26.7.20	"O hero, O Brahman, enjoying the Brahmanic activity." This is the engaging verse.
26.7.21	"The Brahmans and Angiras are shining forth." This is the Visvedeva verse.
26.7.22	"The one who cries out, the one who is in the sky, may he hear us."
26.7.23	"May Sarasvati be pleased with us."
26.7.24	"Increase the good praise, give the horses."
26.7.25	This day is indeed great.
26.7.26	The Rathantara is the background, the Barhaspatya is the hymn.
26.7.27	That is the form of the pair for procreation.
26.8.1	The great Indra, like a man, the leader of troops, is the first of the Marutvatiya Stotras in the Trishtup metre.
26.8.2	It is like the great and the beginning.
26.8.3	These are thy praises, O Indra, of the most generous giver, is the second.
26.8.4	The hero is worthy of praise, the praiseworthy are praised, is like the beginning.
26.8.5	Where is the hero? Who has seen Indra? is the third.
26.8.6-9	The fourth verse is "O Indra, you are the great one, from whom these (rivers) flow." The fifth verse is "You are the great one who abandons, O Varuna." The sixth verse is "The heaven and earth are with him who has consciousness."
26.8.10	When he is doing the greatness, the power, of Indra, it is as if he has begun with something great.
26.8.11	In the Triṣṭubh and Jagatī meters, the Jagatī is in the middle, for this is the midday of the three days.
26.8.12	"Thou art great, O Indra, and the earth is thine." This is the first of the Triṣṭuṃbh verses, the exclusive ones.
26.8.13	It is as if he had begun with something great.
26.8.14	"Thou art the great Indra, O thou who art strong with thy strength." The second is like the great.

26.8.20	This is the fifth verse.
26.8.21	It is great, it is beginning with the word 'great'.
26.8.22	The Jagat metre is in the Triṣṭubh metre. The Jagat metre is the midday of the three days.
26.8.23	Five verses each are prescribed in the Niskevalya and Marutvatīya metres in the middle month.
26.8.24	The months are the animals.
26.8.25	Animals are of five kinds.
26.8.26	For the attainment of cattle.
26.8.27	They become ten.
26.8.28	The Viraj has ten tens.
26.8.29	The Viraja is prosperity, food.
26.8.30	For the attainment of prosperity and food.
26.9.1	"O Savitar, thou art the bestower of gold." This is Savitri.
26.9.2	"O Indra, thou art the giver of water." This is Mahdvat. It is begun with the word "abhyarbbdhavat."
26.9.3	The earth and heaven are the two. This is the Dyaus-Pritbvi (verse).

26.9.5	The young ones and the fathers again. This is the Arbhava (verse).
26.9.6	With Indra and Marutvatas. This is the Abhirabdhava (verse).
26.9.7	The great call of the gods. This is the Visvadeva (verse).
26.9.8	May Aryaman grant us the left, may Varuna grant us the left to be praised.
26.9.9	Which of these worlds do they support? (They are) two-footed.
26.9.10	Indra and the All-Gods.
26.9.11	The All-Gods, the Rta-enhancer. This is the Vaishvadevam (rite), for the elder.
26.9.12	This day is indeed great.
26.9.13	The Gayatri is the third pressing, for this is a three-day (rite).
26.9.14	"The verse, "Vaisvânara has generated," is for Vaisvânara."
26.9.15	"The verse "By the increase of the sky, by the strength," is for the one who has increased."
26.9.16	"The one who has increased, the great, the one who has begun."
26.9.17	"The Marut verse, "What is the good, what is the beloved?" is for the Maruts, the one who is beginning."
26.9.18	"The Jâtavedas verse, "Your messenger, the knower of all," is for Jâtavedasa."
26.9.19	"O Agni, thou art great and kind."
26.9.20	The hymn has eight verses, for the eighth day.
26.9.21	It is placed first.
26.9.22	"The great one is the covering of heaven," it is great, it is beginning with the great.
26.9.23	The Gāyatrī hymn, for this three-day period is connected with the Gāyatrī Sāman.
26.9.24	Thus are the hymns of Agni-Maruts.
26.9.25	Thus are these hymns of this day.
26.9.26	That Ukthya rite is concluded.
26.9.27	Its Sapti is the second day.
26.10.1	The ninth day is the end and the goal.
26.10.2	This is the heaven, this is the world.
26.10.3	Therefore, on the ninth day, the hymns are sung as having gone.
26.10.4	"We have come to the greatest, the most excellent, of Soma. O Agni, do not withhold your strength." These two are the oblations.
26.10.5	"It went" means "it went away".
26.10.6	That is the form of the end.
26.10.7	The ninth day is the end.
26.10.8	It seems to go to the end.
26.10.9	One should go from there.
26.10.10	"The cows are standing here, swelling," means "standing".
26.10.11	That is a form of the end
26.10.12	The ninth day being the end.
26.10.13	"It seems to stand at the end."
26.10.14	One should go there.
26.10.15	"We have reached the most excellent one with great reverence." This is the third verse. The ghee should be like this, says Pingya.
26.10.16	"Agam me" means "gone".
26.10.17	That is the last form.
26.10.18	The ninth day is the last.
26.10.19	One goes to the end as if going to the end.
26.10.20	One should go from there.
26.10.21	"How many verses does the Stoma of forty-eight consist of?" so said Kaushitaki.
26.11.1	One should praise it thus: "O Agni, I shall praise your Soma-drink."
26.11.2	Its concluding form is that which is stated in the verse: "We have performed the sacrifice facing the east, we have conquered the heaven."
26.11.3	This is as if it were the past.
26.11.4	Here, indeed, Paiṅgya said, "The Stoma should not be filled up."
26.11.5	If the Stoma is filled up only by the Rks.
26.11.6	The Stoma is filled by the syllables.
26.11.7	The Stomas are filled by the syllables or by the words or by the Nidhis or by the Puroravas.
26.11.8	The Stotra is filled up there where the Nidhis or the Puroravas are mentioned.
26.11.9	Therefore, it is indeed pervaded.
26.11.10	The third ladle should be made of ghee, as stated by Pingya.
26.11.11	But it is indeed established as both.
26.11.12	Indeed, on this day, Vasishtha and Vishvamitra became friends.
26.11.13	He who knows this indeed attains the best position.
26.11.14	Therefore, both should be used.

26.14.19	One goes beyond that.
26.14.20	The Gayatri (verse) is for the Gayatri-third-pressing, because this three-day (rite) is the Gayatri-pressing.
26.14.21	"He shines in heaven, being asked." This is the Vaishvantarī (verse).

26.14.44	The man stands above the cattle, the man stands above the animals.
27.1.1	"The tenth day is that which is above the heaven," so said Kausītaki.
27.1.2	Therefore it is not to be spoken.
27.1.3	No one knows that.
27.1.4	"He who does not know, should not speak."
27.1.5	This is the measure of the divine work, namely, the tenth day, and the Anushtubh verse.
27.1.6	He who speaks beyond that,
27.1.7	exceeds it.
27.1.8	The lord of speech is the one who speaks beyond. The fault is in the one who follows.
27.1.9	They say, "One should speak only what is known."
27.1.10	The sacrifice rejoices when it is approached by the learned.
27.1.11	"Whatever is not accomplished for me, he will accomplish for me."
27.1.12	If someone were to injure a person who is careless,
27.1.13	Whoever would study that,
27.1.14	Whoever would say that to him there,
27.1.15	He should study the recitation on the side of that place.
27.1.16	Or if a householder were to approach the Brahmins alone,
27.1.17	He should recite the recitation on the sides of that place.
27.2.1	If he does not think so,
27.2.2	he should speak to him.
27.2.3	It is released on the tenth day, in the Anushtubh metre.
27.2.4	Speech is Anushtubh.
27.2.5	It becomes harsh-carrying like the cow of the Vrata-doha.
27.2.6	Therefore it is released.
27.2.7	"So that we do not fall into speech."

27.2.13	They say, one should not abandon the abode of Anushtubh.
27.2.14	One should recite Viraj there.
27.2.15	The Viraj and the Anushtubh are the same in metre.
27.2.16	For no other metre is made up of one syllable,
27.2.17	or of two.
27.2.18	Of these two verses, the three verses have six syllables each.
27.2.19	In the Agni stoma of the Agni stoma, in the Stotriya and Anurudya, there are six.
27.2.20	Those twelve syllables.
27.3.1	The Hotṛ should complete the Prātaranuvāka.
27.3.2	One should not neglect it, as it is completed here itself.

27.3.9	One should not honour it as accomplished here itself.
27.3.10	The Prauga of Madhuccandasa, its Brāhmaṇa has been stated.
27.3.11	In the Trikadruka (sūktas) the Mahisha (sūkta) with the Atichandasa Marutvatīya begins with the verse, "The Mahisha with the barley-head, of great lustre."
27.3.12	It is accomplished with sixty-four syllables.
27.3.13	Those two become Anushtubh.
27.3.14	That is accomplished.
27.3.15	The two Prāgāthas are sung with the Apīyava metre. The two verses are: "Sing to Indra, the great one, and to the great Indra."
27.3.16	That is accomplished.
27.3.17	One-day Marutvatīya.
27.3.18	The one-day (rite) is indeed a foundation; it is indeed by means of the foundation.
27.4.1	What is our wonderful (verse)? What is thy (verse)? In the womb of Vamadevya, the Rathantara is borne, the Agniya Saman in the Indriyas.
27.4.2	That is the form of the pair for procreation.
27.4.3	As many as are the Pragathas, so many are the Ushnih-s and the Tristubhs.
27.4.4	One (verse) is divided into two feet.
27.4.5	Another (verse) is the seventeenth of the Sukta.
27.4.6	That is accomplished.
27.4.7	The Ekāhika is the Nishkevalya.
27.4.8	The Pratiṣṭhā is the tenth day.

27.4.11	It is complete with sixty-four syllables.
27.4.12	Those two Anushtubhas are complete.
27.4.13	That is accomplished.
27.4.14	The attendant Abhivan said to the Brahman.
27.4.15	Then the one-day Ekāhika is always the third pressing.
27.4.16	The one-day is indeed a foundation, by means of the foundation.
27.4.17	There, before the Anubadriya, he recites the Praśukriya.
27.4.18	The one day is indeed a foundation. The tenth day is a foundation.
27.4.19	The foundation is indeed the metre. The two-footed (verses) are indeed the foundation.
27.5.1	The Vamadevya is the Agniṣṭoma Sāman of Viraṭs.
27.5.2	Viraṭ is prosperity, food.
27.5.3	For the attainment of prosperity and food.
27.5.4	And the Vamadevya indeed is peace and healing.
27.5.5	This peace and healing is done at the end of the sacrifice.
27.5.6	And when they perform the excess Uktha of the combined (Sāmans),
27.5.7	Therefore they attain the Atiriktoktas.
27.5.8	Now this is the milking of the tenth day.
27.5.9	As there are one thousand and fifteen Anushtubh verses,
27.5.10	so one should complete this day.
27.5.11	Having subtracted fifteen from a hundred, he subtracts four from each hundred.
27.5.12	Those are forty.
27.5.13	The previous fifteen.
27.5.14	Those are the fifty-five extracted.
27.5.15	Now the other thirty-three groups.
27.5.16	Now this is the Anushtup verse.
27.5.17	Six verses for Gāyatrī, three for Uṣṇīh, three for Viśvarūpā, four for Bṛhatī, five for Paṅkti, making a total of twenty-eight.
27.5.18	Now the twenty-eight groups.
27.5.19	Now the thirty-three groups.
27.5.20	There are four Tristubhs, making twenty-two.
27.5.21	There are eight Jagatīs and Atichhandas, making thirty.
27.5.22	There are two Dvipadīs, making thirty-two.
27.5.23	Thus this is the Anushtubh of the Padas, consisting of thirty-one.
27.6.1	Now this is the Anustubh of the deities:
27.6.2	The Vasus are eight, the Rudras eleven, the Adityas twelve, Indra thirty-two; this is the divine Anushtubh, thirty-two.
27.6.3	Then those which are fifty-five.
27.6.4	They are forty-four rows.
27.6.5	Then those forty are the belly.
27.6.6	Then those four which go beyond are the breasts.
27.6.7	This is the Anushtubh metre of Stoma. With this, with these breasts, he flows the Vratya day, the Self of Indra.
27.6.8	He flows with all food, with all tastes, with all desires, with all immortality.
27.6.9	The Chandomas increase from this very flowing, from the Stoma and from the Sastra.
27.6.10	Whatever one knows, one becomes that.
27.6.11	He who knows this, after this life, attains the state of Indra, the day of the vow.
27.6.12	He is nourished by this Anushtubh verse, by this heaven, by these breasts, by all food, by all tastes, by all desires, by all immortality.
27.6.13	He who recites the tenth day in this way,
27.6.14	Therefore one should recite the tenth day in the way described.
27.7.1	Now when they perform the additional Stotras,
27.7.2	They please the mind.
27.7.3	All the sacrifices follow it.
27.7.4	This is the measure of the mind.
27.7.5	When the day is over, before the Patnīsaṃyājas, they move forward at this time.
27.7.6	The wives are not fit for sacrifice, because they are outside the altar.
27.7.7	But when the Patnisamyājas are concluded, it is indeed established.
27.7.8	Here the small world of enemies remains.
27.7.9	Having approached, they praise the Rks with the Sarparajniya.
27.7.10	This is indeed the Sarparajani.
27.7.11	This is the queen of serpents.
27.7.12	Now, indeed, the speech is the queen of the serpents.
27.7.13	Speech is the queen of serpents.
27.7.14	Now, indeed, the cow is the queen of snakes.
27.7.15	The cow is the queen among snakes.
27.7.16	"This cow, the speckled one, has come forth," one should not interrupt this verse, for uninterruptedness.
27.7.17	"May strength be in us."
27.7.18	Food is strength.
27.7.19	He places that food in the sacrifice and in the sacrificers.
27.8.1	He mentions himself first.
27.8.2	Thus he becomes hidden by himself.
27.8.3	The one who is heard to offer in the open air.
27.8.4	Indra is the one who is in the open air,
27.8.5	He, having obtained the wind, killed the body.
27.8.6	The Adhvaryu goes around.
27.8.7-13	He offers two oblations on the Garhapatya fire which is not specified. Prajapati is the Garhapaty. Prajapata is not specified. The praise and the benediction are concluded with the oblations. The praise is concluded, the benediction is concluded, the Brahma-utterance is concluded. Henceforth one may worship as one wishes. One may partake of the oblations.
27.8.14	This is indeed Vena, the son of Prajapati, who is the Hotri.
27.9.1	Annadi and Annapattni.
27.9.2	This is indeed Annadi and Annapati.
27.9.3	Bhadra and Kalyani.
27.9.4	Bhadra is indeed Soma.
27.9.5	Kalyani is indeed cattle.
27.9.6	Anilasa and Apbhaya.
27.9.7	Anilasi is indeed Vayu.
27.9.8	For he does not rest.
27.9.9	The death of that is not to be feared.
27.9.10	For he does not fear it.
27.9.11	The unapproachable and the unapproachable.
27.9.12	This is the unapproachable
27.9.13	The sky is the unapproached.
27.9.14	The unassailable and the unassailable.
27.9.15	This Agni is the unassailabe.
27.9.19	The year is the one without a brother.
27.9.20	He is the same householder who shines.
27.9.21	He is indeed the lord of houses.
27.9.22	His seasons are indeed houses.
27.9.23	He is the lord.
27.9.24	He is this god, free from sin.
27.9.25	The Adhvaryu runs forward.
27.9.26	They place the doors of the Sadas and the hall.
27.10.1	They begin with the Udumbara (wood).
27.10.2	The Udumbara is indeed the food.
27.10.3	For the attainment of food.
27.10.4	The Hotri should make the two hands the highest.
27.10.5	"For the highest is the hand."
27.10.6	He indeed becomes the highest.
27.10.7	They sat down restraining speech until the appearance of the stars.
27.10.8	Indeed, when they sit down restraining speech, then the beings are nourished by speech.
27.10.9	"May we obtain the speech of the Apas, which is not to be transgressed."
27.10.10	When the stars are visible, the uninitiated one, standing outside, says, "Are the initiated ones present?"
27.10.11	They extend the door of the assembly hall.
27.10.12	In the same way, for the hall.
27.10.13	They, having gone out as they had approached, and having released their sight in the Marjalyan direction and in the stars, that sight, being divine, bright, and pure, shines forth.
27.10.14	The stars are indeed light.
27.10.15	They place that light in themselves.
27.10.16	They approach the Havirdhana hall through the highest door.
27.10.17	Then the Adhvaryu, having approached the corner of the northern Havirdhāna, says, "Sing the Satrasarthi."
27.10.18	He sings the Satrasarathi.
27.10.19	They attain the Satrasaradhi.
27.10.20	All conclude with the Samans.
27.10.21	The conclusion is indeed a firm foundation; it is indeed through firm foundation.
27.10.22	They go to the northern Havirdhāna-shed, reciting the Atichandas verse of Indra, which is the lower one.
27.10.23	By means of the Atichandas they remove the lower sin.
27.11.1	Now, we indeed go to the northern Hāvirdhāna-shed. This was said by Kauṣītaki.
27.11.2	The seven sages are not far from the course of the sacrifice.
27.11.3	They sit down in front of the sacrificial grass and meditate on whatever desire they wish.
27.11.4	That desire is fulfilled for them.
27.11.5	Now those who have many desires
27.11.6	They recite these Vyāhṛtis: "Bhūḥ, Bhuvaḥ, Svaḥ."
27.11.7	Having stepped forward and upward, they utter a sound.
27.11.8	"Let not the speech be turned away from us."
27.11.9	They make the speech their own self.
27.11.10	They release speech with Subrahmaṇya.
27.11.11	Brahma is indeed Subrahmaṇyā.
27.11.12	They release the speech with Brahma itself.
27.11.13	They sit together with the Agnīdhra and the king.
27.11.14	It is as if they would lead a tired king or a prince to his house.
27.11.15	In the same way, they bring Soma, the king, to the Havirdhana sheds every day and then hand it over to the Agnidhra.
27.11.16	They sit together with the king in the Agnidhra shed.
27.11.17	Then when they perform the Dasara-rite,
27.11.18	it is for the attainment of all desires.
27.11.19	When they perform the Vyuha-rite,
27.11.20	For the attainment of all the metres.
27.11.21	Now, when they perform the Vyuha and Samūha sacrifices,
27.11.22	it is the diversity of the ten-night sacrifice.
27.11.23	The Samūha indeed was the first.
27.11.24	Those metres then occupied each other's place.
27.11.25	"All should be the foremost, all should be the middle, all should be supreme."
27.11.26	Now, indeed, they make all the metres to be used at all the pressing-ceremonies.
27.12.1	The first three days are of the Gayatri metre at the morning pressing, of the Tristubh metre at the midday pressing, and of the Jagati metre at the third pressing.
27.12.2	The second three days are of Jagati metre at morning pressing, of Gayatri metre at midday pressing, and Tristubh metre in the third pressing.
27.12.3	The morning pressing is in Tristubh metre, the midday pressing in Jagatī metre, the evening pressing in Gāyatrī metre.
27.12.4	The tenth day is in Gāyatrī metre.
27.12.5	They approach the same metre from the same metre.
27.12.6	And when he completes the tenth day in Anushtubh metre,
27.12.7	this day is speech.
27.12.8	Speech is Anushtubh.
28.1.5	These are the instructions and the statements.
28.1.6	Then the other sages performed the sacrifice.
28.1.7	They understood,
28.1.8	"We are performing the sacrifice with everything. We do not attain all desires."
28.1.9	They were afraid,
28.1.10	They saw these instructions and statements.
28.1.11	By means of that invocation and instruction, they obtained all their desires.
28.1.12	These are the only invocations and instructions.
28.1.13	"They thought, "Whatever is not obtained by the Rg verses, we shall obtain it all by these."
28.2.1	Visvamitra saw these invocations.
28.2.2	Then the Purorasa invocations.
28.2.3	And the other sages the other ones.
28.2.4	They say, why does the Maitrāvaruṇa alone send forth all (the Hotṛs)?
28.2.5	These indeed are the deities who have come to the race of sending forth.
28.2.6	Then Mitra and Varuna won it.
28.2.7	Therefore the Maitrāvaruņa alone sends forth all (the Hotr priests).
28.2.8	He sends forth standing.
28.2.9	Standing is the most vigorous.
28.2.10	Standing, he should recite the words of the unlearned, which are heard in darkness.
28.2.11	He should recite the words that are heard among the gods, which are courageous and truthful.
28.2.12	One should recite them as if bowing down with a crooked body.
28.2.13	Thus, indeed, the rain god becomes generous. So said Kaushitaki.
28.2.14	In ancient times, the Asuras and Rakshasas used to steal the offerings.
28.2.15	Then Vamadeva saw these beautiful (verses): "Agni, the Hotar, is our sacrifice."
28.2.16	With these (verses) they approached Agni.
28.2.17	Then indeed those Rakshas demons destroyed them.
28.2.18	"Accept the most excellent" - he recites the verse "Juṣṭavatī" (agreeable) in accordance with the beautiful (verse).
28.2.19	"Juṣṭavatīm (agreeable) beautiful speech among the gods" - he recitess.
28.2.20	"Place this our sacrifice among the immortal ones."
28.2.21	He makes Agni pleased with these (offerings) in a small way.
28.2.22	These are indeed their introductory verses and the verses to be recited at the time of offering.
28.2.23	Therefore they become similar.
28.3.1	He recites the introductory verse of the Visva-mitra cake, the Svishtakrit. The Brāhmaṇa text on it has been explained.
28.3.2	The Puronuvakya-s of the oblations to Visvamedha are to be recited in the order of their being offered.
28.3.3	Visvamitra saw these oblations to be offered to Visvamedhas.
28.3.4	The Puronuvakyas of the first oblations to two deities are to be recited as prescribed by Madhucchanda.
28.3.5	Madhucchanda saw these oblations for two deities.
28.3.6	He recites the Gartsamadi and the Medhatithi verses at the two northern (Saman) chants.
28.3.7	He recites the Medhatithi verse at the morning pressing when the Soma is being pressed.
28.3.8	Medhatithi had told Indra about the morning pressing.
28.3.9	They are the verses of the Avatya and Harivya families. They are recited in the Puronuvakya and Anuvakya.
28.3.10	They are Indra-related.
28.3.11	The sacrifice is related to Indra.
28.3.12	They are Gāyatrī verses.
28.3.13	The morning pressing is Gāyatrī.
28.3.14	They are recited nine times.
28.3.15	Nine cups are indeed taken up here.
28.3.16	Some recite six times when the cups are being taken up at the morning pressing.
28.3.17	The Svadhākāra recites the seventh.
28.3.18	There are seven at the two pressings which are seven in number.
28.3.19	Those who say that the seven priests seated facing east pronounce the Vasat call.
28.3.20	One should recite them as they are in the Sūkta.
28.3.19	For these are the Hotr's introductory verses.
28.3.22	For the Hotr alone they pour the Anucamasas and these cups.
28.3.23	Then they join the Hotr' s verses.
28.3.24	They release the sacrificer from debt.
28.3.25	"We call you, O Mitra," (with these words) the Maitrāvaruṇa (priest) recites the Maitrāvaruṇī verse. The Maitrāvaruṇa himself recites his own verse.
28.3.26	"The mouth of the sacrifice is not to be obstructed."
28.3.27	"O Indra, we call you, the bull," (with these) the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin recites the Āindra verse.
28.3.28	The sacrifice is indeed Indra.
28.3.29	"To him whose is the Maruts," (with these), the Pota recites the Mārutika verse.
28.3.30	Where the Maruts approached Indra.
28.3.31	Indra then joined them at the Soma-drinking.
28.3.32	Therefore the Marutya priest offers first and last.
28.3.33	"O Agni, bring here your wives!" (is recited) because of Agni's wives. The Nestr is connected with Tvashtri.
28.3.34	Tvashtri is the Nestr of the gods, connected with their wives.
28.3.35	Therefore he offers to Agni and Patnivatya and Tvashtrimatya first and last.
28.3.36	The Agnidhra offers to Agni, the nourisher, the lord of food.
28.3.37	For he kindles Agni.
28.3.38	Therefore he offers to Agni first and last.
28.4.1	Now when that man, the son of Angiras, was at the navel, he called for the offering.
28.4.2	He proclaimed that office of the Hotri to him.
28.4.3	He came when the Ida had been invoked.
28.4.4	Therefore they do not offer it.
28.4.5	He came from the intermediate region east of that.
28.4.6	Therefore, sitting in this direction, the Acchāvāka desires the invocation.
28.4.7	They say, why do they remove the rice-cake for the Acchāvaaka?
28.4.8	Vācaspati of Alika-yu was the Brahman of the Naimisha foresters at the initiation and concluding rites.
28.4.9	He performed the Acchāvakīya rite when he was old.
28.4.10	They said:
28.4.11	To him they used to offer this Brahma-share in olden times.
28.4.12	"Why do we offer it to him?"
28.4.13	They said, "To him alone do we offer it."
28.4.14	They offered it to him.
28.4.15	This is the Brahma-share.
28.4.16	The other cups are the shares of Ida.
28.4.17	Therefore they offer the rice-cake for the Acchāvāka.
28.4.18	for the sake of the exclusion of the cup.
28.5.1	Then the Adhvaryu says to him, "O Acchavaka, speak what you have to say."
28.5.2	He says to him, indeed, "May I be invited by the Acchavaka."
28.5.3	"We desire Agni at our house," says the Acchavaka. The Acchavaka recites the Agniya verses.
28.5.4	The Agniya verses are recited at the morning pressing.
28.5.5	They are in the Anushtubh metre.
28.5.6	The Gāyatrī is the Anushtubh.
28.5.7	The Gāyatrī metre is Agni's.
28.5.8	There are three of them.
28.5.9	Agni has three parts: embers, flame, and smoke.
28.5.10	In the third utterance at the end, he connects the recitation with the Pranava.
28.5.11	"O Yajamāna, O Hotṛ, O Adhvaryu, O Agnīdh, O Brahman, O Pitṛ, O Neṣṭr, and O Upāṃśu."
28.5.12	The teacher or the reciter.
28.5.13	Or, what is mentioned in the Veda.
28.5.14	The reciter of the people.
28.5.15	You all should seek prosperity and victory.
28.5.16	Food is prosperity and food is strength.
28.5.17	He says to them, "You all should seek food."
28.5.18	May your enemies be destroyed, may your non-enemies be destroyed.
28.5.19	What is born and what is unborn.
28.5.20	He says this to them, "You have been defeated."
28.5.21	Or with a verse:
28.5.22	"Destroy the born and unborn enemies."
28.5.23	"The enemies are defeated, bound, and destroyed."
28.5.24	He says this, "Your enemies have been defeated and destroyed."
28.5.25	"You conquer the one who is in front, you conquer the one who stands behind."
28.5.26	The army is the one who is before.
28.5.27	He says this, "One conquers the army with the army."
28.5.28	"May Indra hear, may Agni hear."
28.5.29	He says this as a blessing, "May Indra hear, May Agni hear."
28.5.30	When the Soma is being taken to the Iḍā and Anvāhārya portions, the Brahmanas call out, "O Brahmanas, do you call us."
28.5.31	He desires to be called by all.
28.5.32	The Hotṛ calls him.
28.5.33	For he becomes the chief of them.
28.5.34	He who is called by the chief,
28.5.35	he is called.
28.6.1	"May he be satisfied with us!" says the Adhvaryu when the Soma is being poured down.
28.6.2	They are four in number.
28.6.3	This universe is fourfold.
28.6.4	For the attainment of this entire universe.
28.6.5	He recites the verses addressed to Indra.
28.6.6	The sacrifice is indeed related to Indra.
28.6.7	They are Anushtubh verses for the purpose of praise.
28.6.8	The last one is Brihatī.
28.6.9	Brihatī is indeed prosperity.
28.6.10	It is indeed at the end of Śrī that one finds stability.
28.6.11	He offers the Prātar yāva-bhi-s with the Aindra-Agni-s.
28.6.12	For this is the Agni-Indra-saman of his Uktha.
28.6.13	The morning pressing is in the Gāyatrī metre.
28.6.14	He makes the Anuvṣaṭkāra for the sake of the peace of the offerings.
28.6.15	For the sake of the stability of the offerings.
28.6.16	They should offer at the morning pressing without the Anuvāka, says Pingya.
28.6.17	"Quickly we offer oblation to the gods."
28.6.18	"Half-verse-wise," says Kaushitaki.
28.6.19	"This is the festival of the metres, namely, the half-verse."
28.6.20	"He offers oblation to the Gods at the festival."
28.6.21	Now, the discussion of the seasonal invocations.
28.6.22	Kanva saw these Rtu-prayas.
28.6.23	Medhatithi saw the Yajyas.
28.6.24	Kanva was Medhatithi.
28.6.25	They both sought to overcome death and sin.
28.6.26	He who wishes to overcome death and evil,
28.6.27	should offer these sacrifices.
28.6.28	The sacrifice is man.
28.6.29	His speech is the ghee.
28.6.30	She is indeed one alone.
28.6.31	Therefore, one offers oblation to a single deity.
28.6.32	The Prāga is the vital airs.
28.6.33	These vital airs are indeed many.
28.6.34	Therefore, many deities are offered in the Prāga.
28.7.1	The Maitrāvaruṇa and the Acchāvāka are the arms.
28.7.2	They are indeed twofold.
28.7.3	Therefore, they offer oblations to two deities at the morning pressing.
28.7.4	This is the same as the Vena, the Sevani, and the Madhyandina Brahmanas.
28.7.5	Therefore the Brahmanaschansi recites the single-deity hymns at the morning pressing.
28.7.6	The self is the midday.
28.7.7	It is indeed one.
28.7.8	Therefore the Hotraschanasins recite the single-deities at midday.
28.7.9	The Hotri and the Niskavalyas.
28.7.10	The Maitravaruni and the Urus and the Acchhavasas.
28.7.11	They become two-fold.
28.7.12	Therefore, they chant the two-deity hymns at the third pressing.
28.7.13	The Brahmana-chanter's penis is in the middle.
28.7.14	Therefore, a person is born with two forms, a woman and a man.
28.7.15	Therefore, the Brahmana-chanter chants the two-deities hymns at the third offering.
28.7.16	The Brahmanas-chanters chant the most.
28.7.17	The Brahman-priest is in the middle.
28.7.18	Therefore this is the largest part of the self.
28.8.1	Now when the Stotriya hymns are in the middle, that is the form of the first day.
28.8.2	The Stotriya hymns of the Maitrāvaruṇa and the Acchāvāka are of the Vaisvānara and the Maitravaruna.
28.8.3	The Stotrīyas of the Vasishtha and the Navarchas are of the Vasishthas and the Navarchis.
28.8.4	They make the ends similar.
28.8.5	Having praised the Stotriyas, they perform the Anurupas.
28.8.6	For the continuity of the Ahina and for the form of the Ahina.
28.8.7	They perform the Anurupa of that day on that day itself.
28.8.8	The day is the Anurupa for the day.
28.8.9	They say, "Why is the praised one praised? Why do they praise the Stoma?"
28.8.10	That is not praised which is not commended.
28.8.11	That Stoma does not go to the gods which they do not commend.
28.8.12	Therefore, what is praised is commended, and therefore they commend the Stoma.
28.8.13	The Sastras are four-day-long.
28.8.14	The Ukthas are cattle.
28.8.15	Cattle are fourfold.
28.8.16	And cattle have four feet. For the attainment of cattle.
29.1.3	The Gravastomriya is the only Hotr that is not performed.
29.1.4	"I shall perform it for you; call me."
29.1.5	They said, "So be it."
29.1.6	They called him.
29.1.7	He saw these Gravastomriya hymns.
29.1.8	"Let them speak first; we shall speak afterwards."
29.1.9	When they speak first, he speaks afterwards.
29.1.10	Now, where it is said, "Great, great,"
29.1.11	they say, "Great, with the intoxicating drink, to the intoxicated one." There.
29.1.12	"Release from all sides" - when releasing.
29.1.13	They become fourteen in number.
29.1.14	There are ten fingers and four stones.
29.1.15	They come together in that very way.
29.1.16	They become in the Jagati metre.
29.1.17	The stones are in the Jagati (metre).
29.1.18	Now, when he lays down with the Tristubh (verse),
29.1.16	they become Jagatī (verses).
29.1.17	The stones are indeed Jagatī (in character).
29.1.18	Now, when he lays them down with the Tristup (verse),
29.1.19	then at midday the Tristup is attained.
29.1.20	He praises while standing.
29.1.21	The stones are as it were standing.
29.1.22	He praised while wearing a turban and with his eyes covered.
29.1.23	Therefore, even now, he praises the Gravas with the Ushnisha.
29.1.24	Now, they say:
29.1.25	"That serpent was indeed the eye-stealer.
29.1.26	The priests went to the poison.
29.1.27	He praised these Pavamani verses for removing poison.
29.1.28	In that he praises the Pavamani verses for the removal of poison,
29.1.29	For the peace of the sacrifice.
29.1.30	And for the healing of the sacrificer.
29.2.1	Then they perform with the Dadhigraha rite, after the praise and Pavamana. The Brāhmaṇa text of that is known.
29.2.2	Then they proceed with the Havishpankti rite. The Brāhmanical text of that is also known.
29.2.3	When the Vasishthi hymns are being recited at midday, one should recite:
29.2.4	Vasishtha, at midday, spoke to Indra about Soma.
29.2.5	They are the Avatya and Harivya verses, in the form of the Puronuvakya.
29.2.6	They are the Indraya and Tristubh verses.
29.2.7	For the Madhyamdina Savana is Indra and Tristubh.
29.2.8	They are recited ten times.
29.2.9	For ten cups are taken up here.
29.2.10	Then they join the Hotras. The Brāhmaṇa concerning them has been explained.
29.2.11-15	At midday, they offer with verses in the Indra-tristiib metre, to those who have set out. For the midday pressing is connected with Indra and the Tristubh metre. They perform the Anuvshada rite for the sake of peace of the offerings. For the establishment of the offerings. Then comes the Hotr's goblet. Its Brāhmaṇa is known.
29.3.4	The Naudhasam is for the Brahmanasamhita.
29.3.5	It is indeed the final one.
29.3.6	The final one is the foundation; it is indeed for the foundation.
29.3.7	This is the time for the Acchhavasa.
29.3.8	They make the Ida in the Brihatis.
29.3.9	The Ida is cattle;
29.3.10	the Brihatis are cattle.
29.3.11	Cattle are in the Brihat; it is for the attainment of cattle.
29.3.12	Then they chant the Sāman-prose.
29.3.13	Thus it becomes irregular for the Hotṛ.
29.3.14	The Maitrāvaruṇa and the Acchāvāka chant five verses at the beginning of the Uktha.
29.3.15	The Pratiprasthātṛ and the Maitrāvaruṇa chant eleven verses.
29.3.16	They make the two ends similar.
29.3.17	The Maiträvaruṇa chants the verses of Viśvāmitra and Vāmadeva.
29.3.22	For this is the turn of Visvamitra.
29.3.23	They praise him in the four verses of the four sages.
29.3.24	The four are a pair, a couple, for procreation, for propagation.
29.3.25	The verses of Visvamitra and Maitravaruna are at the beginning of the Brahmanacchansins.
29.3.26	The turn of the Acchavaka.
29.3.27	Visvamitra is speech.
29.3.28	The Brahmanical text is: "They make the sacrifice complete by means of speech."
29.4.1	There is a single day for the Pravargya and Udayaniya rites.
29.4.2	The Vamadevya is the Aharaha (daily) hymn of the Maitravaruna.
29.4.3	The Vāmadevya is peace and medicine.
29.4.4	This peace and medicine is performed daily in the sacrifice.
29.4.5	Now they sing the Prastara verses of the Kava (sutra) on each day.
29.4.6	Who is Prajapati?
29.4.7	They proceed towards Prajapati on that day.
29.4.8	And they proceed with the verses of the Ahina (sutra) which are not the same, and which are not the other, and which are used in different ways.
29.4.9	They go on, each day, appeasing the days with these same verses, which are in the Kava mode.
29.4.10	And these verses in the Tantri mode, which are in Triṣṭubh, are sung on each day.
29.4.11	The Triṣṭubha metre is strength and energy.
29.4.12	They go on, each da, standing firm in strength and energy.
29.4.13	"O Indra, drive away all the foes from the east." The Maitrāvaruṇa recites this verse for the removal of sin.
29.4.14	What is in the Ārsheya hymn is in the Āṛṣeya Utkha-mukhiya.
29.4.15	"With the Brahman, I yoke thee, yoked with the Brahman. Thou knowest, lead us to a large world." These are Brahman-related and large-related verses.
29.4.16	And in the Brahman and in the Urgaya, they go, standing at each day.
29.5.1	Now these arts are praised on the middle three days.
29.5.2	For this is the middle three days, and he who is skilled in arts.
29.5.3	And Viraj and Vaimdy on the fourth day.
29.5.4	For the fourth day is Viraj.
29.5.5-10	The Paṅktis and Mahāpaṅktis are on the fifth day. The Paṅktis are the fifth day. The Ati-Paṅktis are the sixth day. The Atipaṅktis and the Mahāpaṅ- ktis are on sixth day. The Atipaṅk tis are the sixth day. Now, that which is done apart from the Brihatī is indeed the Apṛṣṭha. The Pṛṣṭhas are indeed the Brihatī.
29.5.11	They proceed in the same order as the arts.
29.5.12	And this is the middle three-day period, the atmosphere.
29.5.13	The atmosphere is indeed without beginning and without end.
29.5.14	They proceed in the same way as the arts. They proceed in the arts.
29.5.15	They are the three verses.
29.5.16	The three-fold art is dancing, singing and playing.
29.5.17	They go to that very day, day after day.

29.5.20	Śrī is one-footed.
29.5.21	Śrī is the Brihatī.
29.5.22	They go to Śrī at the end, having attained stability.
29.6.1	Having chanted the two-footed verses, they chant the one-day verses.
29.6.2	The one-day is stability, the tenth day is stability.
29.6.3	The metre to be attained is stability, the two-footed are stability.
29.6.4	The Naudhasa is for the Brahman-reciters. Its Brāhmaṇa has been explained.

29.7.10	That is indeed the only defined (day) here.
29.7.11	Prajapati indeed is one.
29.7.12	That is Prajapati's form.
29.7.13	It consists of ten verses.
29.7.14	There are ten vital airs.
29.7.15	He thus places the vital airs in the sacrifices and in the sacrificers.
29.7.16	The Hotr-priests are mentioned twice, in the middle of the day.
29.7.17	For the support of the Hotr-priest who is mentioned twice.
29.7.18	And the year indeed is the Hotr-priesthood.
29.7.19	The seasons are the Hotr-aspirants.
29.7.20	And that the seasons are mentioned in pairs, as the summer, the rains, and the winter.
29.7.21	Therefore, the Hotrāshansins are the middle ones among the Hotrās.
29.7.22	And indeed, the Hotr is the Self.
29.7.23	The Hotrāshins are the limbs.
29.7.24	And because the limbs are doubled,
29.7.25	Therefore, the Hotrās are the middle ones.
29.8.1	Having chanted the Stoma-tisamst at the morning Savanas, they chant the Ahina-sooktas at the midday Savanas, on the twenty-fourth day, on the Abhijit, on the Visuvat, on the Brihat-pashta, on the Vishvajit, on the Mahavrata day.
29.8.2	For these days are indeed Ahina.
29.8.3	And why they chant the Ahinasooktas at the mid-day Savanas,
29.8.4	These days are the last ones of the year, turning back.
29.8.5	So that they do not go away.
29.8.6	Having recited the verses of the Ahina, they put on the one-day (rite).

30.2.1	Some say that they should be recited without omission, saying that they are to be recited at the Stomas.
30.2.2	But it is settled that they are different.
30.2.3	For they recite different verses on different days.
30.2.4	Then they recite the Varuṇa, the Brhaspati, and the Viṣṇu verses.
30.2.5	The Jagatī is the metre of these (verses), the Tristubh of Indra.
30.2.6	Therefore, when the metres are inverted, it is for the two-deity verses.
30.2.7	They recite the Indra-Varuṇa, the Indra-Brhaspati, and Indra-Viṣṇu verses,
30.2.8	They recite the Grahas in accordance with these (verses).

30.3.3	Then they perform the rites of Gūrdha, Bhadra, and Udvaṃśa.
30.3.4	Then the rites of two-footed animals are performed together.

30.3.15	He thus joins them.
30.3.16	Each verse in the third (verse).
30.3.17	He thus gathers him completely.

30.3.20	One ascends the Tarksya (verse) in the Dūrohaṇa (verse).
30.3.21	Tarksya is Vayu.
30.3.22	Vayu is Prāṇa.

30.4.1	He gives it to the Brahman-priest.
30.4.2	He receives it in the form of good fame.
30.4.3	Then he recites this verse to the Vrsakapi-priest.
30.4.3	The Pankti has five feet.
30.4.5	The sacrifice is fivefold. For the attainment of the sacrifice.
30.4.6	He recites with a low voice.

30.4.11	The Narashansi, the Raibhas, the Karavyas, the Indragathas, the Bhutechdas, the Parikshitas, the Etashaprajapam.
30.4.12	Indeed, the sage Etasha saw the life of the sacrifice.
30.4.13	He said to his sons:
30.4.14	"O sons, I have seen the life of the Yajna. I shall recite it.
30.4.15	"Do not be angry with me, O Dṛpta."
30.4.16	They said, "So be it."
30.4.17	He then lamented.
30.4.18	His eldest son approached and seized him by the mouth.
30.4.19	"You have been angry with our father."
30.4.20	He said to him,
30.4.21	"Go away, you fool! I curse you.
30.4.22	I will make your offspring the most sinful.
30.4.23	If you had not taken me, the one with a fierce face,
30.4.24	I would have made the cow live for a hundred years and the man for a thousand years.
30.4.25	Therefore, the sons of Aitashana, though they are learned, are the worst among the Bhrigus, cursed by their father, by their own deity, and by their own Prajapati.
30.5.1	He praises the Angirasas of the Adityas.
30.5.2	The Adityas and the Angiras were competing.

30.5.5	The Angiras despised the Adityas.
30.5.6	"They said, "Tomorrow you will perform the Sutiya sacrifice for us!"

30.5.8	The Adityas then said,
30.5.9	"Now it is our turn for the Sutiya."
30.5.16	Then the Adityas went to heaven.
30.5.19	He who knows this goes to heaven.

30.5.22	(He recitates) the Pravalhika, the Pratirādha, the Atividā, and all the words.
30.5.23	Therefore a man speaks all words.
30.5.23	Each of the others is a beast.
30.5.25	They are eight in number.
30.5.26	By means of these the gods attained all the eightfold worlds.
30.5.27	In the same way the sacrificers attain all the eightfold world by means of these.
30.5.28	"The two one-pawed ones (are recited) with the verses, "The Kaprnaras have placed the Kaprth, whatever has gone eastwards."

30.6.6	Those who attain the sixth day attain immortality.
30.6.7	Having chanted the Stotriya and Anurūpa, he recites the Vālakhilyas.
30.6.8	The Atman is the Stotriya and Anurupya.
30.6.9	The vital airs are the Valakhilyas.
30.6.10	The vital breaths are not separate from the Atman.
30.6.11	They say, why are they called Valakhilyas?
30.6.12	Because what is not separate from the two Urvaras.
30.6.13	They call it Valakhilyas,
30.6.14	Because these vital breaths are not separated from the Valas.
30.6.15	Because they are not separated,
30.6.16	Therefore, the Valakhilyas.
30.6.17	In the Tarksya (Sutra) it is said, "Durohanam rohati" (the one who ascends the sky).
30.6.18	In the Gayatri verses, they offer to the Brahmacchamsin priest on the second day.
30.6.19	By that, one comes under the control of the Maitravaruna priest.
30.6.20	"To the most generous, to the great, to the great one" - this is the Jagata (Sutra) with six verses. Its Brahmana has been explained.
30.6.21	Twice as much as the Maitrāvaruṇa.
30.6.22	The day is black, the day is black.
30.6.23	Kṛṣṇa Āṅgirasa saw the third pressing for the Brāhmaṇācchamsin.
30.6.24	Therefore the day is black, black.
30.7.1	They offer the Uṣṇīṣa to the Acchāvāka on the first day.
30.7.2	Therefore, he becomes subservient to the Brahmanaschasin.
30.7.3	The Rtu-janitriya is the thirteen-verse hymn. Its Brāhmaṇa has been explained.
30.7.4	Twice as much as the Brahmanaschasi and one more.
30.7.5	Bharadvaja says that the day is a series of repetitions.
30.7.6	Bharadwaja saw this as the third pressing for the Acchhavasaka.
30.7.7	Therefore the Bhardvaja priest has a daily change.
30.7.8	The Acchāvāka priest changes in the Vaiṣṇava (rite).
30.7.9	The other two have a change.
30.7.10	The Maitrāvaruṇa and the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin have a double change.
30.7.11	The Acchavasaka has a single change.
30.7.12	That the Acchāvākas has an unchanging change,
30.7.13	The Acchäväka is indeed a firm foundation. By means of the firm foundation.
30.7.14-21	The Maitrāvaruṇa recites twenty-six verses. The Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin recites forty verses. The Acchāvāka recites forty-four verses. That makes two hundred verses. The Rtu has twenty-hundred verses. They attain the Rtu. The year is attained by the Rtu. The desires that are in the year.

30.9.4	The night is five days.
30.9.5	The Atiriktoktā (extra recitation) of Vājapeya.
30.9.6	The Atigraha (extra recitation) is the night.
30.9.7-11	"They call him by the name of Chanda, so says Ajāmitāyai of Kauṣītaki. And when he recites the Triṣṭubh verse of the Aśvin graha, which is beyond the day, as the Puronuvākyā, the injunction is beyond the day. For the Soma offerings are beyond the day. And the Triṣṭup is strength, valour.
30.9.12	That very strength is the power of the sacrificer.
30.9.13	The additional Ukthas of the Aptoiryamas are performed on the fourth day.
30.9.14	The Ukthas are indeed animals.
30.9.15	Animals are of four kinds.
30.9.16	And animals have four feet. For the attainment of animals.
30.9.17	The Paridhananiyas are performed by the Kshetrapatis.
30.9.18	This earth is the field.
30.9.19	"In this (Soma) which is not distressed, they will at least find a resting place."
30.9.20	They indeed find a resting place in this (Soma) alone which is not distressed.
30.9.21	Now when the Yajyas are Triṣṭubh verses which are hidden from view,
30.9.22	it is because the Somas are hidden from view.
30.9.23	And the Trishtup is indeed strength and vigour.
30.9.24	He thus places strength and vigour in the sacrificer.
30.9.25-29	They perform the Anuvṣat-recitation for the sake of the peace of the offerings. For the establishment of the offerings. Then they proceed with the Hāriyojana. Its Brāhmaṇa is known. He recites the Puronuvākyā of the Hāri yojana in Tristubh metre. Its Brāhamaṇa is known. Then he recites the Puronovākyā of Atipraiṣa. What is the purpose of reciting the Puronuvākya of Atipraișa?
30.9.30	The Puronuvākyā is the one that is not recited before the call.
30.9.31	And in the case of the two-deity sacrifices, the Puronuvākyatī is recited.
30.9.32	And in all the cases where the sacrifice is undertaken.
30.9.33	Therefore he recites the Puronuvākya.
30.9.34	And when he recites the Atipraisa,
30.9.35	he proclaims the next day.
30.9.36	"This is the highest day on which one should begin to live." So said Kauṣītaki.

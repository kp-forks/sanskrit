1.10.24	He should say, "Soma's." For Brahmanas are the kings of Soma.
1.10.25	When the Adhvaryu takes the Agrayan cup, he causes injury. Then they should choose (the priests). Agni is the Prastotar, I am the human; Brihaspati is the Udgatar, I am the man; Vayu is the Pratihartar, I am the person.

2.12.15	The Dadhi-eating ending in the Ahina.
2.12.16	As many days as the king would eat, so many days they would not give the leftovers to their own Brahmins. They would either sprinkle it with water or give it.
2.12.17	This is the verse: "You drink this Soma, whatever you have eaten, O Brahmins. Let the leftovers not be given to a Brahmin. Soma to one who does not drink Soma."
2.12.18	Thus one should know in all the sacrifices.
3.1.1	While reciting the sixteen-fold Sāman, one should sit in the proper place and go to the Havirdhāna hall and look at the sixteen-fold Graha. The Udgātṛ should know that it is different from the others.

3.1.19	The cup is in the Anushtubh metre.
3.1.20	Or with the eastern one.
3.1.21	Thus acting, Indra and Samrāṭ Varuna became the king of Varuna. They made you the first to eat. Thus I shall eat after them. May the speech be pleased with the Soma. May the Soma be satisfied. This is the Graha.

3.2.13	Here, having said, "O Pitrs, may you be pleased according to your share," one should turn back and recite as long as one thinks, "The Pitrs are drinking according to their share, the Pitrs are not obstructed from the Soma libation."
3.2.14	Those darbha grass and drops should be struck in the southern fire.
3.3.1	Having put on the sacrificial thread, having sipped water, going to the house, he should recite: "May the houses not be afraid, may they not tremble. Bearing strength, may I be thus.

4.9.22	In the place of the first and the best, Vāravantiya and Yajñāyajñiya, says Lāmakāyana.
4.9.23	In the former Kalpa, Bhūyāṃsi, says Dhānajāpya.
4.10.1	One should recite "Mantiṣyat svāraṇī" and "Ālabhyāraṇyoḥ" at the time of churning.

4.10.5	When the fire is being deposited, one should recite, "The vow of cows, what is offered to Agni."
4.10.6	One should recite those verses that the Adhvaryu would recite.
4.10.7	It is heard that the Udgātṛkarmā is the sole Udgātṛ according to the Samaveda.
4.10.8	Like the verses of Vihavyasajaniya and Yashubhiyas for the Hotṛ,
4.10.9	and the verses of Viraj and Shakvar for the Prastôtṛ,
4.10.10	And because all the performers of the Brahma-character are not mentioned.
4.10.11	And because the four officiating priests, the Udgātṛ and others, eat at the Karma-yoga, it is called Catur-prasya-prasan.
4.10.12	But the Brāhmaṇas are entitled to it.
4.10.13	Because the Udgātā is not mentioned.
4.10.14	Because the chanting of the Sāman is seen in the Vājapeya and Sautrāmaṇi.
4.10.15	The Udgātṛ is mentioned as the most important.
4.10.16	The Hotr's duties are the Vihavya and others.
4.10.17	The Prastara is like the Stotra.
4.10.18	There is sprinkling with the Virata ladle, as there is sprinkling with the ladle filled with clarified butter, because of the statement in many places.
4.10.19	There is no injunction, because of the twofold nature of injunctions.
4.10.20	The connection with the rite is until the words are completed.
4.10.21	When the full oblation is offered, it should be as per the meaning.
4.10.22	If the dice are thrown, one should go there and sit silently.
4.10.23	They should play the game according to the rules.
4.10.24	In all sacrifices beginning with the Iṣṭi, one should sit with the Yajus.
4.10.25	In front of the sacrificer.
4.10.26	Towards the Āhavanīya.
4.10.27	At the junction of the two sacrificial posts, or at the place where the ladles are kept, or at the heap of sacrificial grass.
4.10.28	Between that and the Ahavaniya, the sacrificer moves, not others.
4.10.29	When the Adhvaryu says, "O Brahman, I am going to do this," then he should say, "May Savitr bless you. May the earth, the atmosphere, and the heaven be auspicious. May Brihaspati be the Brahman. I am human. Om." One should not recite these (verses) in sequence.
4.11.1	He should restrain his speech until the offering of the oblations is completed.
4.11.2	When the oblations are being offered, he should offer the Adhvaryu and the Bahvṛca priests, and the Adhvaryus and the Adhvarus.
4.11.3	Where the Adhvaryupast and the Bahvricupast perform, or where they do not perform, he should be silent.
4.11.4	If an expiation is to be performed, one should offer oblations with the formula, "To earth svāhā" in the Garhapatya fire, with the formula, “To earth and heaven svāhā” in the Dakṣiṇāgni fire, and with the formula, "To heaven svāhā" at the Āgnīdhra fire. If it is a Sutyā (rite), one should offer oblation with the formula, "To heaven, earth, and heaven svāha" in the Āhavanīya fire.
4.11.5	Having offered, one should say, "We have performed the expiation."
4.11.6	If he speaks at the wrong time, or if he commits a sin, he should recite these same verses. "This is Vishnu" is the verse for prosperity.
4.11.7	At the new moon, they should cleanse the milking utensils with the Aphiṣṭhyā verses.
4.11.8	If that is not available, then with darbha grass.
4.11.9	All the offerings, says Śāṇḍilyāyana.
4.11.10	When the food is being brought, one should say, "I see you with the eye of Mitra."
4.11.11	Having sipped water, one should receive it, saying, "For the god."
4.11.12	Having arranged the grass in front, one should place the staff, saying, "I place you in the navel of the earth."
4.11.13	Having taken it with the thumb and the ring finger, he should eat, saying, "I eat with Agni's mouth." Having eaten, he should chew and swallow.
4.11.14	Having sipped water, he should place his hand on his chest, saying, "For Indra's belly, I place you."
4.11.15	Having washed, he should place the vessel for eating there.
4.11.16	Or he should offer it as it was brought.
4.11.17	Having brought the share for Brahma, he should place it there.
4.11.18	He should eat it when the Iṣṭi is over.
4.11.19	One should silently offer the Anvāhārya (to the Pitṛs).
4.11.20	Or one should say, "You are the share of Prajapati."
4.11.21	Now the other part of Prajapati, the nourishing, the moving, the inexhaustible, the inexhaustible, for the inexhaustible thee. Protect my prāṇa and apāna, protect my samāna and vyāna, protect my udāna and ānāyana, protect my prāṇa, protect my apāna, protect me, protect my prāna, protect my apana, protect my prana, protect my apānas, protect my prānāpānas, protect me, the prānāpāna, protect my pränāpānas.
4.11.22	There he should make the sacrificer recite: "I am giving the Anvāhārya (food) in your presence, O Prajapati. O Brahman, you are Brahman. I offer to you. Do not injure me. May the unoffered be auspicious for me."
4.12.1	He should recite the verse for the kindling wood, "O god Savitar, they have proclaimed this sacrifice to thee, to Brihaspati, the Brahman. By that sacrifice, by that lord of sacrifice, by that, may he favour me. May the mind and the radiance accept the ghee. May Brihaspati spread this sacrifice. May he bestow on us an unimpaired sacrifice. May all the gods rejoice here." He should recite softly, "For the establishment" and loudly, "For the prosperity"
4.12.2	Or with the recitation of all (the verses).
4.12.3	He should place the kindling woods when they are freed and arranged, as they come out from the fire.
4.12.4	This is the Brahmanhood of all the Iṣṭis.
4.12.5	One should not sit again on the same seat on the same day, says Śāṇḍilīya.
4.12.6	In the Agni-adheya sacrifices, one should sit down at the first recitation of the mantra and place the kindling wood at the last recitation, says Gautama.
4.12.7	In separate sacrifices, says Dhananjaya.
4.12.8	If he eats four kinds of food, he should give a cow to the Brahman, a cow to the Adhvaryu, a cow with a calf to the Hotṛ, a bull to the Brahman, and a horse-drawn chariot to all, along with earrings.
4.12.9	In the same way, the Agni-place and the cow, says Śāṇḍilya.
4.12.10	One should give a cow, a bull, a heifer, a calf, a goat, a full vessel, and the first oblation.
4.12.11	Similarly, in the subsequent ones, except for the full vessels.
4.12.12	The seventh is the best, or the thirteenth, or the twenty-fifth. This is the Vājasaneyaka.
4.12.13	They perform the rites ending with the Agnihotra, the Pūrṇāhuti, the Akṣahoma and the Iṣṭi.
4.12.14	At the Iṣṭis of the Mituna and Anvarambhaṇīya, they offer the Dakṣiṇās.
4.12.15	Having performed the rites of the Vāja, Aśvina and Gharmāṇas, one should eat the Prāṇabhaks and Pratyakṣabhaks at one's own sacrifice.
4.12.16	Whatever semen is emitted by me, when I go to sleep, or when I am born again, may that enter me for good. May that make me strong. I eat of that strong drink of yours, which has been offered and is being offered. Of the strong drink.
4.12.17	I eat of you, the strong drink of the seasons, the strong drink that is the voice.
4.12.18	Of both of you, of both of you.
5.1.1	When the Varuna-prastha-s are being offered in the Catu-r-masya sacrifices, one should sit down when the Stambayajus is being recited.
5.1.2	When the Catvala is marked, one should return with the Adhvaryu and sit down near the Ahavaniya.
5.1.3	When the fires are being carried forward, one should follow them as they go.
5.1.4	If the Adhvaryu were to say, "O Brahman, remove the ashes from the single-spoon," then having removed the ashes from the Ahavaniya with the spoon, he should move towards the north, dragging from the southern end of the altar.
5.1.5	If there is only one line in the middle.
5.1.6	Having thrown away the spoon, going to the altar from the west, he should sit silently between the two fires being placed.
5.1.7	This is the procedure in all the rites of carrying the fire.
5.1.8	When the Avabhrtha rites are being performed, one should go to the Agnicayana and the Catvala with the eastern (fire) and to the Vedi and the Catvala, with the western (fire). In his own sacrifice, he should move towards the north, in the rites of Haviryajna.
5.1.9	As in the Catvala, so also in the sacrificial post, the Shamitra and the animal.
5.1.10	Having reached the Avabhṛtha rite, they should conclude the Suty rite beginning with sprinkling.
5.1.11	In the Sākamedha rites, one should eat the milk-rice as per the prescribed manner.
5.1.12	One should tell the sacrificer, "Prepare plenty of food. Decorate yourself and your well-wishers." Tell your ministers, "Keep the calves together with their mothers."
5.1.13	In the morning, the Adhvaryu offers the rice cooked in milk to the bull's roar, after seating the Brahman.
5.1.14	After instructing the Brahman, he should say, "Offer!"
5.1.15	In the Pitryajna, one should do everything silently, and only say "Om" as a response.
5.2.1	One should follow the Adhvaryus in wearing the sacrificial thread and the Pracinaavita.
5.2.2	When the oblations are being offered, he should enter by the southern door and sit facing east.
5.2.3	Similarly, when the sacrificial posts are being taken down, one should go to the altar.
5.2.4	When the oblations of clarified butter have been offered, one should go around the fire by the right side and sit facing west. The sacrificer should also do so.
5.2.5	When the Svishtakrit offering is made, they should return as they came and sit down.
5.2.6	Having taken the Prastara, he should sniff it and throw it away.
5.2.7	If the clarified butter falls from the Prastara portion, he should sniff and touch it.
5.2.8	Having received the Ida, he should give it back.
5.2.9	When the Adhvaryu has sprinkled (the fire), they should approach the Ahavaniya, going around the fire on the right, and standing on the north of the southern fire, at their own sacrifice.
5.2.10	"They have not found (you). We have praised you, O bountiful one, in the first (verse). Now indeed, O full-armed one, you go to the place of the flowing (Soma). O Indra, your two horses are following you." The second (verse) is recited in a low voice. "Listen to the song." The third (verse) is uttered.
5.2.11	Then, looking at the Garhapatya fire, we invoke the mind with the Nārāśaṃsa hymn and the thoughts of the ancestors. May the ancestors again give us the mind, the divine people, the living group, may it come to me. May the mind come back for the sacrifice, for power, for life, and to see the sun shining. Thus it is said.
5.2.12	With which one did we have a good time? With one, the southern fire.
5.3.1	The cakes named "Triyambaka" are made of one potsherd.
5.3.2	If the Adhvaryu puts one there, they should touch it there, saying, "May you be auspicious to us, may you be peaceful, may you be gentle, O Sarasvati, may your sky not burn."
5.3.3	They should sit down when the others are being offered. This is the Dhānanjapyā.
5.3.4	Śāṇḍilya says that one should stand.
5.3.5	Those who stand after the oblation should recite: "O Varuna, may we be free from consumption. O Tamba, may you do what is beneficial for us, may you do that which is better for us, may we have cattle, may you give us the means to accomplish our goals. You are the remedy, the remedy for the cow, the horse, and the man. The remedy for the ram and the ewe is good. May it be as it should be."
5.3.6	The priests, taking one cake each, circumambulate the fire thrice.
5.3.7	Here the Brahman should recite the Parayan mantra. This is the opinion of Dhananjaya. Standing here is the opinion of Shandilya. "We worship Tryambaka, the fragrant one, the enhancer of prosperity. May we be released from death, like a ripe fruit from its stem, from the immortal."
5.3.8	Having circumambulated thus, they should go back.
5.3.9	If they desire to obtain a Brahman, he should give it to the one who desires it.
5.3.10	He should touch the hand of the one who has it.
5.3.11	In the same way, they should exchange.
5.3.12	Where the Adhvaryu would place them, there they should stand. "This is your share, O Rudra. With this oblation, go beyond the most powerful. The one wearing a hide, holding a Pināka, with a bow stretched." Thus they should approach the sun.
5.3.13	"May the goddesses be auspicious to us." Having touched the water, they should return without looking back.
5.3.14	The Brahmanhood in the Haviryajnas has been explained in the Varunapraghasa.
5.3.15	When the animals are being offered on the sacrificial post, one should sit silently.
5.3.16	When the offering has been made, it should be done according to the meaning.
5.3.17	When the omentum has been offered, one should sprinkle the water in the sacrificial pit with "This is the water" and then do according to the meaning of all the animals.
5.4.1	When the Purorasa is being offered, one should sit quietly.
5.4.2	Having taken the Puronuvākyā-verses, he should say, "Let those who are going to eat, eat."
5.4.3	One should follow all the animal-sacrifices and the Patnīsaṁyājas. This is the view of Dhananjaya.
5.4.4	Gautama says that it is only of the Savaniya animal.
5.4.5	Śāṇḍilya says that it is neither of the Savaniya nor of the other animals.
5.4.6	The heart-ache is the place of the Avabhrtha-rite. They should touch water there. O king Varuna, from every place of sin do thou release us. If we have transgressed the inviolable waters, from that do thou release us, O Varuna. May the waters be friendly to us. May the herbs be friendly. May they be unfriendly to him who hates us and whom we hate.
5.4.7	From the sprinkling onwards, it is to be done.
5.4.8	One should not stand near the sun.
5.4.9	One should sit when the full oblation is being offered and stand when it is offered.
5.4.10	If they offer oblations of barley, one should sit when they offer oblations.
5.4.11	At the Sautrāmaṇī and Suraka rites, one should sit at the Avraja rite.
5.4.12	At that, two fires are carried forward.
5.4.13	To the right of them was (the fire).
5.4.14	When the two pitchers are hung on the right side and the remnants of the Soma are being sprinkled, they should stand there reciting, "Whatever pure light of yours, O Agni, is spread out, with that purify me, O Brahman."
5.4.15	He should consume the Soma belonging to the Asvins, which Sarasvati has brought forth with her power, which is bright, sweet, and Indra-like, and which is the king of Soma. He should consume it thus.
5.4.16	If the sacrificer is anointed with the remaining fat, then having risen and gone between the fires, he should sing the Sāmans as directed by the Adhvaryu, and stop at each step.
5.4.17	They should offer the final oblations, touching the head of the sacrificer.
5.4.18	"The verses begin with "They press you together..." and each one stops at the final oblation."
5.4.19	At the place of Sravas, for the Kshatriya, for the Vaisya, for the Brahmana, for the Ksatriya, for the Vama, for the Vamana, for the Vamanas, for the Vamas, for the Vams, for the Vamiras, for the Vamaras, for the Vaivasvatas, for the Vasus, for the Vasu, for the Vasavas, for the Vasava, for the Vasavya, for the Vasavyas, for the Vyavas, for the Vyavasa, for the Vyava, for the Vyayas, for the Vyaya, for the Vyayasa, for the Vyasas, for the Yasas, for the Yasa, for the Yasavas, for the Yasu, for the Yasava, for the Yasavyas, for Yasavyas, at the place of Yasavyas, in the place of Yasavya, for Yasavya, at the place for Yasavya.
5.4.20	There are two Sautrāmaṇī sacrifices - the Kukhila and the Caraka Sautrāmaṇa.
5.4.21	The Kukhila is sung with the Sāman, not the other one.
5.4.22	There are seven Havyajñisthānas and seven Somakasthānas.
5.4.23	Among them, the Agnihotra, the Darsha-Paurnamasa, the Catu-r-masya, the Pasu-bandha, the Sautrāmaṇi, and the Pāka-yajna are the sacrifices which are performed with Haviras.
5.4.24	Among them, the Agnishtoma, the Ati-Agnishtoma, the Ukthya, the Shodasha, the Ati-ratra, the Vajapeya, and the Aptoryama are the sacrifices which involve Soma.
5.5.1	At the Sutyā sacrifice, the priest performs the same rites as at the Subrahmaṇyā.
5.5.2	The rites of the Veda-recitation, entering the altar, attending the sacrificial post, receiving the Dakṣiṇā, and eating are performed after the Stoma-release, except for the rites of the Sāman-singers.
5.5.3	However, the rites should be performed at the Diksaniyā.
5.5.4	After the completion of that, the sacrificer should sit down for the Veda-recitations.
5.5.5	When the Adhvaryu would restrain speech, then it would be as per the rule.
5.5.6	When the Mahāvīras are being collected, he should sit silently. When they are collected, it should be as per the rules.
5.5.7	When the Prāyaniya (Sāman) has been concluded, having gone out as per the way he came, he should stand in front of the wife's hall for the Homa of the foot of the king's purchase.
5.5.8-9	Having gone to the north of the place where the Soma is kept, he should sit down silently at the place where the kings are to be bought. Having gone to the east of the place where Soma is kept, having gone to the west of the place where foot-offerings are made, having gone to where the kings are going to be bought, he should sit silently. Having bought the kings, he should go to the east and take them to the west. Having gone around the king to the east, he should follow the king being led to the south.
5.5.10	If the Krita (year) were to pass out by the north,
5.5.11	they would take the king and place him in the east.
5.5.12	Having taken it in the west, one should follow it as it is being drawn (in).
5.5.13	One should follow that very same (year) here, for when it is moving eastwards, it becomes the southern one.
5.5.14	And when the Soma-grasses are released, he should stand outside the wife's hall, moving towards the right, except if he is initiated.
5.5.15	Until the king is brought in.
5.6.1	When the king is being brought in, he should enter following him, without separating from the fire.
5.6.2	If there is a narrow passage, he should enter through the southern door.
5.6.3	If the consecrator is present, he should move to the north of the Ahavaniya and to the west of the Vedi.

5.6.6	When it is placed, they should recite the mantra over the clarified butter of Tānūnapāt, "You are the oblation, Vaiśvānara, unassailable, unassailably, the strength of the gods, unblamed, the protector from blame, unblamed. I have approached the truth by direct means. May you grant me well-being."
5.6.7	Having touched the water, he should be told by the Adhvaryu to relax the king.
5.6.8	They should cover it with gold and touch it, saying, "May the rays of the divine Soma increase for you, O Indra, who knows the one wealth. May Indra increase for you, may he increase for his own self. May you increase for Indra, may you increase for your friend with wisdom. May you be well, O divine Soma, may you attain the Soma-pressing."
5.6.9	Having placed the palms of the hands on the stone of Kasa, with the right ones above and the left ones below, he should recite, "May the gods be pleased with me. May the gods be pleased. May the gods grant me wealth. May the gods bestow wealth. May the auspicious be bestowed. Obeisance to the truth-speaking gods. Obeisance to heaven. Obeisance to earth."
5.6.10	The Upasad-rite is to be performed as before. The sprinkling and the invocation are to be done as before. The animals are to be placed with their heads towards the west in the afternoon. The five animals are to be offered towards the south.
5.6.11	After the Upasad-homa is offered with the ladle, one should know that it is concluded.
5.6.12	The Dharma is to be performed before the Pravargya-rite.
5.7.1	When they are about to take up the Garhapatya, he should go to it and sit down with the Yajus, to the right of the southern fire, to the left of the outer fire, if it is outside.
5.7.2	When the hymn "The heat is pleasing" is recited, they should stand and look at it, as the Adhvaryu says.
5.7.3	Following him as he is being led away, one should recite: "May I follow all the directions, may I conquer all the gods here. Svāhā! Drink the sweet nectar of the heated offering, O Asvins."
5.7.4	Having been announced, one should sit down and recite: "O Asvins, drink the heated offering, for the sake of the day, with the supports of the day, for the sake, with the means. The earth is empty, the sky is empty."
5.7.5	The sacrificer should recite the verse, "May the two Asvins, having offered the oblation, may the heaven and earth have enjoyed the heat. May the blessings be here only."
5.7.6	One should consume the remaining part of the heat with the verse, "We have drunk the honey-offered Agni, O Indra-like Agni, O god, heat, salutations to you, do not harm me."
5.7.7	If there is a Sattra, then the sacrificers should be called by saying "You are being called".
5.7.8	Thus one should always perform the Pravargya and Upasads.
5.7.9	One should sit down when the mantras are being recited for the Stambayajus of the Mahavedi.
5.7.10	When the Catvala is written, it should be as per the meaning.

5.7.14	When it is being piled up, he should sit near it and when it is piled up, he may go away.
5.8.1	When the Āhavanīya fire is being piled up (the Adhvaryu) should sit near it reciting the Yajus.
5.8.2	When the bricks are being piled up on the mound of the Āhavanīyī fire, he should follow them as they are being carried away towards the south.
5.8.3	When they are being placed, he should stand to the right of them and when they are placed, he should touch the water and go back without looking back.
5.8.4	When they are about to kindle the fire and sow the seeds, he should sit silently.
5.8.5	Having returned with them, he should follow the altars being carried.
5.8.6	Standing to the right of the altars being placed, he should sit close to the right side of the altar when they are placed.
5.8.7	The Brahmana who was being honoured in the assembly of the people, was asked to speak the truth. Thus said Sandilya.
5.8.8	Dhananjaya said, "Let him sit."
5.8.9	Thus one should always act in assemblies.
5.8.10	When one is about to perform the rites of the dead, one should be an Avaraja.
5.8.11	One should follow the king's throne being carried away.
5.8.12	Having sprinkled himself with the water as it is being sprinkled, he should return with them, following the fire as it is being carried, reciting the Apra-tiratha silently, if the fire has not been piled up.

5.9.3	From here onwards, the Veda is to be studied silently.
5.9.4	Having bought it, the king should go to the place where it was sold and sit silently.
5.9.5	Having been told to take the king, he should go to the fire with the one who has given it away and take them to the right side, having gone around them clockwise, and follow him. If he has gone to the right,
5.9.6	If he goes by the northern route, then having gone around the fire and taken it, he should follow.
5.9.7	If the Brahman has gone by one route and the king by another, then he should take it by the other.
5.9.8	These two are the options for the Brahman to go, even if he has gone by another.
5.9.9	One should sit between the two oblations being offered, says Dhananjaya.
5.9.10	One should stand, says Sandilya.
5.9.11	He should follow the king of the fire-altar and the oblations being carried towards the north.
5.9.12	Gautama says that having entered, one should go to the Havirdhāna-shed by the western door and sit down.

5.9.14	Having offered the Vapa of the Agniṣomīya animal, one should go back as he came, cross the Cātvāla towards the north and sprinkle it.
5.9.15	In the same way, when the clarified butter has been poured into the fire, one should sit down and sweep (the fire). When the Savanīya Vapa has been offered,

6.1.1	And when the Sāman is being chanted in succession, all (the verses) are to be chanted in the Stoma-sambhava.
6.1.2	And so also in other Sāmans.
6.1.3	Santani is that which is sung in the highest pitch.
6.1.4	Or it is that which is seen in three places, as in the case of the Trica.
6.1.5	And because the Stoma is counted by the Sāman.
6.1.6	The Acharya says in three places.
6.1.7	As in the case of other Sāmans,
6.1.8	And because of continuity, it is Santani.
6.1.9	And it is said, "He sings continuously."
6.1.10	And what is extracted in the Ekarchas is in the Kalpa.
6.1.11	For the purpose of measurement, the Darshanam is in the Tricha, and the Sama-samanta is in the Stotriya.
6.1.12	In all of them, the Prastavas should be according to the Nyaya and Pragatha Dharmas.
6.1.13	The teachers of the Uttarayas are remembered.
6.1.14	And because of the indication of the omission of bhakti, he sings continuously.
6.1.15	His Prastava is in the repetition at the beginning of the Stotra, or in the Paryaya and others.
6.1.16-19	All the verses are to be recited in the first Prastāra. This is the opinion of Dhananjaya. The verses which are to be recited at the end of the Stotras are not to be recited in this context. In the first Prastāras, the verses of Śāṇḍilya are to be recited. In the second and third Stotras, the verses of the Ekīśin are to be recited only in the context of the Viṣṭāvas. In the Trivṛt Stoma, the verses of Parivarti are to be recited.
6.2.3	He should give as much as he wishes.
6.2.4	The second is the Trivṛt pathya, because the first ones are not included.

6.2.6	And in this, it is said, "There is no rain."

6.2.12	Both the verses for the Bhastrā.
6.2.13	One should recite the verses only for the Dhānam.
6.2.14	One should use the verses of the Pathya for the Hotṛ and Sāman, and the verses of the Apathya for the others.
6.2.15	When they are completed, one should again use them from the beginning.
6.2.16	Thus doing, the first of the Praagathika verses is to be changed by the Sandilya.
6.2.17	Having completed all at once, one should then proceed with the Pathya. Thus says Dhananjaya.
6.2.18	Even if the Hotr-s do not complete (the verses), one should do so with the Pathya alone.
6.2.19	If one were to use the Kulayinī, one should perform the second Prstha of the first day with it.

6.3.1	The first verse of the three verses is to be taken as the injunction in the absence of any other direction.
6.3.2	The reverse order is to be followed in the case of the last verse.
6.3.3	The same is to be followed for the middle verse.
6.3.4	The Retasya Ekārikā is to be chanted outside the Pavamāna.
6.3.5	The Anurūpa is to be chanted by Śāṇḍilī.

And there is no prohibition for others. One who makes one verse should make it at the beginning of the first (hymn). Two in that same (hymn). Three in the Ekārcā, in the different Stotriyā (hymns).

6.3.17	If three are in any of them, then they are there.

6.4.1	The Vamadevya is in the third verse. The three beginning with the Visvajit, Shila and Yagnyagniya are in the third verse of the Stoma.
6.4.2	The last one is in the third of all Stomas.
6.4.3	If the second is to be sung in the forest,
6.4.4	then if that is not available, then the one before the last.

6.4.6	If the Ekarch is not prescribed, one should imagine it with this intention.

7.12.10	In the upper half, it illuminates four syllables. It is said in the Brahmana:
7.12.11-13	Two before the sound of the bell, and two after it, says Gautama. The Soma and Shukra are the Dhānajapya. The Anushtubh is the northern one. He sings it as if roaring. This is the Brahmana. We have come to the goal, O Vājī. We have come to the end.
7.12.14	One who sings the Vedic and non-Vedic is a Brahmana.
7.13.1	The entire Brahmana is called "Dhurā". The Tristubh and Jagati meters have the same syllables.
7.13.2	Dhananjaya and Shandilya say that it is of this kind.
7.13.3	One should recite the second pada of that, and the fifth and sixth syllables in the third pada.
7.13.4	The next verse is the Pāṅkti.
7.13.5	It has two syllables, which are connected with the Udasa. From six syllables, it becomes a Brāhmaṇa.
7.13.6	"Ka va iti" is Dhānajapy. "Ka va iti" means Śāṇḍilīya.
7.13.7	"Sad" is the end of the Retasyā, "Sam" is of the Gāyatrī, "Svar" is of the Tristubh, "Ide" is of the Jagatī, "Vāg" is of the Anushtubh.
7.13.8	The rule for them has been stated. They are with the optional Sāmans.
7.13.9	They should not be beyond the Bahispavamāna.
7.13.10	In the first two verses of the Hotr, one should sing the Jagati, Gayatri, Tristubh and Anustubh separately. This is the ancient practice of singing the Ajya.
7.13.11	The Dhanañjapas have transgressed the order of the Gayatri and Tristubh.
7.13.12	In the first two verses, the Maitravaruna sings the Gayatri and the other Hotras sing the Tristubh. This is the old practice of the Hotras singing the Ajya.
7.13.13	Having sung the second verse of the Tristubh metre, one should sing the Anushtubh verse of the same verse. This is the opinion of Dhananjaya.
8.1.1	At the time of the sacrifice, when the auspicious days of the northern solstice and the first half of the month coincide, there is no specific instruction.
8.1.2	And the Dakshina cows are given only in number.
8.1.3	One should give gold, which means gold obtained from mines.
8.1.4	In the first case, the consecration should be done on the day of the lunar asterism.
8.1.5	Or, having seen the conjunction of the lunar asterisms.
8.1.6	Of those, one consecration is done without instruction, and three or four or unlimited (consecrations).
8.1.7	Three Upasads.
8.1.8	Gautama says that the Jyotistoma has the Saura and the Narmesha Atiratra as the concluding verses, and the other ones as the concluding verses. Because of the acceptance of the practice.
8.1.9	The other sacrifices are not so, because of the general statement.
8.1.10	The other sacrifices also are to be performed at the Atirātra, says Śāṇḍilya, because of the common injunction.
8.1.11	There would be option between the Aṣṭādaṃṣṭra and the Atirātr.
8.1.12	The Sāubhara and the Nārmeḍha are considered as optional with the Atirātras, because of the desire for the Upakalpas.
8.1.13	But the Upakalpa is found to be in the Anushtubh metre.
8.1.14	And it is seen elsewhere that the night-offerings are not the same as in the case of the Pañcaha of the Abhiplva.
8.1.15	The Anushtubh verse should be the Stotriya in the Ukthants at the Atiratras, because of the division of the performance.
8.1.16	The Jyotishtoma, which is independent, has the options of the Agnishtoma, Ukthya and Atiratra as its conclusion.
8.1.17	The Dakṣiṇā for the Anatiraatra is one hundred and twelve.
8.1.18	For the Goāyus.
8.1.19	The Yajamāna should perform the Viśvajit and Abhijit sacrifices in succession, says Dhānajāpya.
8.1.20	Simultaneously, says Śāṇḍilya.
8.1.21	The Abhijit should be performed on the right side of the Devayajana, and the Viśva-jit on the left side.
8.1.22	The Pātnīśāla should be in front of it.
8.1.23	The rites performed within the altar are not performed by non-priests.
8.1.24	The rites performed outside the altar are performed by one.
8.1.25	The Abhijit should be performed before the Visvajit.
8.1.26	The Dakshina for both is a thousand each.
8.1.27	One may perform these two rites as one wishes.
8.1.28	The Dakshinā for Abhijit is a thousand, for Visvajit a hundred horses or a thousand of all kinds.
8.2.1	Having risen from that, he should perform the rites, having put on the garment of Rohini, which is made of wool. Those rites have been mentioned by the Brahman.
8.2.2	One should dwell in the Udumbara tree, as one dwells in three forests.
8.2.3	In the absence of an Udumbara tree one should dig a branch of an Udumbari tree.
8.2.4	One should live by digging, if there is digging there.
8.2.5	If there is no pit, one should bury the grain vessels and live by digging them up.
8.2.6	The ploughshare is on both sides, says Shandilya.
8.2.7	Whatever it may be, says Dhananjaya.
8.2.8	One should live near a Nisada village, says Parashva.
8.2.9	Among them, one may eat the food of the forest, nīvara, śyāmāka, and mārga.
8.2.10	The people are of three kinds: the royal kinsmen, the brahmins, and the common people, says Śāṇḍilīya.
8.2.11	The people who are eligible for marriage are of the same gotra, and the commoners, says Dhānajāpya.
8.2.12	The people of the same country are the commoners, where one resides, says Śāndilīyāna.
8.2.13	These are the rites for all those who give the entire sacrificial fee to the Vedas.
8.2.14	Gautama says that one should bind the cow to the post on the new moon day when all are observing vows, except for those who are observing the vow for a year.
8.2.15	After performing the six-day Soma sacrifices for more than a year, one should rise.
8.2.16	At the end of the year, they should buy the king at the night-long sacrifices.
8.2.17	They should consecrate themselves according to their caste in the first fifteen-night sacrifice.
8.2.18	According to their caste everywhere else, except if it is a special case, says Dhananjaya.
8.2.19	If it is not a special case, then it is not, says Shandilya.
8.2.20	There are three consecrations for the one-day vow, according to Gautama.
8.2.21	Six or twelve.
8.2.22	There, he should give a hundred horses and chariots to Brahma.
8.2.23	Similarly, to the Adhvaryu who performs the Agnihotra.
8.2.24	To the Udgātṛ who praises with the Prstha Sāman.
8.2.25	And to the Hotṛ who instructs him.
8.2.26	All of them should be given a thousand.
8.2.27	Or all of them should be paid with a thousand.
8.2.28	The other one is the Śāṇḍila.
8.2.29	All of these are separate and paid with a thousand.
8.3.1	One who is going to perform the Sadyaskra sacrifice should offer the Prātarāhuti at the Mahārātra time and then announce to the priests, "We are performing the Sadyaskrā."
8.3.2	Dhananjaya says that one should send them early in the morning. From the Diksā onwards, everything should be done immediately. For the first two and the Śyenas.
8.3.3	The Sadyaskrā ends with one or three. This is the practice of cleanliness.
8.3.4	The sacrificial altar is the fertile land. The first of the two kinds of barley is the ripe one, the other is the fertile one.
8.3.5	From that very place they should cut out the northern altar.
8.3.6	The ploughshare is the sacrificial post. The ploughshare is the post, and the ploughshare is the cup-shaped part.
8.3.7	If one were to perform the sacrifice at the time of barley or rice, one should offer the grains in a vessel and then sow them.
8.3.8	The vessel containing the grains should be placed on the northern altar, and the cup should be placed on it.
8.3.9	A bull with three calves is called "many". A bull with three years is called "belonging to the people". A bull with two years is called "with three calves".
8.3.10	One who milks three times.
8.3.11	A bull should be three years old.
8.3.12	The Hotr should be brought in front, the Udgâtri in the east, the Adhvaryu in the west, the Brahman in the south. Or they may be brought in front. There they should be told about Soma. Having gone by chariot-horses, they are told about the roads by the Brahman.
8.3.13	The priests should do this. Śāṇḍilya said, "Having brought other good Brahmins to the path, they should tell them about Soma there. This is done on the same day. I tell this to Indra, all the gods, Brahmins, Soma-drinkers and Soma-drinkers."
8.3.14	Then, when the milk and curds are ready, they should be filled with fresh milk and curds. Then, the butter should be churned out, or the foam should be taken out. They should also be added to the ghee.
8.3.15	The white horse should be given as Dakṣiṇā to the Udgātṛ. A little bit should be given to the others.
8.4.1	The Uttara Sāman has been explained by this alone.
8.4.2	And for her the Dakṣiṇās are twenty-one. Therefore it is so.
8.4.3	For one night, without loss, is the Anukrī. They (the Angiras) said to the Ādityas, "Tomorrow we will give."
8.4.4	Gautama says that the day after the purchase should be the next day. He says, "They are bought immediately," to the Ādhyas, not to others.
8.4.5	The next day, the buyer is called the seller.
8.4.6	The previous day should be the day of fasting, says Dhananjaya. "They say, "Tomorrow's buying," and they say, "Tomorrow, buying will happen." It should have been said, "Buying will happen tomorrow."
8.4.7	He shows the first one as being bought immediately, and the second one as being bought on the same day.
8.4.8	But because of the deficiency of two, the Angirasas bought it at a lower price. Therefore, it is called Anukrīti.
8.4.9	Its horse was the one hundred and first in the Dakṣiṇās. The horse is Vaiv.
8.4.10	This is said to be the Viśvajit Śilī.
8.4.11	The two-day Śāṇḍilī is deficient by three.
8.4.12	The first day is the Daiksa day, beginning with the purchase of the Soma and ending with the Upavasatha day. The second day is the Sautrāmaṇī day.
8.4.13	For that, one should give vehicles as dakṣiṇā according to one's ability. In that country, those vehicles which are most desired should be given.
8.4.14	He should give the entire Veda and the Nirman. This is the opinion of Dhananjaya. The bed should be measured. The ascent is for the day. The pair of slaves, the handful of grain, the plough, and the cow. This is the cow.
8.5.1	The priests should choose the sons of the warriors and the followers, the sons of the Vratinas, the sons of Yaudhis, and the sons of Anucas. The son of a hawk.
8.5.2	Only those who are worthy. This is the view of Shandilya.
8.5.3	If there are no trees or posts, one should churn the clarified butter.
8.5.4	If there are many trees or posts, they should be cut down and a sacrificial place should be made.
8.5.5	Or a burning ground should be the sacrificial place.
8.5.6	On the vehicle by which the dead body is carried, they should make a sacrificial place and a sacrificial post.
8.5.7	The sacrificial post is without a cup and with the top like a yoke.
8.5.8	The priests should move wearing red turbans, red garments, and girdles, with the Upota and Parusha (kinds of grass) and bows.
8.5.9	In the Brihatī Sāman, the Rathantara Sāman is to be sung in place of the single verse. This is the place for the single verse in the Brihatī. Thus it becomes in the Trivṛt Sāman.
8.5.10	If there is no prohibition, one may perform the other rites. This is a lesser modification.
8.5.11	In that case, one should offer the fifth Barhaspatya oblation according to the Stoma. It should be offered to Puramda, because the Brāhmaṇa shows that it is for the destruction of enemies.
8.5.12	The teachers say that the two verses should be at the end of the Rathantara. Thus they become well-arranged.
8.5.13	Gautama says that it is Kakavati. He does not show repetition in this Stoma.
8.5.14	One who is performing the Brahma-saman should perform the Syama-saman in the Kakavati verses.
8.5.15	There is no repetition of the Pavamani verses at this place.
8.5.16	The Dakshina is nine times nine. One should give the Dakshina to the nine classes. One should give encouragement to the blind, the deaf, the dumb, and the lame.
8.5.17	Even for them, at the time of giving Dakshina, they should generate red (blood).
8.5.18	In one place, they should do everything immediately.
8.5.19	Gautama says, "One should be initiated once and attend three Upasads."
8.5.20	His Gayatri verse is "Ayaruchi, the one from the womb."
8.5.21	Purorjittiyaṃ iti Śāṇḍilyaḥ, tasyāḥ sasutveyaṃ vasūnām iti etāṃ madhye kuryāt |
8.5.22	Prācīm anu pradiśaṃ yāti cikitad iti etasyāṃ udvaṃśīyaṃ kuryāt, uddhṛtya gāyatrapārśam iti Lāmakāyanaḥ |
8.5.23	The Trika is the Bahispavamāna. Thus says Dhananjaya. The Pañci is the Madhyandin. The Sapta-Arbha is the Ekini-Tarani.
8.5.24	The Pavamānas and the Hotṛṣāmanis are the Trikas and the Ekini-Taranis.
8.5.25	The number of verses in the Catu-Uttara-Sampanna is 26. The number of verses in each Trika is 5. The number of Trikas is 2. The number of Ekini-Tāranis is 1. The number of Tarani-Tāranīs is 1.
8.5.26	The Dakṣiṇā for this is 660.
8.6.1	Those who are going to perform the Vratya Stoma rites, having kindled separate fires and having performed the sacrificial requisites, among them, the one who is most learned in the Vedas or the one who has attained the highest position, or in his absence, the one who has obtained wealth, they should consecrate the Garhapatya fire and partake of the oblations.
8.6.2	Those who are Vratyas and perform the rites, they should perform the first sacrifice.
8.6.3	The others are mentioned by the Brāhmaṇa.
8.6.4	Those who are old and have ceased to beget children, they are the Śamanīca-ameḍhas.
8.6.5	What is said in the Nirukta, that they should go to Indra, the heaven, and the sun, that is a prohibition.
8.6.6	They should go according to the injunction.
8.6.7	The Uṣṇīṣa and the Pratoda, the Uṣṇīșa is what is oblique and not added, of the Vrātyas.
8.6.8	The chariot-warriors go forth with bows and arrows, with the bow-string as their banner.
8.6.9	The chariot-path is strewn with grass. The chariot-path going east is not strewn.
8.6.10	The chariot is yoked with horses and mules mixed together. So says Saandilya.
8.6.11	With which horses and mules? So says Dhaanaanjaya.
8.6.12-16	Krishnaśaṃvāsa is the name of Krishnakahaṇḍamitra. Śāṇḍilya says that it is white and black. Gautama says that it is black. Dhananjaya says that it is only black. If two goats are bought with two coins, then the black goat should be given to the one who has the black goat and the white goat to the one who owns the white goat. Balakṣa is the name of the white goat.
8.6.17-20	A Nishka is a coin of silver. All this is to be given by the householder. The householder should give thirty-three. Thirty-three or two-thirty-three, says Śāṇḍilya. The garments of the others should be of the colour of owls, with tassels and fringes.
8.6.21-24	The two kinds of garments are called dāma and tūsani. Two kinds of garments are known as dāma and tusani. Two pairs of shoes are called devopānahā. The two kinds of shoes are called Devopānahā and Kṛṣṇakārnini. The two types of shoes are called Dāma and Tūṣani.
8.6.25	The two kinds of garments for the enemies and the benefactors have been explained by the two previous verses.
8.6.26	And he should give each of the others thirty-three, and the householder should approach with thirty-three. For he says, "They should give thirty-three to the priests."
8.6.27	They should give thirty three to the priests.
8.6.28	Those who are not free from the conduct of the Vratyas, or who give to a Brahman-bondman or to a Magadha-countryman, they go to ruin in that very place, so it is said.
8.6.29	Having performed the Vratya Stotras, they should establish themselves in the livelihood of the Trividya.
8.6.30	He may eat them afterwards, and may also sacrifice to them as he pleases.
8.7.1	In the Agniṣṭoma sacrifices, one should give according to one's ability, oxen, horses, goats, and gold.
8.7.2	One who deserves something but does not obtain it, should sacrifice with the Trivṛt (stoma) in the first (sacrifice).
8.7.3	And the chariot with four horses as Dakṣiṇā. One of them should be black.
8.7.4	One whom the Brāhmaṇas, the kings of themselves, would honour, he should offer in the Brihaspati-sava.
8.7.5	At his morning pressing, when the Nārāśaṃsa verses have been recited, he should distribute eleven Dakṣiṇās to the priests and not withhold them.
8.7.6	Twelve horses at midday.
8.7.7	She removes them from both.
8.7.8	At the third pressing, when the oblation of the Vapa animal has been offered, one should remove eleven (animals).
8.7.9	Those (animals) also would be eleven, or eleven hundred, or a thousand. But the horse is always at midday.
8.7.10	Those who would place him in front, following the course of the past, should thereafter follow them.
8.7.11	And they would call him the Sthapati.
8.7.12	The arrow of the hawk is explained. The Upasads are one-day-long.
8.8.1	One who is going to perform the Sarvasvara sacrifice should strive from the consecration onwards, so that he may go to the Sautiya day.
8.8.2	One should eat all the food offerings everywhere, eating the food of the breath.
8.8.3	The sacrificer should offer them to the waters or should follow them.
8.8.4	Having mixed Soma with water, they should take it to the place of Marjalyas.
8.8.5	At the Pavamāna (hymn) in the Ārbhava (Stotra), while being praised, he should lie down on the southern side, having spread a black antelope skin, with his head towards the south. It is said, "That (Soma) is united with that (skin) and dies."
8.8.6	The sacrificer who is dead should be consigned to the fire along with the oblations and the sacrificial vessels in the Āhavanīya fire. So says Śāṇḍilī.
8.8.7	They should conclude the remaining rites. So says Dhānyaka.
8.8.8	If they conclude the remaining rites, then according to Śāṇḍilyāyana, the sacrificer should be released from the Kṛṣṇājina and the oblations should be consumed.
8.8.9	The priests should offer the oblations at the end of the sacrifice. This is the Dhānajāpya.
8.8.10	When the day is over, they should perform the activities of the Asandi.
8.8.11	They should wash with "Santuva ṛṇanti."
8.8.12	They should cut with "Santuve tatakṣṇuḥ."

8.8.15	Having completed the remaining part of the Anubandhyā, they should build a pyre in the middle of the Devayajana.
8.8.16	Then they should place the Garhapatya fire behind, the Ahavaniya fire in front, the Garhapaty fire to the west, and the Agnidhra fire to the south. They should circumambulate it.
8.8.17	He should arrange the sacrificial vessels around the body of the deceased person lying on the funeral pyre with the head towards the south.

8.8.19	The ladle should be placed on the forehead.
8.8.20	The Praishitra vessel should be placed on his forehead.
8.8.21	The two nostrils are the two ladles.
8.8.22	Having placed gold in the mouth, and having covered the mouth with a cow-skin, one should place the Agnihotra ladle there, bending it.
8.8.23	The Juhu ladle in the right hand.
8.8.24	The Upabhu ladle in the left hand.
8.8.25	Similarly the two kidneys.
8.8.26	The Dhruva ladle on the chest.
8.8.27	The Patra ladle in the belly.
8.8.28	The black antelope skin on the genitals.
8.8.29	We shall not use the pestle, the mortar, the stone for pounding, and the wooden ladle, except for the sake of the sacrifice.
8.8.30	The pestle is to the right of the right thigh.
8.8.31	The mortar is to the left of the left thigh.
8.8.32	The wooden ladle is at the feet.
8.8.33	Having placed the sacrificial ladles with clarified butter on them, upside down, he should place the Ulaparāji-grass and the Tanu-grass for all the fires, so that the fires may be united in this (fire).
8.8.34	If one goes to the Ahavaniya fire first, one should know that one will go to the world of Brahma. If one goes to the Garhapatya fire, one will go to Devaloka. If one goes the Dakshina Agni, one will go the world of the ancestors.
8.8.35	When the sacrificial vessels are ready, the Chandogas should chant the hymn "In the sky, the Suparna" three times.
8.8.36	When smoke rises, they should chant "O smoke, you are shining."
8.8.37	When the fire is burning, they should chant either "O Agni, you are kind and great" or "O Agni, your flames are shining."
8.8.38	This is the only verse for all those who have not yet established the sacred fire.
8.8.39	If the person lives, he should offer a sacrifice with the Udasaniya rite.
8.8.40	Then, not eating, he died.
8.8.41	One who wishes to live should eat, says Dhananjaya.
8.8.42	His food should be given as Dakshina.
8.8.43	One should begin the Caturmasya rites on the full moon day of Phalguna.
8.8.44	The time has been mentioned by the Brahmana.
8.8.45	On the day of the sacrifice, the Vaisvadev and Sunasirya should be the last, and the Varuna-Prāghasi
8.8.46	The last of the Sākamedhas should be on the Parvan day.
8.8.47	The Sunasirya has a hundred and twelve as Dakshina.
8.8.48	The others have fifty each.
8.9.1	In the Upāhvaya, the names of the deities should be mentioned indirectly in their own places.
8.9.2	Direct perception is not to be used in the case of unstable things.
8.9.3	Everywhere they should avoid the word "god".
8.9.4	They should say "the Hotṛ is the god of Mahīmitra, the Hotṛ is at the great sacrifice" and "Indra" for Soma.
8.9.5	The Dakṣiṇā is prescribed by the Brāhmaṇa.
8.9.6	One should also give something to others.
8.9.7	In the Rtapeyya, there are three Upasads, with twelve Doṣas.

8.9.9	He should eat with the reverse fingers and joints, saying, "He approaches with each higher section," at the separate Upasads, says Dhananjaya.
8.9.10	The cups are to be measured by the fingers, each finger having joints. They are to be used in the order of their joints. This is said by Shauchi-Vrikshi.
8.9.11	Shaandilya says that they are to be used against the order of their fingers.
8.9.12	The priests who are going to perform the Prasuti ceremony should say "Truth" and then proceed. Those who are going to eat in the Sadas should say "This is the earth, this is the sun".
8.9.13	Those deities who are to be worshipped with cups should recite the mantras for eating after drinking. This is said by Shandilya.
8.9.14	But the Nārāśamsa mantras are without change.
8.9.15	The Soma cup is the dakshina. This would apply to the Soma that has been pressed, because the cup is the measure in that.
8.9.16	At midday, they should offer him together with the Savanamukhiyas. The Brāhmaṇa says, "The offering should be made after the oblation."
8.9.17	At dusk, having taken him to the east of the Ahavaniya without carrying him away, having led the Sadas and Havirdhana fires to the south of the Veda, they should make him enter the Sadas through the eastern door.

8.10.6	The sacrificial fee is twelve hundred or a thousand cows, as much as one can afford. Five autumnal animals are offered.
8.10.7	One should perform the Tīvrasūti Soma sacrifice for purification."
8.10.8	He who, having performed the Soma sacrifice, becomes worse, he is indeed purified by the Soma. This is the opinion of Shandilya.
8.10.9	He who, having drunk Soma, vomits or becomes intoxicated, this is the opinion of Dhananjaya.
8.10.10	There, having praised with the Acchāvāka hymn, they should eat the cups filled with food. The priests eat the cups after smelling them. For it is said, "They eat the cups at the Acchāvaaka hymn."
8.10.11	Thus at all the Savanas.
8.10.12-14	They should offer the Soma which is to be offered in the morning, in the morning. They should offer the Soma to be offered in evening, in the evening.

9.1.7	If it is so, then there are two for the Abhiarohaniya also.

9.3.2	On the full moon day, there is an Atiratra sacrifice.
9.3.3	Having performed the Dashapaye sacrifice, one should perform the Keshavapaini sacrifice in the same Uttaraparshva (i.e., the second day of the Dashapayeshtisha) as the previous one. This is the opinion of Dhananjaya. The Atiratra should be performed after the Full Moon.
9.3.4	The Dakshina is one thousand.
9.3.5	Having performed the Udasananiya Ishti, one should initiate for the Vyukshidvi-ratra on the Full Moon day, if one wishes to perform the previous day on the New Moon day.
9.3.6	If it is said that it is on the full moon day, then one should initiate on the preceding fortnight.
9.3.7	Of the two considerations, the subsequent day is to be sacrificed.
9.3.8	If it is said that the subsequent day is for the Vyastaka, then they say that the first three days of Tamisa are Vyastaka.

9.4.5	Having performed the Upavasatha rite for those who are in the earlier stage of life and have been initiated, one should again perform the Stoma sacrifice when returning to them.
9.4.6	The Daksiṇās for this should be twelve pairs. This is according to Dhānajāpya.

9.4.16	One should offer these to the king, says Dhananjaya.

9.5.17	The previous one is in its place.
9.5.18	At the same time as his.
9.5.19	The Uśanas of Partha.
9.5.20	Those very embryos on the backs.
9.5.21	One should offer the embryos in the Ajyās at the Vaisvajit, and the Dhānajāpya in the Ukthas at the Ṣaṣṭhikā Ukthas.
9.5.22	As it was done according to the method of the sages, says Śaucivrīṣi.
9.5.23	At the Jyotistoma or Atiratra, one should add extra Stotras. This is the opinion of Sandilya.
9.5.24	Those very Garbha hymns are in the Prstha stotras, and the Brihat-garbha is in the Yagyayajniya.

9.6.17	Having bought it with another cow, reciting the names of cows in its right ear, one should release it among cows.
9.6.18	The Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice is to be performed in the Dvādaśāha sacrifice, because of the mention of it in the next verse.
9.6.19	And because of the indication of that, just as in the case of the Pṛṣṭhas.
9.6.20	And because it is mentioned again, in the case of Aheinaikāha and others.
9.6.21	But in the case of those enjoined in different contexts, there would be no connection because of the mention in the next verse, just as in Upahvya and Arttāpeya.
9.6.22	The mention of the Linga is for some other purpose, as in the case of the Shakvaris on the sixth day.
9.6.23	The repetition of the injunction of the remainder.
9.7.1	In that independent case, the night would be deficient, because the deficiency is enjoined in general.
9.7.2	But it would be natural, because of the injunction in the context.
9.7.3	The general injunction of the remainder, as in the Caturavattam.
9.7.4	This shows that the utterance of Om is a repetition of the words of the Veda.
9.7.5	But the combination is not so, because of the different meanings. For the Om is for the purpose of the beginning and conclusion of the Udgitha, etc., and the words are for the purpose of expressing the meaning.
9.7.6	The word is first, because of the proximity of the meaning.
9.7.7	Or the word may be later, because of the inferior nature of the injunction and the practice.
9.7.8	In the Ekastomas, the Vaitrambana and the Triratra, the Svāstara should be the night. Thus there is a junction, because it operates in both ways without any change.
9.7.9	And the exclusion of the Trivṛt is not possible elsewhere except at the junction. The Trivṛt Atiratra is mentioned separately.
9.7.10	And the expectation of operation is found by the injunction, as in the case of "The sixteenth is the first of the nights".
9.7.11	The statement of the meaning is the application in the Sāman.
9.7.12	Or it is practice.
9.7.13	Having placed the Agni of the Brahmanas on the Hotr's Dhishnya, they should keep the Agni on the first day, which they should bring at midday.

9.8.1	One who desires a thousandfold prosperity should perform the Shabali offering.
9.8.2	Here, Shandilya says, "One who performs the three-night sacrifice should not do this," because he says, "One performs this for three nights."
9.8.3	Dhananjaya says, "One should do this if one desires a thousandfold prosperit
9.8.4	In the spring season, having shaved his head and beard on the first half of the month, he should wear a new garment, and lie down for twelve nights on a raised platform, drinking hot milk.
9.8.5	His fire should be always burning in his house.
9.8.6	No other friend or servant should enter it.

9.8.10	One should offer it with the formula, "You are the oblation, you are the ocean."
9.8.11	The oblation is concluded with the word "svāhā".
9.8.12	If any remnant of the oblation remains in the ladle, one should take it in a bowl and eat it.
9.8.13	Having washed the ladle, the spoon, and the bowl, one should put them aside.
9.8.14	Here, one should offer the oblation again, says Śāṇḍilyāyana.
9.8.15	Having gone out of the village towards the east or north, where one does not hear the sound of domestic animals, having gone to that forest, having taken a clump of darbha grass, one should cry three times with a loud voice, "Shabali, Shabali!"
9.8.16	If one hears the barking of a dog or a donkey, one should know that the rite has been accomplished.
9.8.17	Thus one should perform the sacrifice for three years without interruption.
9.8.18	If a dog or a donkey were to interrupt the sacrifice in the beginning, one should know that it is not auspicious for the animals.
9.8.19	And the sacrifice for three without interruption.

9.9.9	When the Pūṣṇīya sacrifice is completed, one should release a horse and protect it with the same (horse).
9.9.10	There are three Iṣṭis dedicated to Savitr. When they are completed, the sacrificer, facing east, seated on a golden cushion to the south of the Āhavanīya fire, should listen to the Hotr reciting the Pariplavam verses of the Samvatsara day by day.
9.9.11	The Brahma-Udgātṛ should recite facing north.
9.9.12	One should give a hundred to the Hotr and ten to the Adhvaryu.

9.9.16	On that day, the priests should take their seats as they please.

9.10.2	She is not neglected, she is surrounded.
9.10.3	When the animals have been consecrated, the Brahman should recite the Vāta-sūkta, raising it upwards like a load on a mountain. Then he should recite the middle verse of the Jatu-sūkta in the wind, saying, "May it return again."
9.10.4	A hundred of his sons should be his followers, and his daughters should be his attendants. They should greet him, saying, "May you be raised up above him!" Like a mountain carrying a load, then they should point to his middle, saying, "Here is the cotton, here is the wool."
9.10.5	The Udgātṛ recites the Parivṛkta verse. The small and large (parts) of her body, which are small and large, he has placed in the two thighs. The small parts of her body, that are small, he has placed on the two sides of the cow's skin. He should point out the small parts.
9.10.6	Let a hundred of her sons, the leaders of the Sūtas, follow her as her attendants, and let them greet her with the words, "The gods have rejoiced in the shining one, the winner of the race, the one who has been pointed out by the legs." Let the woman be pointed out as the one who has the eyes of the sun.
9.10.7	Having touched water, they should sing the Vāmadevya hymn and recite it afterwards.
9.10.8	Having sat down to the east, they should recite the Brahma-hymn with the Svāhā-formulas.
9.10.9	When the Hotṛ-Adhvaryu has spoken, the Brahman should ask the Udgātṛ, "I ask you, O Citayan, O friend of the gods, whatever you know here in your mind, in which of the three places Vishnu is present, in which of them the entire universe has entered."
9.10.10	He may say to him, "In those three places where Vishnu entered, in those three places where the universe entered, I roam the earth and heaven in a moment with one limb. The back of heaven is his."
9.10.11	The Udgātṛ asks the Brahman, "What is the man within? What is given to the man within? O Brahman, we offer this oblation to you. What did you say to us here?"
9.10.12	He should say to him, “The five men entered the inner man. Those five men are entrusted to the inner man. I am reflecting on them. Do not be deceived by him. He is above me.”
9.10.13	All the sacrificers should ask him (the Adhvaryu), "We ask thee about the farthest end of the earth, we ask about the navel of the world, we ask thee about the seed of the horse of Vṛṣa, we ask about speech's highest heaven."
9.10.14	He should say to them, "This is the altar, the highest point of the earth, this is the sacrifice, the navel of the universe, this is Soma, the seed of the horse, the Brahman, the highest space of speech."
9.10.15	On the first day, he should give a thousand as Dakshina. Similarly on the last day.
9.10.16	On the middle day, if there is wealth belonging to non-Brahmins in a single country, he should give that.
9.10.17	Or he may perform the sacrifice in the middle of the conquered territory.
9.11.1	He should give the eastern direction to the Hotṛ, the southern to the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, and the northern to the Udgātṛ. This is the consideration for both the fields and the men.
9.11.2	Or they may say, "We do not want more than this."
9.11.3	Or he may give to the principal workmen four thousand eight hundred, to each of the others twenty-four, to the half-workers twelve, to the third-workers six.
9.11.4	These are the minimum wages; but he may give more if he likes.
9.11.5	The alternatives are these:
9.11.6-10	One should perform the fifteen-Stoma days. That is the Patantuka horse sacrifice. One should perform this sacrifice after having grazed the horse for a month. The Jyotistoma is its Atiratra. The third day should be that. By that one should graze for a month. The cow is that. By that three. The Ayas is that. By it six.
9.11.11	The natural order of these days is that the third day should be a little less.
9.11.12	The days of the Vīśvajit and the Abhijit sacrifices are the same as those of the Vratāpti sacrifice.
9.11.13	In these, the Stoma-invocations alone should be used, just as in the three-day sacrifices of the Catuṣṭoma and Sarva-stoma, there is no omission of the procedure.
9.11.14	They would be independent, because they are defined as such, and because they are raised in the beginning, and because of the Stoma-insistence in the case of the Catuṣṭoma and Sarva-stoma.
9.11.15	Because of the statement, there is omission of the Tantras, as in the case of Jāmi-kalpa in all the Svara-s.
9.12.1	One should initiate on the thirteenth day of the dark fortnight for Jamadagni.
9.12.2	His initiation lasts for twenty days, and the Upasads for twelve days.
9.12.3	There, at the Upavasatha, the Adhvaryu should offer the oblations separately. The Puronuvākyās for them have been mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa.
9.12.4	The morning and afternoon are of the same deity.
9.12.5	The Homa beginning with "Agniveha Hotrā"
9.12.6	Having risen from the Avabhṛtha, one should perform the twelve-day Iṣṭi.
9.12.7	These are the reverse Puronuvākyās.
9.12.8	On the fourth day of the Vasatīvarī ceremony, one should separately arrange the Brihatī and Anushtubh verses in order, saying, "For the mother of Vasīshtha and for the mother of Sansarpa." The fourth day is the place of the mother.
9.12.9	There is an option between them according to the Arsheyaka Kalpa.
9.12.10	One should perform the sacrifice of animal-sacrifice in the month of Ashvina on the seventh or eighth day of the bright fortnight.
9.12.11	They should offer only the calves and cows, and let go the bulls.
9.12.12	They should let go as many other animals as they have lost, even if they are not sacrificed. They should let go animals of similar kind for as many years.
9.12.13	In the sixty-first year, one should perform the sacrifice in the month of Kārttika in autumn.
9.12.14	It has twelve Upasads.
9.12.15	In the third six-day period, the Ukthas should be performed in descending order on the fifth day. This is what the teacher says, because here it is like the five-day period of the gods.
10.1.2	If one of them is not possible, the purchase would be for the other party.
10.1.3	And if there is a birth, it would be for two.
10.1.4	If there is a birth for three, then the previous party would be the only one to arise.
10.1.5	For them, the initiation is twelve times, and the upasads are without instruction.
10.1.6	Beyond the annual ones, the initiations are as desired.
10.1.7	In the first month, there are fifteen nights, nineteen consecrations, Dhananjaya, Ekastaka, Mahavrata, and the New Moon Atiratra. Thus it is said.
10.1.8	Gautama says eighteen, the Full Moon Atiratra is thus said.
10.1.9	Or the Jatika Kalpa.
10.1.10	The eighteen consecrations, beginning with the sixteen-night consecration and ending with the thirty-night consecration, are fifty-one nights.
10.1.11	The sacrifices beginning with the twelve-night sacrifice.
10.1.12	He should perform it with the Aheenahuta, because in this Brahmanical text it shows the signs of the Aheenahutas, as in the case of the one-night consecration.
10.1.13	On the first day, while performing the Brahma-sāman with one syllable, one should perform the Naudhasa-sāman.
10.1.14	Its Uṣṇīsa-sāman should have one syllable as the Niṣadha. It should be in the place of Naudhasa or Naudhasa itself.
10.1.15	The Tuṣṇīkṣu of the Bāhrata-sāmans are without performance. Here there are many Sāmans with more than one syllable as Niṣadha.
10.1.16	Therein one should perform the Pauṣkalāni, because the Sāmans here are mostly Jyotiṣṭoma.
10.2.1	In the Śarkarīṣu, one should chant with the Ṣoḍaśī, according to the Gaurīvit. In the Mahānāmniṣu, there should be a verse, because that is the injunction in that context.
10.2.2	In the Mahānāmnis, there should be only the Ṣoḷaśī Sāman, because nothing else is applicable in them.
10.2.3	And in the Stotras of the Prsthastotra, he performs the Parokṣa rites, but not the Nitya-vatsa rites.
10.2.4	And the Vajra is performed in this place.
10.2.5	In the Viraṭs and Anushtup, the Gaurīvit should be performed, because the sixteen Sāmans are mostly Svaras.
10.2.6	The teachers say that the desirable concluding verses should be in the places of the nests of the Śarkvarīs, because they are most numerous.
10.2.7	Gautama and Dāṇḍanīti say that they should be in the Udghosa alone, because here he speaks of the concluding verses.
10.2.8	Śaucivrīṣi says that it is in the Athakāra place, because there is less modification.
10.2.9	Kauts says that it is at all the places of the concluding verses, because there is no restriction.
10.2.10	The excrement is connected with the excellent Stotriya hymn. This is said by Dhananjaya.
10.2.11	Having praised with the Śarkvarī hymns, one should avoid the excrement. Therefore, it should be unconnected.
10.2.12	It should be at the end of a section or at the end of the Stotra.
10.2.13	On the fifth day, one should perform the Rāyovājiya Brahma-sāman, which is appropriate for that occasion.
10.2.14	One should perform the Bāhrhadgīra, because the Geha and Sāman are seen on the same day.
10.2.15	Performing the Pārthurasma, one should perform it in the Bāhrhadgīra, for the continuity of the verses.
10.3.1	Some say that the tenth day is Ananga, because it is mentioned as being outside the Patnīsaṃyājas. It is indeed a place for the Stotras.
10.3.2	"The Agniṣṭomas are on both sides."
10.3.3	He also speaks of creation by means of a part.
10.3.4	But it would be an Anga, because of the mention in the context.
10.3.5	"The place for the Stotra" means that even the single Stotra does not have independence.
10.3.6	The statement that the Agniṣṭoma and the Ukthya are the two ends of the sacrifice is a mere statement. The Atiratra is mentioned as the last sacrifice in the Gavam Ayana section.
10.3.7	And what is mentioned without reference to any part of the sacrifice cannot be a part of it, just as the Rathantara is not a part of the Jyotiṣṭoma.
10.3.8	In the two Atiratra sacrifices, the Sodashin is not prescribed. If it is performed, it may be done there where Viraj is found. This is the opinion of the teachers. It is done in the Dva-dash-aha, not in the Gavam-ayana. There it is found thus.
10.3.9	But the existence of Viraj is not the cause. Many Virajas are found. And there is no cause for the prescription of the unseen.
10.3.10	But in the case of the Atiratra, it is as one pleases. Therefore, here also it would be the same.
10.3.11	But the injunction and prohibition are for the purpose of restriction.
10.3.12	In the previous thirteen-night (Soma-sacrifice), the Chandomas are stretched out, because of the Soma-samadheśa and the absence of the Gaurivit.
10.3.13	It proceeds thus because the Prsthya is cut off by the Gavāmayana method.
10.3.14	Like the ten-night (sacrifice), because of non-distinction.
10.3.15	Because of the presence of the proper metre.
10.3.16	Because of the arrangement of the Sama.
10.3.17	And because the Prāṇāyāma is at the beginning, as in the Prāṇasūtra, for this is in accordance with the Prāṇāsūtra.
10.3.18	And because it is seen that the tenth meaning is not excluded.
10.3.19	And because of the combination of nine.
10.3.20	Gautama says that in the case of night-long sacrifices, the repetition of the Abhiplava is like the Samvatsara-grahaṇa.
10.3.21	Others say that the Trayastrimsa night shows the cessation of the northern ones.
10.4.1	Of the five days that have been repeated, the first day of the first five days is the Brihatī of the Manavadi, and it should be the Santani.
10.4.2	But there is cessation due to the modification.
10.4.3	In the five days, one should not proceed in the Abhiplva.
10.4.4	Some perform the five-day Pañchahas, without the instruction, because of the assumption of the original form, and because of the similarity of the Vaisvajit and Anuvakya, because of the difference in the Brahma-saman, because of the omission of the sixth from the Pañchahas (i.e. the Vaisva-jit), because of the statement of the Jyotis, Gaura and Ayus, and because of not being instructed. They end with the Trivrit and begin with the Trivrt.
10.4.5	These are equal.
10.4.6	The five-day sacrifice is the only one. Gautama is the only one who is mentioned in the sacrifices. The others are not seen.
10.4.7	And why is the practice of this natural five-day sacrifice?
10.4.8	The Jyotiragaurayu, the Jyotiragaura, the five-day sacrifice, that is the second, that is the third, and the Parabrahmaṇa.
10.4.9	This is the Pratipañcaha for the Pratipaṃcaha of the Pratipaṅkti.
10.4.10	In the Upaṣats of the Garhapatya, the offerings of clarified butter are made separately with the fragrances of the gods as mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa.
10.4.11	At the time of the Sutyā-sūpakarana, they sat down to the east of the Havirdhāna, and anointed themselves with oil.
10.4.12	Gautama says that one should eat at the Agnīdhriya alone.
10.4.13	The sequence has been mentioned by the Brāhmaṇa.
10.4.14	Dhananjaya and Śāṇḍilī say that this should be done every day.
10.4.15	Gautama (says that) it should be done with all Stotras.
10.4.16	Some say that it should be done in the Prsthya.
10.5.1	The first of the year-long sacrifices is the Prāyaniya lasting for ten nights, some say. But it should be the Trivṛt alone, for that is what is said.
10.5.2	Having prescribed the Prāyaniyī, he takes up the Stomavikāra for it.
10.5.3	There is no use of the parts of the ten-night sacrifices.
10.5.4	The teacher says that the fourth month of the year should be the Sarva-varna month, for the sake of the benefit of the Samvatsarika substance.
10.5.5	The fourth month of the leap year is omitted, and it should be taken with it, just as the back takes the womb.
10.5.6	The Sanatani is used before, because of the correctness of repetition.
10.5.7	The Yajus would be in the case of the rites performed after the Upasads. In the former case, it would be before the rites performed after them.
10.5.8	This has been stated in the Ekashashti-atra.
10.5.9	In the Shata-atra, the rites are performed in the manner of Abhipraiya and Abhi-sunvanti. The rites are performed in a similar manner. This is an option.
10.5.10	The rites are performed in such a manner that they are performed in the Sarvasvata-atra.
10.5.11	Where, however, there is a place,
10.5.12	or in the same place, as in the case of others, they should not go.
10.5.13	The teachers say that the wheels should be turned at the end of the day after making the sacrificial posts with wheels. Those who are going to that place should turn the wheels, and those who are not going should sprinkle the same place.
10.5.14	Dhananjaya and Shandilya say that this should be done every day.
10.5.15	Gautama says that it is to be done in the Abhiplāva months.
10.5.16	Some say that it is to done in the Trikadruka months.
10.5.17	The initiation at the time mentioned is for the Brāhmaṇas in the Gomayaṇa.
10.5.18	Vaisakha and Jyestha are optional, with the Caitra fortnight and Asādha.
10.5.19	Or having initiated on the sixth, they should perform the initiation for seventeen days.
10.5.20	This is said for those who do not have a specific instruction, for those who are annual.
10.6.1	The Barhīta Prastāras are to be employed in the five Māsas. Thus it is seen that the Stotras are repeated. The Brāhmaṇa Sāman is heard in the context.
10.6.2	And the statement “one Prastāra after another” shows that the Prastāras are different.
10.6.3	There are four hundred Barhīta Indra Prastāras in the Dasatīya stoma.
10.6.4	They are the Bṛhat, Rathantara, Kāleya, Stotra and Indra Kratu.
10.6.5	One hundred and twenty-one should be done in the fourth Pravargya. The others should be done in Abhiplvas.
10.6.6	Thirty-nine verses are to be recited in the Sata-barhiṣ.
10.6.7	One verse each should be recited on the third day of each Pravargya. They have been done in this place according to the rules of the Ārsheya.
10.6.8	In the fifth month, on the fifth day of the bright fortnight, one should perform the Stobhrī verses.
10.6.9	When they have been mastered, one should join them with the metres. In the sixth month, one should add a Gāyatrī foot to each verse, for otherwise there would be a deficiency.
10.6.10	Gautama says that the remaining eight are to be made by combining them.
10.6.11	Because the Brihatī is obtained by subtracting, it is said thus.
10.6.12	It is said that one should compose with only four additional metres. Gautama says that one should compose the Gāyatrī in the twenty-fourth, the Uṣṇīṣa in the first Ābhiplava, the Anuṣṭubh in the second, and the Brihatī in the others.
10.6.13	But he should recite the Brihatis from the fifth day, for the Pragaathas are indeed predominant.
10.6.14	There, having made the Paṅktis, on the sixth day.
10.6.15	The Tristubh went to the sixth month.
10.6.16	But the Jagati in the third Svarasani.
10.6.17	The nine Sātobarhiṣa verses and the two Prathas, having made them into a Paṅkti, they should proceed to them. And in the place of the best of them, above that, the Tristubh. So says Gautama.
10.7.1	One should do it with the Brihatī and the Tristubh verses. One should make the Tristubh verse in the twenty-fourth (verse) and the Brihatī in the first Ābhiplava.
10.7.2	This is the reversal in all the Ayana.
10.7.3	These are the great varieties.
10.7.4	The four-plus-one application is the reversal of the Brihatī and Tristubh meters. The sixth month should be so. This is the practice of purity. It is said, "This is like a sharp-edged weapon among the meters," and in that he establishes it.
10.7.5	The teachers say that it is in all. For one who employs the four extra verses in succession, the Brihatī is recited in the middle. And it is said that the sixth month is in the Tristubh.
10.7.6	And because of the Brihatī being exhausted, the alternation with the Brihatī does not apply.
10.7.7	She went to the Brihatī Grahaṇa. The Śauci-Vṛṣṭi said, "The Tristubh." As there was more discussion, the Brihatīs were not exhausted.
10.7.8	The remaining eight from the Satobārhata are the Brihat, Rathantara, and Kāleya Stotrīyās. One should alternate them with the Tristubh.
10.7.9	The Tarani is the time of the sun's setting. If there is a stotra in the Abhivarta of the Tarani, then it should be done in the Kalayani.
10.7.10	If the stotra is in the Rathantera, then it should not be done in the Abhivarti. The teachers have explained it thus.
10.7.11	Even if there are twenty hundred verses, they are not recited. One should use them only for the purpose of stopping, because there is a stoppage at four hundred.
10.7.12	There, he should perform the Brihatī Stotras in the same way.
10.7.13	But he should omit the fifth day.
10.7.14	The order of the Stotras is reversed again, because the performance was done in the wrong order. The Brihatī, Rathantara, and Kālāya Stotras are performed again.
10.8.1	There are twenty-one hundred Stotras left. He should alternate them with seven Sātobhṛju Stotras and four Rathantara Stotras.
10.8.2	The Triṃśat-sūktas, etc., are to be used in the twenty-four Sāmans, and the Uttara-sāman is to be used in connection with the Svarasāman. This is what the teachers say. For in the Abhivarta-section it is heard that this is Abhivarta.
10.8.3	But if it is done without this, then the six-verse section should be done according to the Ārsheya-kalpa.
10.8.4	If they occur on the third day when they are used together, then one should perform them there.
10.8.5	If they do not occur, then they should be used as Prāgāthas, because it is improper to use them on the sixth day other than the third day.
10.8.6	Now, as he would perform the Stotriya in the same manner as before, so he would perform the Brahma-saman with the Nidhanas in the Indrakata. Thus it is done according to the rules of the Arsheyaka.
10.8.7	The sixth month together with the two Atiratras and the twenty-four (saman) is performed in the first half of the month. The two Atiratras are performed in the first (half) and the twenty-fours in the second.
10.8.8	Now, as to these Sāman-chants, they do not fall away. The Nihav and the Syamavasva of Gaurīvit are to be used everywhere. For the Syamavasya is not begun, and the Nihav is not ended. So say some.
10.8.9	But the Nihav and the Nihav of Gaurīvita and Syamavasva are performed according to the rules of the Veda. Thus there is no falling away.
10.9.1	All the priests should chant together with the great vow. This would be a modification of the Udgātṛ, because others are not heard.
10.9.2	And the word "all" is obtained only in them.
10.9.3	Since the chanting would be done in sequence due to the coordination of the action and the sequential injunction, the chanting would be in sequence.
10.9.4	The Udgātṛ, by means of the three, shows that the praise is inferior to himself.
10.9.5	The praise of the various countries is for the Chandogas only. The Udgātṛ alone should sing, for it has been said that he should sing. Having praised with the head at the Havirdhāna, they should go back to the east, having gone around the Dhishnyas on the right, and sit down at the back of the Maitrāvaruṇa Dhishnya. This shows that the others should praise those who praise with the head.
10.9.6	The Ilandam is to be sung at the Agniṣṭoma. The verse "O Agni, may we be in thy hearing" is to be sung in the first three of these.
10.9.7	In the ten-syllabled verses, the Anugānas are to be sung in accordance with the Arcikas. Thus it becomes in the three-syllabled (verses).
10.9.8	The Ācārya says that in the six-syllabled, it is to be sung everywhere. In the half-syllabled ones, the Anugānās are to be sung. Thus the singing is more unobstructed.
10.9.9	Śāṇḍilī says that there are twelve verses. There he should recite two verses to Agni, namely, "For you, O Agni" and "That Agni, indeed, is the mind." The verses are to be recited in this order.
10.9.10	The fourth is the Anugā. The Trica would be so. Here Varsaganya says that the Nidhanavāda is Vratam. It becomes Svar. It becomes Shakun. Thus the Bhaktīs are determined. And one recites them together, as in the case of the different Samavedas.
10.10.1	Some say that the Triṃśa should be the tenth of the Agniṣṭoma Sāman at the tenth day of the Cāturmāsya and the Madhu sacrifice.
10.10.2	The Trika and the Sarpārajña are the tenth part of the Cātumāsa.
10.10.3	The Rk and Sāman are mentioned as the fourth part of the Cāturmāsa, because the entire day is mentioned in the Cāturmāsya.
10.10.4	And the modification of the direct perception is like the statement of the majority.
10.10.5	And in the Brāhmaṇa prescribed for the Stoma, there is a section on the Kalpa, which is about the Rk and Sāman verses.
10.10.6	They should mention the thirty-one Soma sacrifices in all places, and also the Kauṇḍapāyina and Hāviyajña sacrifices, and the Daikṣopasads.
10.10.7	The two Ayanas of the Sun, when it is in the Dṛti and Vāta constellations, are the two months of Sunaṃyu, consisting of three Vṛttis each. So says Gautama.
10.10.8	The two months of the Sun, in the Dṛtis and Vātas, are the two Trīṃśas. So says Dhānajāpya.
10.10.9	The two Trīṃsas may be the same. So says this Brāhmaṇa.
10.10.10	If this is so, then having initiated on the eighth day, they would perform the initiation on the fifteenth.
10.10.11	The Acharya says that the Utkhas should be the tenth of the fifteen, and the Ashtadantras should be the end.
10.10.12	But there should be no cessation due to non-mention, as in the case of other Samas.
10.10.13	And the reason for the cessation of the Narmadha is the mention, not the Sodashi.
10.10.14	And the Sodashi is seen frequently in the non-Sodashi.
10.10.15	Some say that the months are observed in the order of the Prsthya Stoma.
10.10.16	Sandilya says that it is done in the order of Prsthya stoma.
10.10.17	Saucivrati says that it is in the order of Abhiplava and Prsthya.
10.10.18	Sandilyayana and Dhananjaya say that it is done by each day of Prsthyas.
10.10.19	Lamkayana says that it is by Jyotis toma. His Prstha is Rathantara and Brihat in alternate order.
10.10.20	As it is stated in the Arsheya Kalpa, so says Kshirakalambhi.
10.11.1	The consecrations beginning with the full moon are of Kaundapayana.
10.11.2	Having performed the Upasadant and Upvasathakarma, they should proceed to the Atiratra. This is how the practice is followed by Shandilya.
10.11.3	Then, from that day onwards, they should offer the morning oblations and conclude with the evening oblation for thirty-one days.
10.11.4	Gautama says that the Soma sacrifices should be performed for a month. The Upvasatha rite should be performed before the Soma sacrifices. The Atiratra should be performed in this way. Thus, the continuity of the Haviyajna Soma sacrifices is maintained without interruption.
10.11.5	Because of the non-hearing of the Atiratra, it would not be there. Dhananjaya, having raised the question at the end of the Upavasatha rite, does not prescribe it here.
10.11.6	The Upavasatha rites should be performed at the end of them.
10.11.7	After the eighteen Saunaasirya rites, they should buy the king. Thus it would be after the Sutya rites.
10.11.8	The Sandilyāyana view is that the Soma-purchasing is to be done after the initiation and the Upasads. The text "They purchase Soma in the month" shows that the purchasing is to be done immediately after the initiation.
10.11.9	The Upasthaka rite should be done immediately after Sutyā.
10.11.10	Having taken the embers from the Agnidhra-chamber, having cooked the oblations separately in the Marjālīya vessel, they should perform the Pitryajña.
10.11.11	Then they should offer the Dakṣiṇā in the Paiṭṛyajña.
10.11.12	To the south of the Āhavanīya, in the Varuṇapraghāsa, they should perform the rites that are to be performed in the Dakṣiṇa Āhavanīya. If the Upavasatha rite has been performed,
10.11.13	it should be performed according to the prescribed procedure.
10.11.14	If the rites are performed in the Agnihotra month, the Adhvaryu should offer the food of the initiated, and the others should join in.
10.11.15	The offerings should be made in the Iṣṭi.
10.12.1	Śāṇḍilī says that the Agnihotra-upasthāna, Viṣṇukrama, and Samīṣṭayajūṃṣī should not be performed, as they are not part of the Avabhrtha.
10.12.2	But the Samidh should be performed, as mentioned earlier.
10.12.3	Dhananjaya says that everything should be performed.
10.12.4	The month is to be completed by the New and Full Moon sacrifices. The New Moon sacrifice is to be performed in the waning fortnight and the Full Moon sacrifice in the waxing fortnight.
10.12.5	Gautama says that the New Moon sacrifice should be performed once and not again.
10.12.6	Sāṇḍilī says that it should not be performed once and again.
10.12.7	Dhānajāpya says that it should be performed every day.
10.12.8	Having performed the Saṃgrahaṇī rites for a month, they should establish the remaining (rites) on the same day. Thus they would have performed the rites thirty times.
10.12.9	In the original procedure, they should practise the rites only fifteen times, as they are exempted from the rites for two days. That is a month.
10.12.10	The Adhvaryus who know the Agnihotra rites as the Daśahotāra rites perform the Agnihotra rites.
10.12.11	The priests are to be selected from the north.
10.12.12	Those who pronounce the Vasat-call are to be employed at the sacrifice.
10.12.13	They should eat from the cups which are like the Kundas.
10.12.14	The Hotr has been described in the Brahmana.
10.12.15	The Brahma-priest should be employed from the seat of the Hotr to the seat of the Brahma-priest.
10.12.16	Similarly the Udgata, Prastotar and Agnidhra should be employed.
10.12.17	The householder is the householder, Subrahmaṇya is Subrahmaṇyā. Thus he shows the non-coalescence of the two.
10.13.1	By this, the initiation etc. of Tapasci is stated.
10.13.2	The deliberations on the Ayana (i.e., the path of the sun) are as follows:
10.13.3	The Jyotiṣṭoma, Atiratra and Ṣoḍaśi should be performed daily, says Dhānajāpya.
10.13.4	The four Jyotishtoma sacrifices, the Abhijit sacrifice, the five-day sacrifice, the Mahavrata sacrifice, the Visuva sacrifice, and the eight-day sacrifice are performed in the six months. The same months are repeated, with the Vishvajit sacrifice replacing the Abhijit sacrifice. This is the path of Narayana.
10.13.5	The Abhijit sacrifice is performed every day. The Jyotishtoma sacrifice with the Rathantara chant is of Agni.
10.13.6	The Brihat chant is of Indra.
10.13.7	The Brihat and Rathantara are the two Prsthas of Indra and Agni.
10.13.8	The Brahmaprajapati has both Sama.
10.13.9	The Vairupa Prstha of Vayu is the Vrata.
10.13.10	The Viraja Prstha of Aditya is the Visvajit.
10.13.11	The Sarkari Prstha of the Waters.
10.13.12	The Revati Prstha of Cows.
10.13.13	The Vamadevya Prstha of Prajapati.
10.13.14	The Svaraprstha of all the Gods.
10.13.15-18	The Sūrya-sūkta is the Prstha of the Divākirti-sūkta. The Mahendra-sūkta has the Mahāvrata-sūkta as its Prstha. The three northern (sūktas) in the Jyotiṣṭoma have the Rathantara-sūkta and the Brihat-sūkta alternately as their Prstha. This is as stated in the Arṣeyakalpa. Thus says Kṣairakalaṃbha.
10.14.1-3	The Agniṣṭomas are to be performed with three Stotras. The Parīṣṭiṣṭoma is to be performed at the end. Since there is no mention of the Atiratras, they should not be performed. The Viṣuvat should be performed in the middle. This is the view of Śāṇḍilya. The other view is that the Atiratras should be performed on both sides of the Viṣuvat, which should be performed in between. The Viṣuvant should be performed with the Brihat and Rathantara stotras. The Madhyandin should be performed with fifteen stotras, and the Prātaḥsavan with seventeen stotras.
10.14.4	Each of these would be a class of a year.
10.14.5	The best (year) would be the best (year).
10.14.6	Or in the separate years.
10.14.7	They would be the equinoctial days according to the number of stomas.
10.14.8	The Rathantara-saman would be the Brhat-saman, the Trivrt-saman would have the Brihat-saman as the background, the Rathantara-soman as the midday, and the others as the background.
10.14.9	If the birth of a child occurs on the day of sacrifice, if it is in the bright fortnight, then if the half-months are not equal to the equinox, then it is in the odd half-months.
10.14.10	In the dark fortnights.
10.14.11	The teachers say that the thousand-savya is with the two Atiratras. The days are a thousand. Because it is said to be the thousand-savyas.
10.14.12	Śaucivrīṣi says that the Atiratra is performed in between.
10.14.13	The option of the Ayana is the Trikarduka, the Catuṣṣaṣṭi, the Śatābhī, and the Dasātra Vrata. The Dasātra Vratam is performed.
10.15.1	Gautama says that they should be initiated on the southern bank of the Sarasvati at Vinashana, on the ṣaṣṭī day of the fortnight for the sake of the Sarasvati.
10.15.2	The Atiratra should be performed on the new-moon day. Thus the new-moon sacrifice is performed in its own place.
10.15.3	Or, having initiated on the seventh day, the Atiratra should take place on the day of the new-moon offering. This is the view of Dhananjaya.
10.15.4	The Soma sacrifices are concluded with the two subsequent days.
10.15.5	And the new-moon ceremony is performed in its proper place.
10.15.6	Because the new-moon place is in the bright fortnight.
10.15.7	At the end of the Atiratra, they should offer the evening milking. At the end of that, they should offer morning milking with that milk-rice.
10.15.8	Having performed the Sannāyya sacrifice, the Adhvaryu should throw the dice towards the Āhavanīya fire. Standing facing east, he should always throw the dice at the conclusion of the Iṣṭi. This is stated in the Brāhmaṇa.
10.15.9	The sacrificial post, the altar, the shed for the wife, and the shed for the fire-wood shall be placed in their proper places.
10.15.10	If the ground is level, they shall be placed in the proper places.
10.15.11	In an uneven ground, they shall be arranged in order.
10.15.12	The ashes of the Veda shall be removed, and the ashes from the Dhishnya altars.
10.15.13	Having settled down, they shall be scattered in their respective places.
10.15.14	The sacrificial post is the mortar-pestle. The post with a broad base would be the mortar-pestles.
10.15.15	"They should draw it forward, and then they should lift it up."
10.15.16	"It should be placed in a raised position, and it should be covered with sand."
10.15.17	The Uparava-bricks are not to be dug in. The Ashvabhra-bricks are to be placed below the Uparava- bricks. They should be drawn but not dug in.
10.16.1	The Goṣṭoma-stotra is to be performed on the full-moon day. This is to be done on the day of the Yajniya-stotra. The Acharya says that the Goṣṭoma is to be performed after the completion of the full-moon sacrifice. This is because the Goṣṭomayajña is to be performed at the end of the full- moon sacrifice.
10.16.2	They are called the full-moon and new-moon days because they are filled and diminished.
10.16.3	But it is only on the full-moon day and the new-moon day that they are called the full moon and new moon, for the Lord himself has declared this in the Veda.
10.16.4	The cessation of the rites of the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices is merely the cessation of the rites.
10.16.5	They are called the full and new moon because they are filled or diminished.
10.16.6	If the Goṣṭoma sacrifice is concluded on the full-moon day, they should offer the sacrifice with the full-moon oblation on that very day.
10.16.7	Gautama says that those who do not offer the sacrifice should stay there for that night.
10.16.8	Śāṇḍilya says that they should offer the full-moon sacrifice on the next day.
10.16.9	This explains the life span.
10.16.10	There, at the new moon, they should milk the evening milking before the morning milking, for the Dhananjaya.
10.16.11	"The Sāṇḍilāyana says, "If the cooked rice has been kept too long, they should do either of the other two."
10.16.12	The Kauṇḍapāyina says, "Food is mentioned in the rites of the Iṣṭi. The rites of the Darśa-Paurṇamāsa are mentioned."
10.16.13	On the Parvas, they should be of the size of the moon.
10.17.1	If the Drishadvati river is without water, they should perform the Apampatriya Iṣṭi.
10.17.2	If it is without water, Dhananjaya says:
10.17.3	If there are a hundred cows, they should offer a bull. If there are a hundred pregnant cows, they should do the same.
10.17.4	They should protect them where there is no danger from cows.
10.17.5	The bulls of those (cows) should be fed with ghee.
10.17.6	When a thousand cows have been completed in the first half, having performed the Atiratra of cows, they should be given and these should be raised.
10.17.7	When all the enemies are conquered, then there is authority over them alone, because of being the subject matter. There, the Vishvajit Atiratra is performed.
10.17.8	When the householder dies, life.
10.17.9	From the end of the appearance of these two calamities, they may rise even in the dark fortnight.
10.17.10	They should never bathe in the Sarasvati river, because it is the place of worship of the gods.
10.17.11	If the Sarasvati river is not present, they should take the Uddhara ritual from the side.
10.17.12	When they come to Prāsravana, the place of the Plaksa tree, they should rise. So says Gautama.
10.17.13	When they come to any place of rising, they should rise and perform the Atiratra sacrifice. So says Dhananjaya.
10.17.14	Having reached Prāsaravana, a sacrifice to Agni Kama should be performed before the Atiratra. This is the opinion of Shandilya.
10.17.15	It should be performed afterwards, says Dhananjaya.
10.17.16	In that (sacrifice) they should give to a suitable person a horse, a woman, a cow, and the remaining sacrificial requisites.
10.17.17	For all the owners do not have the right to accept (gifts) at the Sattras.
10.17.18	The Avabhrtha has been described in the Brāhmaṇa.
10.17.19	This is the reply to the question that was not asked.
10.18.1	The same applies to the subsequent ones.
10.18.2	There, the Iṣṭi to Agni Kāma and the Apomnaptrya Sruvahoma should be performed.
10.18.3	If it is above the Atiratra, then the Iṣṭhi to Agni Kāma alone, says Śāṇḍilya.
10.18.4	Indrakukshi at the Parvan.
10.18.5	Gautama says that the two Agniṣṭoma sacrifices in the eastern half of the month are to be performed with the Trivṛt and Rāthantara Sāman, and the Ukthya sacrifice with the Pañcadaśa and Rāthantara Sāman. The two Agniṣṭomas in the western half of the month should be performed with the Pañcaviṃśa and Rathantara Sāman.
10.18.6	One should not move from one half of the month to the other.
10.18.7	But in all cases, the Trivṛta and Pañcadaśasāman should be alternated.
10.18.8	If a festival falls on the day when one of these two is not to be performed, one should begin the next half of the month with that.
10.18.9	This is what is said in the Upakrama of the Trikakudaka.
10.18.10	The observances of the Dārsha and Paurnamāsa sacrifices.
10.18.11	One should stand during the day, sleep at night, eat the remnants of the oblations, lie down on the ground, eat without meat or salt, not approach a woman, and live according to the rules of the person who has abandoned the sacred fire.
10.18.12	For a year, one should protect the cow of a brahmin who is observing the vow of Dārṣa. Or of a teacher who is a ritualist.
10.18.13	The Marmas of the Naiṣadhavas are in Sarasvati. One of them is a single syllable. For a year, he should kindle the fire in that. The service of the one-fire is done by that.
10.18.14	If the one who offers Agnihotra is a householder, he should offer before the one who has kindled the fire.
10.19.1	After a year, one should perform the Prāṇayāma rite on the Prāṇāyāma day, and then perform the Anvarambhaṇīya rite and proceed. This is said by Śāṇḍilī.
10.19.2	One should perform the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices. This is said in Dhānajapy.
10.19.3	If one is a householder, one should offer oblations in the evening and morning, and then perform Anvarambhaṇa.
10.19.4	Having reached the confluence of the Sarasvati and the Drishadvati, one should undertake to perform a sacrifice with eight pot-shaped oblations in the Agniyeṣṭi.
10.19.5	Here, the throwing of the dice is as in the Sārasvata rites.
10.19.6	But one should not proceed from the prescribed order.
10.19.7	One may establish several Iṣṭis in a single day.
10.19.8	One should go along the southern bank of the Drishadvatī.
10.19.9	Having reached the sacred place of her, one should perform the Iṣṭi and then go to Yamunā for the Avabhṛtha rite, taking three leaves.
10.19.10	Wherever Yamunā may be, even if far away, one should perform this Iṣṭi there and then go to the Avabhṛta rite, singing the Sāman oneself or not singing.
10.19.11	The going of one who is about to renounce the world is considered to be this. The Dhānajāpya says, "It becomes invisible to humans."
10.19.12	"One should not return to the village again."
10.19.13	One ascends to heaven.
10.19.14	One turns away, becomes better, or so it is said.
10.19.15	Or like the disappearance of water, as in the case of dust.
10.20.1	One should offer a sacrifice every day for a year with the Taura mantra.
10.20.2	On the sixth day of the bright fortnight of Caitra, having eaten the oblation-food, having shaved the hair and beard, having put on a new garment, having surrounded the fires, having led the Praṇītā oblations, having tied the girdle, having taken the staff in hand, having sat behind the Garhapatya fire, one should himself spread the Kṛṣṇājina silently.
10.20.3	Having gone round the Ahavaniya from the west and having crossed it from the south, one should do this.
10.20.4	Of that, three Iṣṭis are in the forenoon, one separately in the midday and the afternoon.
10.20.5	When they are performed separately, the oblations mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa are in order.
10.20.6	There may be only one. In that, all of them should be there.
10.20.7	After a year, one should perform the Avabhrtha ceremony. The chanting of the Sama Veda should be done as in the previous one.
10.20.8	But if one rises from both Avabhrtha ceremonies, then one should perform the Isti ceremony before the Soma sacrifice.
10.20.9	One should perform the Soma sacrifice with as many animals as there are oblations before the Isti ceremony.
10.20.10	The two, Saṇḍa and Kuṣaṇḍa, are mentioned as Abhigarā and Apagarā.
10.20.11	But in this case, the inference is not found, as it is directly stated in the Ārṣeyaka Kalpa.
10.20.12	Abhigarā and Apagara should be on the Upoddhatahani day.
10.20.13	The Pūrṇamāsa is the source of the three-year-long (ritual).
10.20.14	For that, the initiation is optional.
10.20.15	Śāṇḍilya says sixty.
10.20.16	Some say that one should omit the first and the best of the years. For the purpose of ascending the Stoma and the Prsthya, it is said.
10.20.17	One should follow the prescribed procedure.
10.20.18	In the year of a thousand sacrifices, one should perform the New Moon sacrifice.

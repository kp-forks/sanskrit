1.1-5	He should reply to the Soma-seller who has come, "You have told me the greatness, you have told me the prosperity, you have told the fame." Then he says, "Did you not sell it to someone else?" "Did you not sell to someone else?" "Did others employ you to perform the sacrifice?" "What is the fee?"
1.6-11	He should examine the three things, namely, birth, action and the officiating priests. The sacrificer should examine these things about the officiating priests. Here they say, "Who is the one who is not deficient?" They say, "The Atiratra is the first one who is notdeficient." Because in that (sacrifice) there is no deficiency of day and night. There is no doubt about this.
1.12-17	One should not perform a sacrifice without a designated officiating priest. But if the village is within the shadow of a dead body, this sacrifice is within the shadow, if it is without a designated officiating priest." One should not perform a rite for which the officiating priest has been appointed. "If the officiating priest of the previous rite were to appoint (another), he would say, 'This is the officiating priest of this rite." "If it is appointed, then by this alone." "Who performs the sacrifice?"
1.18-23	One who is not a student should not be employed as a student, one who has no relatives should not be employed for a relative, one who has not performed good deeds should not be employed to perform good deeds. One who is born black should not be employed. One who has committed a sin should not be employed One should not employ one who has committed a crime with one who has committed crimes. What is the fee?
1.24-27	Śāṭyāyanīya says, "One should not ask for Dakṣiṇās." This is the form of sale. Tāṇḍya says, "Ask for Dakṣiņās." The sacrifice is fruitful because of Dakṣiṇā.
1.28	The sacrificer himself now runs forward for the distribution of food.
2.1	Now they bring a seat for him.
2.2	He sits on it.
2.3	He pushes aside the grass with the verse, "O Dādhīci, stand here and sit in the house of him who is better than us. Sit in the house of the one who is better than him. The one who is excluded is Parāvasu." He pushes aside the grass if it has dried up or if it has been cut.
2.4	Having touched water, he sits down with the words, "I sit down in the abode of Vasu."
2.5	Then they bring water for him.
2.6	He receives it with the words, “May there be radiance in me, may there be prosperity, may there be the juice of the sacrifice, may Parameshthin Prajapati firmly establish me in heaven, as heaven is established in heaven."
2.7	Then they offer honey to him.
2.8-13	He eats it with four fingers, including the thumb. He eats it three times, saying, "You are honey, may I be honey-like." Then they bring him clothes. "You are glory, may I be glorious." They bring him garlands and ornaments, saying, "This is for the stream."
2.14	He chooses him as adorned, Parjanya is my Udgātṛ, he is my Udgätṛ, you are my Udgātā, the directions are my Prastotar and Pratihātar, Subrahmaṇya.
2.15	He instructs him in a low voice.
2.16	The Udgātṛ is the lord of Parjanya. He is the Udgātṛ. I am the Udgātā. The directions are your Prastôtṛ and Pratihârtṛ. Subrahmaṇya is the Karma. We shall perform the Karma.
2.17	Oṃ, thus loudly.
2.18	Then he requests him for the Devayajana: "O Udgātṛ, give me the Devayajna."
2.19	He replies in a low voice: "So be it."
2.20	Oṃ, only loudly.
2.21	Then they offer a cow to him who has settled down.
2.22	When the cow is killed, it is sin that is killed.
2.23	If one were to release a cow, one should release it with this (verse): "The cow, the giver of gifts, the mother of the Rudras, the daughter of the Vasus, the sister of the Adityas, the navel of immortality."
2.24	Do I speak to the people who are seeking a remedy? Do not kill the cow, the non-cow, Aditi. Drink water, eat grass. Om, let it be released.
3.1	When the king is bought, they invite Subrahmanya.
3.2	Having put on the sacrificial thread, having sipped water, with the right hand he takes a Palāśa branch or a Śamī branch, and standing between the wheel and the chariot, and approaching the right yoke of the chariot, he calls out to the Subrahmaṇya three times in an indistinct voice.
3.3	"O Subrahmaṇya, O Subrahmaṇy, O Subrahmanya!" thus in a low voice.
3.4	In the same way, facing east, then south, then north.
3.5	He touches the right bull twice with a branch, and the left one once.
3.6	They drive the king's chariot around.
3.7	They lead the king to the released bulls.
3.8	When the king has entered, he enters the hall through the eastern door and takes shelter under the branch in the north, saying, "Protect the sacrificer's cattle."
3.9	Here he gives this unyoked (cart) to the Subrahmanya.
3.10	They perform the Atithyas.
3.11	Having performed the Atithyas, they perform the Pravargya and Upavasatha rites.
3.12	When the heap of earth has been placed, standing near it, he calls out three times the Subrahmaṇyā verse.
3.13	O Indra, O Hara, O Medhatithi, O Mese, O Vrusanasvasya, O Gauramaskandinn, O Jar, O Kausika, O Brahman, O Kausika who speaks, O Sutiya, O Maghavan, O Gods, O Brahmans, come, come, come.
3.14	Having called, he makes the sacrificer recite in the Subrahmanya (hymn).
3.15	"Brahmāsi, Subrahmaṇya, the earth is her foot, Agni is her calf. With that, do thou, O thou who art milking, milk the nourishing (milk) for me."
3.16	"Brahmāsi, Su-Brahmaṇya, space is her foot, Vāyu is her calf. Do thou, O thou that art milking, milk for me the nourishing (milk)."
3.17	Brahma, thou art Subrahmanya. The sky is her foot, the sun her calf. Therewith do thou, O Brahma, Subrahmanya, milk for me the nourishing food of her who is dripping.
3.18	Brahma, thou art Subrahamanya. The directions are her foot, the intermediate directions her calf. There with do thou, O Brahina, Subrahmanya,
3.19	"Brahmāsi, Subrahmaṇya, Paroraja, thy fifth foot is the ocean, thy breast the moon, thy calf the sun. With that do thou milk for me the strength of my cattle, my progeny, heaven, the world, for the sacrificer. Do thou milk." So in a low voice.
3.20	In the same way at the evening Upasad when it is over.
3.21	He continues the same rites as on the day of fasting.
4.5	"Bhuva" on the middle one.
4.6	"Svar" on the highest one.
4.7	He worships the accumulated Agni with the Sama hymns.
4.8	"Agna ayusam pavasah" (RV. 10.189.1) - in these (verses) the body is like the Shirsha Gāyatrī. By the Rathantara, the right wing; by the Brihat, the left wing; by the Rtu-sthā, the tail; by the Yajñāyajñiya, the left shoulder; by the Vāravantiya, the right shoulder; by the Shaiteya, the left shoulder. By the Prajapati Hridaya, the right wing. By the Agni Vrata, the left wing. By the Agnirka, the head. By the Vamadevya, the self.
4.9	Here the fire becomes tranquil.
4.10	Here the Udgātṛ gives a boon.
5.1	Having dismissed the Pravargya, they then invite him.
5.2	Having put on the sacrificial thread and sipped water, he becomes inseparable from it.
5.3	When the Adhvaryu instructs him, "O Prastôtṛ, sing the Sâman," he utters the Stobha at each step.
5.4	All of them, with their wives, go to their final end.
5.5	At this time the gods and the demons were contending.
5.6	He saw this Agni Raksha-destroying Sama.
5.7	With it he destroyed the demons.
5.8	In that all of them go to their final destination, it is for the destruction of the demons.
5.9	They take up the Prati-sthapam three times.
5.10	He sings at each Prati-sthapit.
5.11	These are the three worlds.
5.12	For the support of these worlds.
5.13	They yoke the Pravargya while standing in another place.
5.14	When he sprinkles the water for the second time, then he says to the Prastotar, "Sing the Sama."
5.15	He sings the Varsahara three times with the sound "hi."
5.16	Standing here itself, he sings the Ishtahotra three times with the "hi" sound.
5.17	They perform the Iṣṭi-Hotr's Nidhana, not that of Vārṣāhara.
5.18	Then the Prastotar takes up that with which the wife is covered.
5.19	One should sing while returning to Śyait.
6.1	When they pour out the Dhishnyas, then taking the ladle with clarified butter, having gone around on the north of the Agnidhra and the Sadasi, and having entered the Sadasi through the western door, he approaches the Udumbara.
6.2	"I place you in the abode, in the shade of the ocean, in the heart of the ocean."
6.3	"Salutations to the ocean, salutations to the vision of the ocean." "
6.4	"Do not let me be deprived of your union."
6.5	Then he raises it, saying, "Thou art raised above heaven, thou fillest the atmosphere, thou spreadest over the earth."
6.6	"Thou art raised above the earth."
6.7	Then he presses it down, saying,
6.8	"May the wind-god press thee down, on the firm law of Mitra-Varuna." Then he offers it with ghee, saying,
6.9	Having taken it from the front, as if spreading ghee from the root, you should anoint the heaven and earth, and make the plants very tender. Svāhā.
6.10	Then he encloses it three times with cowdung.
6.11	"I enclose you in the abode of Brahman, in the abode of the Kshatriya, in the abode for good progeny, in the abode that nourishes wealth."
6.12	Then he presses it down with the staff of the initiated.
6.13	"Firm the Brahman, firm the Kshatra, firm the progeny, firm the wealth, firm the prosperity of wealth, firm the kinsmen for the sacrificer."
6.14	Then he encloses her with grass having their tips pointing upwards, moving clockwise.
6.15	Then he covers her with a cloth, for non-burning.
6.16	Then he grasps her with both hands.
6.17	"Place the food in me."
6.18	In this way, he takes it up at each praise.
7.1	Having led the Agni-Soma (fire and Soma), one offers the Agni-Soma animal sacrifice.
7.2	Standing on the heap of grass where the animal is being offered, he calls out to the Subrahmanya, the father and daughter.
7.3	"The Brahman of Kausika, the one who speaks of Kausika."
7.4	Having uttered the name, he offers.
7.5	"He offers for himself, he offers for the son of so-and-so, he offers for so-and- so's grandson, he offers for his great-grandson." Thus for four persons.
7.6	"For so-and-sos father, for so-andso's father." Thus for the sons as born.
7.7	Some say for women also.
7.8	"For those who are to be born, he says the last one, 'He offers for the father, for the grandfather, for the great-grandfather.'
7.9	As prescribed.
7.10	Here he gives the bull to the Subrahmaṇya.
7.11	No one should approach the Sadas on this night.
7.12	Here the Ṛk and Sāman become united, so says the Brāhmaṇa.
7.13	When the Vasatīvarī waters have been taken around, they call the Subrahmaṇa to recite the Sutyā-hymn in the Agnidhriya hall or in the room of the wives, and they enter.
7.14	May we not be deprived of the rite tomorrow.
8.1	Time invites him.
8.2	Having put on the sacrificial thread and sipped water, he approaches between the sacrificial post and the heap of grass.
8.3	Thou art the bow-string. Bestow on me nectar. May we be long-lived, may we be radiant, may we be victorious.
8.4	This is the same as the Prapaṇā. Standing in the Utkara while taking the Ajyagrahas, he invites the Subrahmaṇyā to the Sutyā today.
8.5	If they were to say, "Sing the Viśvarūpa," he should say, "This is the thirteenth Stotra without any action." If they were to say "Enticing Viraj,"
8.6	It should be done in the Sansa.
8.7	When the time for sprinkling comes, he enters the Havirdhāna shed through the eastern door and touches the southern Havirdhāna with the formula, "Thou art the back of Visnu."
8.8	"Thou art the belly of Visnu" (he touches) the northern one.
8.9	Having gone between the two Havirdhāna sheds, he sits behind the southern Havirdhana shed.
8.10	"He sits down, saying, 'From here I sit down in the abode of the one who is not, in the abode of him who is better than us, in the abode he who is better than we, the one who is cast out, the one who has gone away.'
8.11	He puts down grass, either that which has dried up at the tip or that which has been cut at the tip.
8.12	Having touched water, he sits down, saying 'I sit down in the house of Vasu.'
8.13	He sits down wherever he intends to do something, using this same (verse).
8.14	Then he says, "Salutations to the ancestors who have been before, salutations to those who sit together."
8.15	They yoke speech with a hundred feet, singing with a thousand turns.
8.16	The Gayatri, the Tristubh, the Jagat, all forms, the gods have gathered the places.
8.17	Then he gives the lower axle and the pot to the Adhvaryu.
8.18	He receives it with the formula, "I receive thee in the impulse of god Savitr, with the arms of Asvins, with the hands of Pūṣan."
8.19	Having received it, he places it on the right thigh, removes the strainer above the head and purifies it.
8.20	"May the Vasus purify thee with the Gayatri metre, for offspring, for prosperity."
8.21	Having purified it, he places the dice afterwards.
8.22	"You are Brhaspati's, you are Vanaspati's, you belong to Prajapati, you are the vessel of life."
8.23	Having placed the dice afterwards, he sings the Gayatri in the Visvarupa verses. This is the Brahmanical text.
9.1	The Vasus, the Rudras, and the Adityas, with the Gayatri, Trishtup, and Jagati metres, respectively, let them invoke thee.
9.2	He passes over the axle, above and above, with the filter.
9.3	One should not touch the axle.
9.4	As he sits down facing east, with the others sitting behind him, he touches the Drona-pot with the formula, "Thou art the protector of the body; protect my body. Thou art the bestower of brilliance; bestow brilliance on me. Thou art the giver of life; bestow life on me. Thou are the giver of vigour; bestow vigour on me."
9.5	Having placed the stones in front of him, he touches them with the formula, "The hawks, the unvanquished, the embryos of truth, the hundred-thousand, the destroyer, the mountains, the quarters, do bring to us that hero whom many of us live upon, the one who is cursed and the one who curses others."
9.6	In them he places the pot of Drona, saying, "I place this on the Brahmic lustre, the sacrificer in the heavenly world."
9.7	He presses it down, saying, "The goddess has placed thee on the firm seat, on the firm seat thou sittest, on the firm energy thou sittest."
9.8	He removes the filter and cleans it, saying, "May the Vasus cleanse thee with the Gayatri metre; may the Rudras cleanse thee with the Tristubh metre; may the Adityas cleanse thee with the Jagati metre."
9.9	He spreads the filter with its ten corners pointing towards the east, saying, "The filter is spread for thee, O Brahmanaspati," with this three-versed formula.
9.10	They bring the king.
9.11	He recites over him: "Flow, O Soma, the most radiant, for the gods, for the most beloved abodes. Flow three times for the gods, three times for the Adityas, three times for Angiras. By which fourth Brahma, by which Brahma Brihaspati, flow for me by that."
9.12	"May he purify for us, for the cow, for the people, for the horse, for the king, for the plants."
9.13	They purify the continuous bright (Soma).
9.14	The Adhvaryus take up the Grahas.
9.15	When taking up the Āgrayana Graha, one makes a hissing sound.
9.16	That is the hissing sound.
9.17	Then he chants the Udgātāikaraṇa (hymn) in the Gāyatrī metre, "Thou art exalted, O Agni, for the sake of the birth."
9.18	Having taken up the Grahas, having touched water, he touches the earth with the verse, "The drop has fallen on the earth, on the heaven, on this womb and on the former one."
9.19	"I offer the drop moving along the third womb, along the seven Hotr priests."
9.20	"May I be protected with offspring and prosperity. May my strength and energy not be destroyed." He touches himself.
10.1	Having touched water, they move in a continuous line.
10.2	The Adhvaryu moves first, then the Prastotar, then the Udgatar, then the Pratihartar, then the sacrificer, then the Brahman moves last.
10.3	They offer the oblations as they move.
10.4	May I be acceptable to speech, may I be acceptable to the lord of speech, O goddess Speech.
10.5	Whatever is sweet in your speech, may that be in me. Svāhā to Sarasvatī.
10.6	He offers the second oblation: "May the god Surya protect me from the heavenly Rākṣasas, the wind from the aerial ones, Agni from the earthly ones. Svāhā."
10.7	They move towards the outer Pravargya.
10.8	The Adhvaryu recites the formula, "I am rubbing this divine horse."
10.9	He strews grass along with the water-pot towards the south of the Cātvāla.
10.10	They sit down on the strew.
11.1	The Udgātṛ has turned back from the Udgītha.
11.2	The Prastotar recites facing the east.
11.3	The Pratihartar recites facing the south.
11.4	Having recited the Stotra, he recites the Pavamana-japya.
11.5	May there be prosperity, may there be prosperity. May there be prosperity for the cattle. May there be happiness, may there be happiness. May there be food, may there be nourishment. May there be the Soma, may there be the Soma. May there be for me brilliance, may there be for me spiritual splendour, may there be food for me, may there be earth for me, may it be for me nourishment, may it be reproduction of offspring, may there be Earth for offspring, may there nourishment for offspring, may reproduction for offspring, may it be the kingdom of King Soma, may it be my village.
11.6	The directions, the sub-directions, the intermediate directions, the upper directions, the directions.
11.7	"The earth, the heaven, the heaven, Om, in the revolving (verses).
11.8	" "The directions, protect my hearing, do not injure me," he touches the approaching (priests).
11.9	Then he gives the order:
11.10	"O Brahman, we shall praise, O Prashāstṛ (i.e. the Udgātṛ)."
11.11	The Prastôtṛ says to the Brahman: "The Prasuta is recited, he places the Upaḍhā."
11.12	They praise with the Bahispavamāna hymn, which is performed once.
11.13	The Ahinkrita (hymn) is the seed of the others, the Gayatra hymns.
11.14	He makes the sacrificer recite (the formula) at the Stuti-recitation: "Thou art the hawk, the Gayatri metre, I follow thee. Do thou lead me to welfare. Let me not go to the praised from the praised. We desire Indra, we desire the sun, we desire the moon. We desire the heaven, we desire the earth. We desire the waters, we desire the plants. We desire the cattle, we desire the men. We desire the food, we desire the drink. We desire the wealth, we desire the prosperity. We desire the offspring, we desire the progeny. We desire the fame, we desire the glory. We desire the praise, we desire the praise."
11.15	"Thou art the bull, the Tristubh metre." At the Madhyamdina Pavamana.
11.16	You are the voice, you are the song, in the Jagati metre, in the Arbhava.
11.17	The praised one is praised, with strength, with milk, in the Avartisa.
11.18	Then, praising, he says the middle one to the Adhvaryu in the Pavamana verses, and the highest one to the Hotri in the Avarti.
11.19	Then he places the water-pot in the Catvāla-hole, saying, "I send you to the ocean, to your own unlimited abode. May our heroes go there without injury. May they not be separated from their own."
11.20	If another one were to rise, he should rise when he is rising and should follow him.
11.21	Having risen, he makes the sacrificer step over the northern end of the altar, saying, "Do not fall from heaven."
11.22	The right foot within the altar, the left foot outside the altar.
12.1	When the Savaniya animal has been offered with the oblation, then the Udgātṛs cleanse themselves at the Cātvāla, saying, "The waters are firm, the waters are bountiful; may they bestow on us strength, great strength, and sight.
12.2	The most pleasant juice of yours, do ye now bestow on us, like mothers to their children. To that do we come to you, for whose sake ye are gratified, and do ye beget us.
12.3	Carry this water away, O ye Waters, and the sin and the stain.
12.4	Whatever injury, whatever falsehood, whatever curse I have uttered, may all the Waters release me from that sin."
13.1	The Veda is the altar. One approaches the altar by approaching the Veda.
13.2	O altar, you are the altar of the gods, made of clay. May there be peace for you.
13.3	May you not harm me. He stands facing the sun, saying, "O lord of paths, may there be peace for me on this path leading to the gods. May there be safety with the fierce army. May Agni protect me."
13.4	He attends upon the Dhishnyas (with the formula), "Thou art the lord, the protector of the Krsanvas, protect with the Raudra array. O Agni, do thou nourish me. Let there be thy reverence to thee. Do thou not injure me." He says this to the Ahavaniya.
13.5	"Thou art the Tutha, the generator." He says this of the Bahispavamantya.
13.6	"You are the sky, the bright." He says this about the Catvala.
13.7	"Thou are the unpressed, the consumer of oblations." He says this regarding the Shamitra.
13.8	Krishna is the best of the heaps.
13.9	Having turned around the enclosure of the Indra-goddess, having turned around the right arm, having gone around the Agnidhra hut from the north, having gone around from the west, standing facing east, he stands by the Agnidhra with the verse, "You are Vibhu, the carrier."
13.10	Standing facing east, having turned back from the Sadas, he says, "You are Agni, the bearer of oblations," on the Hotr's fire-altar.
13.11	"You are the one who knows, the one who is known," on the Maitrāvaruṇa's fire-altars.
13.12	"You know all, you are the one who is all-knowing," on the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin's fire-alters.
13.13	"You have knowledge, you are the wise one," on the Potu's fire-alter.
13.14	"You destroy, you are the destroyer," on the Neṣṭṛ's fire-altern.
13.15	"Thou art Avayu, the giver of wealth," for the Acchāvāka.
13.16	"Thou art Shunthu, the purifier," for the Mārgālīya.
13.17	"Thou hast the nectar-bearing heaven-light," for the Audumbary.
13.18	"Thou wast the Parisadi," for the Parisadi.
13.19	"Thou, O ocean, art of vast expanse," for the Brahmasadanam.
13.20-24	"Thou art the ocean, of universal extent," (thus) he stands at the Hotṛ's seat. Having gone around the north side of the hall and having turned back towards the west, he stands and recites, "Thou art the goat, of one foot," thus he stands at the Garhapatya. "Thou art the serpent, of the firm," thus he places the Prajita. "Thou are Sagara, of the firm" thus he places the other Prajita. "Thou art Kavya, the carrier of Kavya," thus he stands on the southern end of the Vedi.
13.25	Turning to the left, he stands facing all the Hotṛ-priests. "O Agni, with the fierce hosts of Sagara, protect me, O Agni, with the hosts of Sagara. May you protect me. May you nourish me."
13.26	"May you not injure me."
13.27	"He looks at the two doors of the altar. "May you open the doors of truth. May you not injure me. May the world created by the creators be created for me."
13.28	Having approached the Sadas with this verse, "I seek the adorable, the lord of the assembly, the wonderful, the beloved, the desirable, the companion of Indra, the intelligent one," having gone around the Udumbara tree on the right side, they sit down in the northern direction, covered by the Avrita. The Udgata goes out, the Prastotar faces east, the Pratihartar faces south.
14.1	They bring the cups.
14.2	When Ida is invoked, they take up the cups.
14.3	They partake of the offerings, not of the unoffered.
14.4	They partake after the Hotṛ has partaken.
14.5	They partake the Pūroḍāśas.
14.6	Having partaken of the Pūrodasas, they partake of the king.
14.7	Having partakn of the king, they partake of Pūroḍāsas.
14.8	Here they bring the Svaryam for him.
14.9	Whatever else he is going to eat.
14.10	Then the Udgātṛ looks at the goblet, saying, "I see you with the eye of Agni, the hawk, the man-gazer."
14.11	In the same way the others, in the order of precedence.
14.12	Then the Udgātṛ desires to call out, saying, "O Hotṛ, call out; O Prastôtṛ, call out, O Pratihartṛ, call out. O Subrahmaṇya, call out." The Udgātṛ alone desires to call out to the Hotṛ.
14.13	The Udgātṛ, the Prastôtṛ and Pratihartṛ and the Subrahmaṇyā.
15.1	Having offered the Upāhuta oblation, they consume the drops of Soma. They are the Soma drunk by Indra, endowed with Indra's power, of the Gayatri metre, of the morning pressing, of the Madhumadhuka kind, of the discerning kind, of the entire group, of the Upāhutad group, I consume the Upāhuted. May the tongue, pleased, be satisfied with Soma.
15.2	In the same way, in the other two pressings, the instruction is given in the Chandaḥsavan, and in the Ganavatsavan, which are the mouth of the pressings.
15.3	Having abandoned the groups of gods, and having abandoned the groups of men, and having abandoned those who are not gods,
15.4	Having eaten the senses, he touches the mind of men. I place you in my body. May my limbs swell. May the groups of gods not abandon me out of thirst.
15.5	Then he touches himself, saying, "Stand up, O seven sages! O Indra-drunk, O lord of speech, rise up, O seven priests! Accept the world, O Soma, do not forsake us. Delight us in our hearts. Thou art our father, O lord, salutations to thee. Do not injure me."
15.6	The Prastotar, having placed the cup on his right thigh, makes it swell with the verse, "May you swell, may all be well with you. O Soma, be strong, be united with the strength of the pressing." With this Gayatri verse at the morning pressing.
15.7	"May your juices be united, may your strengths be united." With this Tristubh verse at the midday pressing.
15.8	"May you grow, may you be satisfied." This is recited twice. At the third pressing.
15.9	It becomes the Jagati metre.
16.1	The Nārāśaṃsa verses are recited.

O Rathantara, may I prosper with wealth."
18.11	Then he recites the Vamadevya hymn as a blessing in front: "You are Prajapati, the Vamadevys, the refuge of the Brahman. May you protect me from that."
18.12	Then he recites the immortal Vyāhṛtis: Bhūr Bhuvah Svaḥ.
18.13	Having said this, he recites: "Who will recite this? He will recite this."
18.14	If the Stotra is in the Bṛhat scale, he should say after reciting the Bṛhat Stotra: "I resort to the father in heaven. May Bṛhaspati not harm me."

19.2	Then he turns to the Indra-verse, turning to the right. Having turned around the right arm, having gone around to the north of the Agni-bearer and the Sadas, and having gone around to behind the Sadas, he stands facing the assembled Hotṛs with this verse, "The fires are the ocean."
19.3	Then having approached the Sadas, having sat down with the same (mantra) as before, having gone out by the eastern door of the Sadas, and having approached the Havirdhana by the eastern door, he purifies the Pūtabhṛt vessel in the northern Havirdhana with the verse, "May the Vasus purify thee."
19.4	The Pūtabhrit is in the east, the Adhavanīya in the west.
19.5	The Pūtabhṛt priests offer the Pavitra in the mouth of the Hotṛ, saying, "The Pavitra is offered to you, O Brahmanaspati."

20.6	Let my mind be in my eyes, and my eyes be in my mind. Let not the Rishis of the Veda cut me off from the share of the Sâmans.
20.7	He should also look around for his shadow, for the preservation of himself.
20.8	And he should also put clarified butter in his eyes, for the nourishment of his eyes.
20.9	This also is a knowledge.
20.10	He who does not see himself, he is without fear.
20.11	From that truth, having brought more ghee, one should look at oneself only, for the attainment of the whole life.
20.12	Then he should place the Soma-cup of the Somas, with the formula, "By which (cup) they won the race, the cup of human sight, by which the hawk, the bird, the Suparna, they call the eye of Aditi endless. May Soma, the human-sighted one, place that in me."
20.13	Having looked at it, he moves around it by the right, taking the Udumbara cup, and places it on the right side of the sacrificial place.

21.4	Having filled it, they say, "May it be filled with offspring and wealth."
21.5	They bind them with the Sala-sticks. "Thou art the binding of the sin committed by the gods, thou art the binding of sin committed by the sages, thou art the biding of sin committed by fathers, thou art the bidding of sin committed by others, thou art the bidding of sin committed by oneself, thou art the biting of sin committed by all, svāhā."
21.6	And at the southern end of the sacrificial ground, the Soma-drinkers, having taken the Soma-juice, drink it together, having been invited simultaneously, with the formula, "Thou art invited." Having washed in water, he drinks the Soma-juice with the formula, “O divine Soma, I drink thee, who art praised by the wise, praised by the praiseworthy, praised by the praises, praised by the hymns, praised by the invocations, praised by the offerings, praised by the sacrifices, who art the drink of horses, the drink of cows. I drink thee, the invited, who art invited.
21.7	"May the speech, pleased, be satisfied with Soma."
21.8	He turns the right arm towards the right, saying, "One turns according to one's desire."
21.9	He turns back the left arm silently, saying, "May there be peace to the waters, may there be peace to plants. O Prāṇa, be awake in the Soma-drinking." The second time (he says),
21.10	Having eaten, he sends them to the ocean with the verse, "I send you to the ocean."
21.11	At the Agnidhra, they eat the Dadhikrama offerings in a goblet, as before, or with their hands simultaneously, with the verse, “I have performed the Dadhikramavratas.”

22.4	Going out between the Cātvāla and the heap of grass, he says, "The Prastotar recites the Sāman."
22.5	He sings the Sama three times with the sound "hiṃ". "I think Agni is the Hotṛ, the giver of wealth" - these are the third ones.
22.6	He says "Stobha" for each step.
22.7	All the wives of the sacrificer come to the end together.
22.8	At this time the gods were followed by the Rakṣas.
22.9	He saw this Sama, the destroyer of Rakṣas. With it,
22.10	he destroyed the Rakṣas.
22.11	Whatever is the final offering of all, it is for the destruction of the Rākṣasas.
22.12	They carry the sacrificial post three times.
22.13	He sings at each time it is established.
22.14	These are the three worlds.
22.15	For the prosperity of these worlds.
22.16	They perform the Avabhṛti sacrifice.
22.17	Having gone to the water after the Avabhrtha-rite has been concluded, he sips water with the formula, "Thou art the Avabhrta of eating, thou art the Avabhrtā of eating, thou are the Avabhrța of eating."
22.18	They make the kindling woods of Udumbara, wet and with leaves, with the formula, “Thou art the kindling wood, we are the kindlers."
22.19	Having gone to the Ahavaniya fire, he places the kindling woods with the verse, "Thou art kindling wood, thou art brilliance, do thou bestow brilliance on me. Svāhā."
22.20	Having placed them, he stands up reciting the verse, "I have followed the waters, I have united with the juice, I have come to the Agni who is full of milk, do thou unite me with brilliance."
22.21	Then he mutters this (verse): "May it be auspicious to me, may it be auspicious to my life, may my sacrifice be more auspicious, may my sacrifice prosper, may my sacrifice not be injured."
22.22	The Soma-drinking comes to an end.
22.23	The Udgātṛs are dismissed according to their respective duties.
22.24	This is the procedure of the one-day rite.
23.1	We shall now instruct about the time for singing the Sāmans in the Agni-installation.

23.4	"Agni is the man" while being churned, "The heap is the enemy" while being piled up.

With the vessel full of water, those that are purified, do ye cover." With this he covers.
1.11.12	If it is made of clay, he should pierce it with grass or wood.

1.14.9-11	He restrains his speech while reciting. He releases it while offering oblations. "Who is your friend? May he be your friend. I, O goddesses, am your friend. May they unite the sacrifice for us." "The goddesses who are drunk, with ghee as their back, are flowing down. They are flowing down for the one who offers a thousandfold nourishment. The one who is restrained by the churning stick, holding them equally with his breath, is pouring them down."
1.14.12	The gods, knowing the way, have found the way. May the sacrifice be joined with the lord of the mind, with the god, with the wind. The sacrifice has been joined with the wind.

1.15.5	he should say, "O Agni, I am going to offer oblations."
1.15.6	When he is going, he should say, "I am following the expanse of heaven."
1.15.7	To the west of the Āhavanīya or the Garhapatya, a yoke with a rope and a cart with a load of rice or barley, either in front or behind,
1.15.8	"You are the yoke," having grasped the right yoke of it,

1.15.24	He offers in a vessel, having placed the wooden sword to the right, and having recited all the Sakatamantra.
1.15.25	"This is for the gods," he says, touching the offerings that have been poured out. "This is for us to bear," he says, from where he pours out.
1.15.26	"For the Sphyati," he says, while touching the offerings that are poured out.

1.16.10	"With the impulse of the divine Savitr, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Pusan, I sprinkle for you Agni, for the dear one, for the one who is yonder, for the one yonder." He sprinkles three times according to the deity.

1.17.4	Or without striking.
1.17.5	"Run!" to the king. "Come!" to the Vaishya.
1.17.6	When the rice grains have appeared, he instructs, "Let there be a loud announcement!"
1.17.7	The Agnidhra takes up the stone, saying, "You are a mountain, the creator of verses."
1.17.8	"You are a cock, the one with a sweet tongue," or "You are a cock with a sweet tongue."
1.17.9	"I am seeking food, I am seeking strength," with this they strike the stone with the pestle.
1.17.10-15	Twice on the stone, once on the potsherd. Moving it three times, he puts it in nine times. Or silently, taking the potsherd with the Samya-verse. He puts the corn-husk in front or to the north, saying, "You are a year-old." He touches the cakes, saying, "They are year-old." He pours them out, saying, "I know you as a year-old.
1.17.16	"He pours out three times on the heap, saying, 'Protect from the other side.'
1.17.17	'The other side is oppressed by the enemies,' he says, and throws away the chaff from the winnowing basket.
1.17.18	Having filled the pot for the sacrificial cake with chaff, he says, 'This is the share of the Rakshas,' and puts it under the skin of a black antelope, at the intermediate point between the front and the back.

1.17.24	He scatters the rice grains into the vessel with the formula, “God is it.”
1.18.1	He instructs, “It should be made into three balls.” Here he releases speech.
1.18.2	The wife of the sacrificer carries it. If any one else's wife were to carry it, she would carry it a few times and give it to someone else. He carries it from then on.
1.18.3	The wife makes three bundles, saying, "Purify for the gods, purify for the gods, be purified for the gods." They are made well-bundled.
1.18.4	He places the kernels.

1.18.18	Thereafter he spreads the grass continuously as much as he likes.
1.18.19	He scatters the crushed grass on the black antelope skin with the formula, "The god indeed...
1.18.20	He looks with an undaunted eye.
1.18.21	He orders, "Do not scatter the grains."

1.18.23	She does all this.
1.18.24	Here she places the cakes.
1.19.1	The oblations are cooked on the Āhavanīya or Gārhapatya fire, behind the fire.
1.19.2	As prescribed, he takes up the Upavesa.
1.19.3	"He says, "Burn the Rakshas, burn the Rakshas' hand, you are the one to be worshipped," and with that he throws the two coals towards the east.

1.19.6	"He places the skull on it with the formula, "Thou art firm."
1.19.7	He places the embers on it with the verse, "Thou art burnt."
1.19.8	He places it with the formula "Thou art the supporter" to the east of it.
1.19.9	Of the eight-vesselled (cake) two are in the middle, three to the south and three to the north.
1.19.10	Of these two, he places the one with the formula, "Thou art the supporter" to the south-east and the other with the formula, "Thou art the Maruts's shardier" to the south west.
1.19.11	"He places it with the formula, "Thou art the firmest of all the directions; thou art the firmest wealth, thou art the firmst nourishment; thou art the most firm of the kinsmen of the sacrificer." He places it in the north-east direction.
1.19.12	" "He places it with "I place thee for the unbroken kinsmen of the kinsmen." He places in the north-west direction.
1.19.13	" "Thou art intelligence." He places the remaining one in the north.
1.19.14	" "As of the eight-vessel, so of the eleven-vessel, he places three.
1.19.15	Of these, the two which are the most distant from the middle one are the two which are nearest to the middle one.
1.19.16	Of these two, the one which is the most distant from it is the one which is nearest to it.
1.19.17	As stated in the case of the intervening regions.
1.19.18	The remaining ones are those which are farthest from the Cit.
1.19.19	As in the case of eleven potsherds, so in the case of twelve potsherds.
1.19.20	He places embers on the potsherds with the Vedic formula, "Be heated by the penance of Bhrigus and Angiras."
1.19.21	Having heated the vessel, he pours the grains into the windless place.
1.19.22	"He pours the grains from the black antelope skin, with the formula, "For the god thee."
1.19.23	Three times with the formula, and once silently.
1.19.24	While pouring, he restrains speech, and while sprinkling, he releases it.
1.19.25	"I pour thee with the two Vāra-cups of Hari." He pours the flour three times through the two strainer-bags, held above.
1.19.26	"The god is indeed."
1.19.27	Taking the flour in the ladle and pouring it into the Veda, he brings it to the flour with the formula, "The waters have united."
1.19.28	If the prepared ones were not available, then one should mix them with whatever Yajus verses are available. This is a statement of purpose in an emergency.
1.19.29	"He brings them saying, "You have been born from the waters."
1.19.30	He sprinkles them clockwise, saying, "Be united with the waters."
1.19.31	"I am uniting you for the sake of generation," or "I am uniting you as the generator."
1.19.32	"Thou art the head of the sacrifice," he says, making the ball.
1.19.33	"Turn ye according to your share," he says, dividing it.
1.20.1	"May Savitr, the god, divide you; may Bhaga, Savitr, divide you; Savitr, Pusan, divide you; Vayu, Savitr, may divide you; I divide you for the mother."
1.20.2	Having made the two balls equal, he touches the Agniya (ball) with the formula, "This is for Agni" and the Uttarā (ball) with "This is for the deity."
1.20.3	"I am removing the face of the army from the southern half of the skull," having removed the embers from the southern half, he removes them from the northern half.
1.20.4	Thus the rites of these (balls) are performed in sequence.
1.20.5	Each of the similar kinds of oblations is offered separately.
1.20.6	The offerings that are made together are excluded from each other, as in the case of the Vada and Dana offerings.
1.20.7	The Udvapana and Nispavana rites are performed everywhere at the beginning of the sacrifice.
1.20.8	Taking the right-hand lump of rice, saying "You are the head of the sacrifice," he places it on the right-hand skull-cup, saying "You have the heat, you are the life of the universe."
1.20.9	"May you be in the heat of the heat."
1.20.10	So also the northern one.
1.20.11	"May you spread out widely." He spreads out.
1.20.12	He spreads out all the potsherds.
1.20.13	Having brought water into the vessel, he says, "Take the skin," and anoints it with clay, moving clockwise, without scraping.
1.20.14	"May it be protected from within," he makes three rounds with the firebrand.
1.20.15	"May Vāyu, the lord of the sacrifice, protect you."
1.20.16	He kindles with darbha grass, saying, "May the god Savitar melt you."
1.20.17	He heats with burning grass, saying, "May Agni protect your body."
1.20.18	He scatters hot ashes with the Veda, saying, "Be united with the Brahman."
1.20.19	Or, "Take the Brahman."
1.20.20	He releases the speech when he says, "Do not burn, do not burn."
1.20.21	He washes his fingers and rinses the vessel over the embers.
1.20.22	Having drawn three lines towards the north with the wooden sword, either to the east of the Āhavanīya or to the east of Garhapatya, he says, "For oneness, svāhā," and moves them three times without touching each other.
1.20.23	He then leads it (the fire) and kindles it.
1.20.24	He makes the altar of the size of the sacrificer on the eastern side of the Ahavaniya fire.
1.20.25	It is of the size of a man, lying down.
1.21.1	The altar was made by the Veda. The earth spread out. The earth carries the embryo of the lord of the earth within the worlds. From that the sacrifice is born, giving everything. Thus he recites in front of the Stambayajus. He smears the altar three times with the Veda.
1.21.2-6	From the first half of the Veda, the Stambayajus is taken up to the third part. Taking up the wooden sword with the formula, "Thou art for the god." He consecrates it with the formula, "Thou art the arm of Indra." He cuts off the tip with a darbha-grass with the formula, "Thou art the thousand-armed, hundred-rayed." He places the darbha-grass, either with the tip towards the east or towards the north, with the formula, “Thou art the armour of the earth.”
1.21.7	"O Earth, the deity of sacrifice," he strikes with the wooden sword.
1.21.8	"The stone has been struck away from the earth," he takes up the earth with grass, saying, "The stone has been driven away, the killer has been driven away."
1.21.9	"Go to the cattle-pen," he carries it away.
1.21.10	"May the sky rain for you," he looks towards the altar. "May Parjanya rain for you," towards the sacrificer.
1.21.11	Having placed the two hands, stretched out, towards the north, the Agnidhra sits down.
1.21.12	"He places it (the fire) in the middle of the altar with the formula, "In the course of the Veda, the binding."
1.21.13	It becomes a heap.
1.21.14	The Agnidhra takes up the heap with the formula, "The Avabādha, the Durasya."
1.21.15	Having taken it around, he places it.
1.21.16	Thus he takes the second. Thus he takes the third.
1.21.17	"He strikes the second time, saying, "May the auspicious plants not injure your root."
1.21.18	"He takes the second time, (saying), "The Araru is driven away from the divine sacrifice."
1.21.19	"He seizes the second time, "The divine sacrifice is driven away from those who are to be driven away."
1.21.20	"He strikes a third time, saying, "May the drops not fall from heaven."
1.21.21	He takes the third (brick) with the verse, "The stone has been removed from the earth, it is not for the worship of the gods."
1.21.22	He takes the third (verse) with the verse "The stone has fallen, it is for the destruction of evil."
1.21.23	He takes silently the fourth (verse).
1.21.24	He takes the entire darbha grass.
1.21.25	He takes the fourth (verse) with "May the stone not fall on the heaven."
1.21.26	He encloses the altar with the wooden sword.
1.21.27-30	The Vasus hold thee, thus he writes the line towards the south, towards the east. The Rudras hold thee, thus towards the west, towards the north. The Adityas hold thee, thus to the north, towards the east.
1.22.1	Having come to this, men make this altar rich in wealth, rich in Rudras, rich in Ādityas, as the expanse of heaven and earth, so that this sacrificer may not be injured. This is the place of Aditi, agreeable to the gods. All the gods have enjoyed this. May the prosperity of wealth enter the sacrificer." Thus he instructs.
1.22.2	Having taken out the skin of the earth with the spade, he throws it on the heap, saying, "The earth has been removed from the place of sacrifice to the gods."
1.22.3	He digs, saying, "In the impulse of the god Savitr," or, "In the work of the god Savity, the men are doing." "May the auspicious plants not injure your roots."
1.22.4-7	The size of the trench is to be two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one, thirty-two, thirty-three, thirty-four, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine, forty, forty-one, forty-two, forty-three, forty-four, forty-five, forty-six, forty-seven, forty-eight, forty-nine, fifty, fifty-one, fifty-two, fifty-three, fifty-four, fifty-five, fifty-six, fifty-seven, fifty-eight, fifty-nine, sixty, sixty-one, sixty-two, sixty-three, sixty-four, sixty-five, sixty-six, sixty-seven, sixty-eight, sixty-nine, seventy, seventy-one, seventy-two, seventy-three, seventy-four, seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight, seventy-nine, eighty, eighty-one, eighty-two, eighty-three, eighty-four, eighty-five, eighty-six, eighty-seven, eighty-eight, eighty-nine, ninety, ninety-one, ninety-two, ninety-three, ninety-four, ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven

1.22.9	For one desiring cattle, he carries the excrement and grass.
1.22.10	Having done that before digging, he digs the excrement and carries it with a mantra.
1.22.11	Here, on the full moon day, he makes the altar.
1.22.12	On the day before the new moon.
1.22.13	Before bringing the sacrificial grass.
1.22.14	Whatever is to be done before the northern enclosure, he does it on the previous day along with the northern enclosure.
1.22.15	Having invited with "O Brahman, I shall take up the northern enclosure", he takes it up.
1.22.16	Some recite the northern enclosure with mantras and the southern one with yajus.
1.22.17	"You are truth," on the right side; "You are the abode of truth," on the west; "You are truth's glory," on the north.
1.22.18	"You are the support," "You are the nourishment," he smears the west with the wooden sword.
1.22.19	Having recited the mantra, "Before the cruel one..."

1.22.22	He should meditate on the person whom he hates.
1.22.23	Having placed the wooden sword in the heap of wood, he says, "You are the hundred-splintered, you are the wooden, you are the killer of the hater."
1.22.24	He places the sacrificial grass in front of the Prāñchu-sthavira.
1.22.25	Having not shaken the hands, he places the vessels on the ground, not touching the Vedi, because of the covering.
1.22.26	Having shaken the hands, having washed the wooden sword, he touches the tip.
1.22.27	He places the kindling wood and sacrificial grass to the north of the Prāṇita, the kindling wood to the south and the sacrificial grass to the northern side.

1.23.12	He burns them as before.
1.23.13	Do not destroy food, offspring, and prosperity. I rub you, O horse, for conquering enemies. He rubs the grass-holder all around with the roots of the grass.
1.23.14	The art of heaven is spread out, resting on the corners of the earth. With that which has a thousand shoots we destroy the enemy. Svāhā. Having sprinkled the directions, he places them in the fire, in whichever direction he cleanses.
1.23.15	"May there be joy in the hope" (he says) while binding the wife with a rope made of muñja grass or with a noose, while she is seated with raised knees or standing.

2.14.14	May your highest protection be removed.
2.14.15	The sacrifice is equal to a man, the sacrifice is equal to man. Agni, you arrange it accordingly, for you know how it is. Let the oblation offered with svāhā go to the gods.

Go to the three Paravatas, go beyond the five peoples, go beyond the three bright ones, as far as the sun is in heaven. Indra, the slayer of Vrtra, may lead thee to the highest Paravata, from which thou shalt not return. He is slain, the one who is to be slain.

3.10.3	When he is born, he first cries. Having circumambulated the horse in a clockwise direction, he steps on that very spot, facing east.

To that one, salutations to you. O Agni, the dear form of yours which is present in water, which is in heaven, which is in Vayu, which is in Vaamadevya, which is in Trishtup metre, that I obtain for you. To it, salutations to thee.

We shall proclaim the name in this sacrifice, we shall sustain it with ghee and salutations. May Brahma listen to the praise being sung, the bull has vomited this with four horns, three feet, two heads, seven hands, and bound in three ways. The great god has entered the mortals. Svāhā! The Shami-wood twigs are anointed with ghee, all of them are one in each.
3.11.3	"Agni, well-kindled, shine forth in front!" - with this verse he offers the Udumbara kindling-wood. "We worship thy highest birth, O Agni!" - with this he offers the Vaikankata kindling-wood, "The variegated (kindling-wood) of Savitr, the desirable!" - with this the Sami kindling-wood; some call the Sami kindling wood the first, and the Vaikankati the second.
3.11.4	In the morning, silently, he offers the Agnihotra without reciting any formula.
3.11.5	Having wiped the ladle and the spoon,
3.11.6	having filled the spoon with four, eight, or twelve spoonfuls of clarified butter, he offers a full oblation with the formula, "These seven."

3.16.18	If the elder has gone away, or if he is seeking to prosper, one should milk the younger.
3.16.19	Having milked into a vessel, one should bring it in a vessel.
3.16.20	If one desires cattle, one should offer with the milk of two (cows), having placed the former and bringing in the latter.

"I approach thee, O Prajapati, with breath, with nourishment, O Pusha, for me, for long life, for a hundred autumns, for a hundred years, for life, for splendour, for the auspicious, for the living." Having praised the born one, he says, "I am yours, you are mine. This is your womb, this is my womb. Being mine, do thou carry the oblations, O Agni, the son, the creator of worlds, the all-knowing." Having praised the one who is born, he gives a boon.
6.15.12	The sacrificer and his wife put on the garment of Kṣauma wool.
6.15.13	When the Agnihotra has been completed, the Adhvaryu gives (to the sacrificer) the two Vyāhṛti-verses, the two Sarpārajni-verses, and the two Gharmaśirasa-verses, with which he performs the Agnihotra. At every stage he approaches with these.
6.16.1	"May the well-kindled Gārhapatya, burning away the evil, bestow the most excellent dawns, the most excellent. May Agni, destroying the enemies, bestow prosperity, food, and strength upon us." Thus one stands by the Gārhapaty that has been set up. "May these (cows) stand by me for wealth. May I dwell here with these creatures. May Ida stand here in the middle of the Vasu, shining in all forms, O Jātavedas." Thus one recites while the (cow) being led away is in the middle of a field. At the end of the sacrifice, one gives a boon. "May I not die, may I not die. May I not die before my time." Thus one stands beside the Āhavanīya that has been set.
6.16.2	Those two of thine, O Agni, which are the peaceful forms, the Viraj and the Svaraj, may they enter into me, may they delight me. Those two of thine which are the peaceful, the Samraj and the Abhibhu, may they enter, may they delight. Those two of thee which are the peaceful and the Vibhu and the Paribhu, may they, etc. Those two of thy which are the peaceful the Prabhu and the Prabhutis, may they,etc. Those two of yours which are the peaceful are the forms, with them I place thee. He stands by the Ahavaniya with the peaceful forms. The two of thine which were the peaceful forms, O Agni, the Smik and the Smikiti, the Smikiti and the Sadamani, the Amani and the Anahuti, the Nirriti, those two of thine which, O Agni, are the terrible forms, the mortal and the immortal, may they go to him who hates us and whom we hate. He stands by means of the terrible forms before the full oblation. At the full oblation he gives a boon. Above the full oblation, having stood by means of the peaceful forms.
6.16.3	Then he worships the father with the order of Viraj: "The food that is equal to my life, protected by you, we enjoy. May we live a hundred years with heroes." This is the Dakshina Agni.
6.16.4	"Protect my offspring, the root of the world, the continuity, created from the heart of myself. I am giving it to you." This is the Garhapatya.
6.16.5	"Protect my cattle, O Shanshya, the wealth of various forms, the prosperity of the houses, and the joy. I give them to you." Thus he says to the Ahavanīya.
6.16.6	"Protect the assembly, O Indra, which increases prosperity. I give you the shade of the assembly of all people." Thus, "Protect the assembly for me, O Indra, and those who are in the assembly. Make them have control over the senses, and may all of them live long." Thus, "Assembly"
6.16.7	"Protect my mantra, O Agni, and my prosperity along with fame." "I give to Agni Budhniya the mantra, and to prosperity and fame." This is the Avasathya.
6.16.8	The Viraj Agni, created by Prajapati, spread in five directions. Rohini ascended upwards, the womb of Agni, the foundation. This is for all.
6.16.9	Where he is.

6.18.1	We shall explain the Agnihotra sacrifice, the one who offers it himself bringing the kindling wood.
6.18.2	Bringing the kindling wood, with a mind free from sickness, he approaches the fire, saying, "O Agni, may I not offend against your dwelling." He approaches the fire.

6.18.5	From the time of the Uddhāraṇa onwards, he should not eat. Having touched water with the formula, "Thou art lightning," he should go around the Ahavanīya from the left, and sit down to the south. The wife sits down to the south of the husband. "The world of the wife is Iḍā. I am the upholder of the vow. We shall both observe the vow." "The sun is the upholder of vow. We shall observe the vow." "The beautiful one is the upholder.

When it is said, 'I shall raise, I am raising,' she says, 'The oblation is of the gods. May I have safety from death. May I have well-being. May I have freedom from fear. May I have fearlessness.' Having uttered this in a low voice, she says loudly, 'I am raising.' When she is raised, she stands still, not moving, and restrains her speech till the offering. When the oblation is raised, she sits down.
6.18.7	Having risen from the northern oblation, like a horse leaping across.
6.18.8	He stands by the Āhavanīya fire with all the offerings.
6.18.9	They approach the sacrifice, with six verses. Among them, one should stand by the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice on the former half of the month, and by the Indra-Agni sacrifice on the latter half.
6.18.10	"O Agni and Soma, do you protect this (sacrifice) well for us" - this is the Agni-Soma-rite. "O Agni and Indra, do you protect us well" - this is Indra-Agni-rite. "For you both, O Agni and Indra" - this is for both of them.

6.19.8	May the greatness of the three, the Dyukṣa of Mitra, the Aryaman, the hard to assail of Varuna, be ours. For none of them is there a foe in the battles, in the contests. They, the sons of Aditi, may they grant us constant protection. May the giver of good things give to the worshipper. He worships with the Mahitrī verse, "The Savitrī verse, 'The most desirable of Savitar,' and the verse, 'The Soma-swelling, the Soma-swelling.' O Brahmanaspati, the one with the flowing locks, the one of noble birth, the one who is strong, the one who brings no harm, the one who bestows wealth, the one who increases prosperity, may he, the one who gives, bless us. May the Brahmanaspati protect us. May the one who is not to be praised, the one who has the weapon, the one who destroys the mortal, protect us. O Brahmanaspati!' He worships with Brahmanaspati verses. 'Never do you become angry, never do you let go.' Two verses, 'We have come around you, O Agni, to your house.' 'Your chariot, O Agni, may it protect us from all sides, by which you protect the worshipper.' Having turned around, he worships at the end.
6.19.9	Some call her the best of the beaten. Thou art the conqueror, I am the conqueror of him who hates us and whom we hate. He should take hold of her with the right foot if he were to compete with one better than himself. Thou art the lord, I am the lord of him who hates and whom we hate, he should take hold of the foot with the right foot. If he were to compete against one equal to himself, thou art the overlord, I am the overlord of him who hates... He should take hold with the left foot if he were competing with one inferior to himself.
6.20.1	"May Pūṣan, the protector of cattle, protect me; may Pūṣan the protector of the path protect me; may he, the protector of the house, protect me; and may Pūṣaṇ, the lord of the house, be my protector." Having recited this,

May the good Uruga protect me. May we go together with the speech that is united. May the divine thread not be cut. May the human thread not be cut, may the divine thread not cut me. May I be protected by the thread of light. May it be for me. May I not be cut off from the thread of light." Standing between the fires, he recites: "O Agni, may you bestow life. O Agni, may you purify." He approaches the Garhapatya with the Agnipavamānī verses, and also with the verse, "O Agni, the householder." He desires that blessing, saying, "May it be for me, the one without sons, the one with light." He says, "May it (be for) him, the one with sons, the one who has many sons." Having recited the names of all his sons, he says at the end, "The one with light." In the evening, he approaches (the fire), saying, "In the evening."
6.21.1	Or, this is heaven.
6.21.2	Or, "May I have good offspring with offspring, good heroes with heroes, good radiance with radiance, good nourishment with nourishment." Or, "May I know the wealth of Indra." Or, "Let my faith not fail me." Or, "I am able to support you."

He washes his hand again, saying, "Today I have uttered the speech endowed with power." Having wiped the places of the vital airs in the prescribed manner, he worships with the subsequent hymn. There he recites three times, "May you be well, may you be well, and may you be well." He takes the names of all his sons, reciting each one three times before the Agniṣomiya and Vihavya, and worships with the remaining part of the hymn after worshipping with the four subsequent hymns.

Having stood facing the Āhavaniya fire, he says, "Protect my cattle, guard them for me until my return." Having stood facing Agni, he says, "O Agni, the thousand-eyed one, protect my offspring, guard them for us until our return." Having stood in front of the Garhapatya fire, he recites, "O Agni, the householder, protect my food, guard it for us until our arrival." Having stood in the presence of the Dakṣiṇāgni fire, he recitates, "O Agni the bearer, protect my wealth, guard it for me until our return." Standing between the fires, he recites softly, "May we not go astray from the path, O Indra, the Soma-drinking one. May the evil ones not harm us. Lead us to the higher regions, O Agni, offered with ghee. Unite us with prosperity and many offspring." He proceeds, restraining speech near the fires, and releases it when far away. During the prescribed times, he observes the vow.
6.22.3	He stands facing the season.
6.22.4	If the fire is not present, and there is a need to go away,
6.22.5	he says, "Here I am, there you are. O fires, I hold you with breath, speech, and mind. Do not let my life be hidden from you. I stand facing you with the light of the all-pervading fire." He stands facing.
6.22.6	Having gone away,
6.22.7	Holding the kindling woods, they bring in the fire-wood with the verse, "May we not be deprived of thy presence, O Agni, by the evil of others." Having approached the fire-place, he restrains speech near the fires. He releases the fires and instructs, "Be united."
6.23.1	He stands up to the blazing (fire) with the verse, "Salutations to thee, O Agni, the bright, salutations to thee, the bright, O Agni, in the forest of the Upavasatha (rite). Shine forth with thy body. May I be united with wealth." With these three verses he places three kindling-sticks. The fourth verse is, "May the kindlers place thee in a hundred snows."

"Do thou protect these houses of mine, O Mitra-Varuna, the undestroyed, the uninjured, Pūṣan has protected them. May we come back to them." Standing between the fires, he mutters, "Do thou guard." At every place he adds, "Do thouguard.
6.23.2	Then, some say, “Who will awaken the superior one who is asleep?” The attendance would be only for those whose teachings have not been spread. “O Abhayankara, grant me freedom from fear. May I be well. I shall go forth.” “Going forth,” he says, “O Abhayankara, grant me freedom. May I be safe. I shall go.” Having gone forth,
6.24.1	Do not be afraid, do not be frightened, bringing strength, we come. Bringing strength, the possessor of wealth, of good understanding, I come to the houses, rejoicing in mind. To those houses which one approaches when departing, where one is happy, we invite the houses. May they know us who know. Invited are the cows here, invited are the goats. And also the gravy of food is invited in our houses. Invited are our friends, the friends of much joy, the men who are faultless, may our houses be always. May our houses be strong, rich in milk, rich in food, rich in water, not needing to be eaten, not needing to drink, may our houses not be afraid. He approaches the crocodiles for your safety. I resort to the peaceful, the auspicious, the auspicious of the auspicious. He enters, saying, "That day on which he comes, he does not quarrel." I resort to the houses with good minds. The destroyer of heroes, the most heroic, carrying food, rejoicing, in them I shall dwell with good mind. He dwells, saying, "With you all, we may cross over the streams as if they were rivers."

10.21.5	If a son is not born in a year, then one should perform the sacrifice with four Yajus verses, Tvashtra and the wives of the gods, desiring a son. If a son is still not born, then one should disregard that and perform the sacrifice with the four Hotr verses.
10.21.6	When the king is surrounded in battle, when the army is exhausted, when the sun is shining, he offers the first oblation with four spoonfuls of clarified butter, and the second with the Graha.

10.22.1	The rites connected with the sacrifices have been explained.
10.22.2	One who is practising black magic should offer oblations to the ten Hotṛ priests in a pit or a ravine, saying "Phaṭ" and "Vasat".

Or one should offer the four Hotṛs alone. The brahmin who sits to the right should be given a boon, and it is known that Varuna grants whatever fame one attains there.
10.22.3	If they were to take him away while he is still in the service of the Āgnīdhra, he should offer the Dashahotara with four spoonfuls of clarified butter and nine spoonfuls of clarified butteṟ. Some say that he should stand facing west and offer the Dashahoṭara with four spoonfuīs of clarified butter and eight spoonfuls of clarified buṟter. If they were to instruct him again, he should offer it to the Āgnīdhrā with four spoonfuls and nine spoonfuls. Some say that one should sit facing east and offer the Dashoṭara with eight spoonfuls and four spoonfuls. He thus restores his life-breath.
10.22.4	One who has committed a sin should offer the Homa of six Hotars to Rtu-mukha.
10.22.5	One who desires to become more prosperous should use the Homa of ten Hotars.

10.22.10	One who desires to be dear, or one who desires that another should be dear, having made this ornament of the Sthāgara, with ten Hotr priests on the right, five Hotr priests behind, six Hotr priests on left, seven Hotr priests above, and with the offerings and wives, having adorned the face, one should go to the other half of the face. One becomes dear.
10.22.11	Those which are heard in connection with the Homa, with Grahas and Svāhā-utterance, should be used. But those which are not in connection with Homa, without Grahas and Svāhākāra, should not be used.
10.22.12	Those which are in connection with Japas and Yājamānas, they also are connected with Kratus.
10.22.13	They are not connected with Kratus for one who has kindled the sacrificial fires.
10.23.1	Vasishtha is the Brahman in the Jyotishtoma.
10.23.2	Or whoever studies the Stomabhāgas.
10.23.3	Or the priests, one to another, follow the tradition of the sacrifice.
10.23.4	As long as the priestly duties are performed, so long is the sacrifice in the Hotṛs.
10.23.5	As long is the Yajus in the Adhvaryus.
10.23.6	As long are the Sāmans in the Udgātṛs.
10.23.7	Wherever the sacrifice is stopped, it is in Brahman alone that the sacrifice continues.
10.23.8	Therefore, in this cessation, one should be silent.
10.23.9	If one speaks carelessly, one should recite the Vedic verse dedicated to Vishnu and then again restrain speech.
10.23.10	When the king is being measured, when the fire is being measured, and when the great altar and the northern altar are being measured, when a king is being carried, when he is being consecrated, when the Bahispavamāna is being chanted,
10.23.11	when the cauldron is being filled, and when the cauldron rites are being performed,
10.23.12	when it is being removed,
10.23.13	when the fire is being built,
10.23.14	when it (the cauldron) is being drawn,
10.23.15	when it being filled,

Facing upwards with the formula, Bhūr Bhuvah Suvar. He then sprinkles it with the formula, ”I sprinkle you together.” He sprinkles it and consecrates it with the formula.
15.4.4	"I take thee with the measure of the sacrifice, with the praise of the sacrifice, and with the praise of thee." Thus he takes it.
15.4.5	"The sacrifice has gone to the people of the gods," so says one after the butter.
15.4.6	"To the lord of the earth, svāhā! To the lord of the world, svāhā!" "To the lord of beings, svāhā." Thus they recite for the spilled (oblation). It is heard in all the oblations without any distinction.
15.4.7	If the skull were to be lost, one should offer a cake on two potsherds to Asvins, a cake on one potsherd to Dyāvāpṛthivi, and a cake on three potsherds to Agni. The Hotṛ priest is from the Bhārgava clan, and the Dakṣiṇā is a one-year-old (animal).

15.4.13	The one who has set up the fire is brought to the gods. The gods do not eat the food of one who eats new grain without performing the Agrayaṇ rite. One would be eating the share of the gods that has been set aside. One would incur misfortune.

15.4.27	If there is any leftover from the sacrifice, one should establish it with that. If one hates someone, one should give that dakṣiṇā to him. One binds him with Nirṛti.
15.4.28	If it were to be exhausted in any way, it would be an atonement.
15.4.29	If it is not possible from the gifts.
15.4.30	If the oblation meant for a particular deity is spoilt, then he should offer another oblation meant for that deity.
15.4.31	In this case, the mantras beginning with the taking of the ladle should be repeated.
15.4.32	Or, if it is spoilt at the end.

15.4.39	Among them, one should be a Bhārgava. He should be the eater. A similar boon should be given to them. That is the atonement.
15.4.40	If one were to perform a sacrifice without Dakṣiṇā, that sacrifice would be deficient, and the blessings of long life would be lost. The Dakṣiṇās should be given as a means of atonement.
15.4.41	If one were to obstruct the Dakṣiṇas that have been designated, one should give the best land as a means of atoneme

He should throw it into the fire with folded hands, saying, "May the sacrificer not be harmed, may the wife not be harmed, the sacrifice not be harmed, and the lord of sacrifice not be harmed. Svāhā." He should then give him a full vessel. That is the atonement.
15.4.49	If the sacrificial cake falls down, he should win it back. Having approached it within the altar, he should say: "Why did you fall? Why did you jump? O peaceful one, come here for peace. Having become a silent one fit for the sacrifice, sit in your own abode." He should say this and sprinkle it with ghee. "Sit in your own abode. Do not harm, O god, sent by the gods. With ghee, with brilliance, with ghee, do not injure us in any way. For the sake of peace and well-being, sit on this sacrificial grass." He should recite this mantra over it or sprinkle it.

15.5.4	"You are the Soma's ghee, the oblation of oblations, the light of lights, the share of all the gods. Having recited this, let the Maruts sprinkle you together, Indra, Brihaspati, and this Agni may sprinkle you together with life and strength. May he bestow all life upon me.

16.3.25	The Udgâtri having uttered the word "jaṭam" gives it to the Prastôtṛ.
16.3.26	The Prastôtṛ gives it to the Adhvaryu.

16.3.36	If the chariot is drawn, then you should yoke the chariot of the horse-charioteer, going to the west, here is your release. Pour the oblations with honey. Then drink the Soma, O ye possessing strength, with the season. Drink the Soma, O Vausat! His performance is done with the Marutvatīyas.

16.3.38	The mothers are placed to the south of the Marjalyan-chamber.
16.3.39	At the place of the sacrificial grass, he performs the Mahendra Stotra with Darbha grass and water. The sacrificial grass is a modification.
16.3.40	When that (Soma) is taken up, the calves are released and united with their mothers. The cows are driven along the northern path and then along the southern path. They go beyond the boundary. The six-day Pañcadaśa sacrifice comes to an end.
16.4.1	When the six-day Paṅkti sacrifice is over, they drink ghee or honey.
16.4.2	There are three Upavasatha days with Stotras.
16.4.3	The tenth day is the Agniṣṭoma, with the Rathantara as the Sāman.
16.4.4	Here there is no one who is not spoken to by anyone.
16.4.5	Those who are outside the assembly should speak, if they do not find it in the inner assembly.
16.4.6	If they do not find it there, the householder should be told.
16.4.7	Having spoken to the householder, he should say that.
16.4.8	In which one is invoked, even that one should be accomplished together with the householder. Both of them bring the kindling wood on this day.

Here is delight, here is enjoyment, here may you enjoy, here may you delight, here may you be delighted, here may you rejoice. With the two verses, "Here is delight, here may there be enjoyment, here may there he delight, here may we enjoy, here may there delight, here may I enjoy, here may I delight, here may the delight be yours, I offer the Udumbara twig to the Garhapatya."
16.4.13	This is the thousand-fold man, the vision of poets, the light of the mind, the law of the gods, the shining ones, the dawn, the faultless, the equal, the flowing, the knowing, the wise, the angry, the knowing, and the Ati-chhandas. They approach the offering fire.
16.4.14	They approach the Prajapati, the mind-grasping, the spreading.
16.4.15	When the Soma has been poured into the vessel, he mentally contemplates the earth with the formula, "Thou art poured into this vessel." He takes the Prajapati-graha of Soma with the formula, “I take that which is dear to Prajapati Manu.” He takes the Prajapaty-graha of the mind. He should take the Soma from the sky, or from the third pressing, as much as is sufficient for one cupful.
16.4.16	Therefore one should take (the Soma) with the Upavasu cup. The Hotr's cup and the other cups are raised.

16.4.26	After offering, they take, eat, and look at each other. They become equal in the rites of Samupahūti. Sitting around the householder, they ask.
16.4.27	The Adhvaryu asks, "By whom did the Dashahotar priests perform the Sattra? By whom did they attain the status of a householder? By whom did you generate offspring?"
16.4.28	The householder replies, "They attained the status of a householders by Prajapati. By him did they generate offspring."
16.4.29	The Brahmana asks, "By whom did the four Hotras perform the Sattra? By whom did they attain the status of the householder? By whom did the plants originate?" The householder replies, "They attained the status of the householders by Soma. By that, the plants originated."
16.4.30	The Hotr asks, "By what did the five Hotras perform the Sattra? By what did they conquer the householder? By what did the Asuras from these worlds? By what did he win their cattle?" The householder replies, "By Agni did they conquer the house-holder. By that did they drive the Asuras from those worlds. By that did he win their animals."
16.4.31	The Hotṛkas ask, "By whom did the six Hotṛs perform the Sattra? By whom did they succeed in being the householders? By whom did the Rtus come into being?" The householder replies, "They succeeded by Dhatṛ and the Rtus came into being by him."
16.4.32	The seven Hotṛs sat together in a sacrifice. By what did they attain the position of the householder? By what did they obtain the heaven? By what did he fashion these worlds? The Udgātṛ asks. By thy Arjjunā, O householder, did they attain the householder's position. By that did they obtain the heavens. By that did he fashion these lokas. The householder replies.
16.4.33	They praise Prajāpati.
16.4.34	This is a bad creator who would create mosquitoes and thieves.
16.4.35	Or he recites the mantras of the Prajapati-sutra, "Prajapati created the forests, the mountains, and Agni, the maker. May that be auspicious. May that be good. May that be mine. Having united the dawn with darkness, he heated the sun, the brightest. The water and the heat, that is yours. That is Prajapati. Whatever thieves, wolves, biting insects, and flies there are, that is your poison. By that, you are immortal. Prajapati is the tenth day. Worship the wisdom of the poets, the bull of men. Holding the well-protected, well-endowed, and free from sin, he places it in the world of the gods." Thus they should recite the Prajapati sutra.
16.4.36	Then they choose a boon.
16.4.37	"They say, "May we have this!" Whatever they desire."
16.5.1	"Or, "May we be prosperous, may we be prosperous, and may we be prosperous! May we be well-born, may we be well-begotten, may we be wealthy, may we be rich, may we be nourished, may we be nourishing!" By this all their desires are fulfilled.

16.5.3	Here is Dhriti, here is Vidhriti, here is Ranti, here is Ramati. They sit down, embracing the Udumbara tree, as if touching it with their bellies. They recite the Udumbara verse. "You two, Indra and Parvata, are our leaders. He who would harm us, that one we strike with the thunderbolt. We strike him far away. Whatever is hidden, whatever is concealed, the hero, the most powerful, from all sides, strikes our enemies." Having recited this verse together, they stand with their right hands on the southern side of the northern sacrificial post, holding the ladle or the sharp-edged knife. They move forward, facing east, and recite the following five verses: "May speech come, may speech come, may the speech come, may it come together, may it come up. May speech come, may earth, may heaven, may space."

16.8.15	If they were to go to the eleven-day (sacrifice), they should offer the Agniya animal on the first day, and then the others in order, the Varuna animal being the last.

23.1.12	In that (pit) he places the ladle with its mouth downwards.
23.1.13	Its hole is covered with leather.
23.1.14	What flows out of it is called 'prasruti'.
23.1.15	At the time of preparing the vessels, he prepares three vessels for the Asvins, Sarasvati and Indra Sutradamana.
23.1.16-19	Three handfuls of barley, wheat and rice, and a handful of rice-grains, in a hawk's feather or in a pot. The Adhvaryu's strainer is made of goat's hair. The Pratiprasthātṛ's strainer is of cow's and horse's hair. The Adhvaryu pours clarified butter into the pot and pours plenty of milk.

23.1.24	Having taken up the sacrificial grass and clarified butter, the Adhvaryu takes up the Paya-grahas.
23.1.25	"The Kuvidanga is the same for all. The Puroruk is the same for everyone, the Puronuvakya is the same, the Prāṣa is the same, and the Yañyopayāmagaṛhīta is the same. Taking it with the formula, "I take thee dear to the Asvins," sprinkling it with barley flour, rubbing it with the strainer, and placing it with the formula "This is thy place, for brilliance," taking it with the formula "Thou art taken with a support, I take thee dear to Sarasvati," sprinkling it with wheat flour, rubbing it, and placing it, with the formula "this is thy place, this is thy place, thy place, for strength," standing with the remaining formulas according to the prescribed order.
23.1.26	When the Soma is being brought in, the Pratiprasthātṛ takes up the Soma-grahas. The Pratiprasthātr says, "The place of the gods has been made different for all of you." One Puroruk, one Puronuvākya, one Pariṣa, one Yajya, one Upāṁśu-graha. "Thou art taken with Upāṁśus, O Agni, for Agni." Having taken it, he cleanses it with the strainer and places it, saying, "This is thy birthplace for joy." "Thou art taken as Upāṁśa, O Indra, for Indra." Having taken it with the strainer, he cleanses and places it, "This is thine abode for joy." "This is thine own abode for joy." The Soma-grahas are taken up. "Thou art the Soma-graha, taken with Upāmaṅśus, O Indra, the Soma-grah, taken with Upāmśus, O Varuṇa, the Soma-grāha, taken with the Upāmśus."
23.1.27	The Adhvaryu and the sacrificer stand up with the remaining portion of the Anuvaka.
23.1.28	He offers the animals as before.
23.1.29	Upto the placing of fire around, it is similar to the one at the beginning.
23.1.30	At the placing of fire round in the middle, he places the portion of the torch in the chaff and then puts it together.
23.1.31	Having encircled it with the fire of the Sesa-fire, he places it for the purpose of burning the animal.
23.1.32	Having offered the oblations, he gives away forty cows as Dakṣiṇā, and a cow with a calf.
23.1.33	Here they should take up the Grahas.
23.1.34	The instructions have been stated.
23.1.35	All should be offered in the Āhavanīya fire, says Āśmarathya. The Soma-cups should be offered in a fire to the south, says Ālekhaṇa.
23.1.36	He offers the Soma-cups with the verse, "The one having Soma." He offers the Soma-grahas with the verse, “The juice that is collected for you.”
23.1.37	Having offered silently after the Anuvṣat-recitation, the Adhvaryu consumes the Āśvina cup with the verse, "The one whom the Asvins gave to Nāmuchi."
23.1.38	What is here poured out, to Sarasvati, the Pratiprasthâtri and Agnidhra.
23.1.39	This oblation, to Indra, the Brahman and the sacrificer.
23.1.40	The procedure of the Sura has been explained.
23.1.41	He gives the remaining milk to the east of the Ahavaniya to the Pitrs, the grandfathers and the great-grandfathers, with the formula, "To the Pitrs, to the Svâdhas, salutations to Svâdha."
23.1.42	The fathers, the Soma-drinkers, may they purify me. Thus he stands up.
23.1.43	Then the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthātṛ offer oblations with the verses, "Those who are equal" and "Those who are of the same clan."
23.1.44	At the time of the Manotā (oblation), he places the meat-soup of the animals separately in vessels.
23.1.45	Before the Svishtakrit, he offers oblations with the horns and tails.
23.1.46	There are eight each for each animal.
23.1.47	Having filled the Kuṣṭhika and the Śapha with the broth of the Aśvina, one should offer the Kuṣṭhikā and the Śapha twice with each verse of the Astṛca, placing them in the upper horn. Having offered and not offered, one should pour the libations into one's own consecration vessels. Having pierced the Kuṣṭikā and the Śpha in the Havaniye, one should offer in the same way with the northern Astṛca and the entire Anuvāka of Sarasvatī and Indra.
23.1.48	The sacrificial grass is of Udumbara grass, a span in length, with the tips turned upwards, reaching to the navel, and bound with Muñja grass. He places it in the place for the sacrificer, reciting, "Thou art Mitra, thou art Varuna."
23.1.49	The placing, sitting down, and reciting of mantras are as in the case of the Rajasuya.
23.1.50	Sitting facing east, he sprinkles him facing west with the Aśvin-Sampaata mantras, saying, "In the impulse of the divine Savitar, with the arms of the Ashvins, with the hands of Pusan, with the healing of the Ashvins I sprinkle you for brilliance and brahminical splendour."
23.1.51	In the same way, with the northern mantra, for Sarasvata, with the supreme one for Indra.
23.1.52	"Who are you? What are you?" The Adhvaryu touches the hands, recites the Vyahrtis, and calls out the auspicious names here as in the Rajasuya. Having touched the limbs according to their respective parts, saying "My head is prosperity," he descends from the chariot by the shanks and feet, reciting "I stand in the Kshatra, in the kingdom." Having offered oblations with the verses "The three gods," he touches the limbs according to the respective parts, saying, "My hair is effort."
23.1.53	The rest is similar to the Svishtakrit.
23.1.54	"As for the offering of five oblations at the Avabhrtha, Ashmarathya says that they should be offered in the Ahavaniya."
23.1.55	Having recited the formula, "O Avabhrtha, O Nichaṅkuna," the sacrificer recites the formula, "The friendly waters flow forth like drops from a Drupada. Having bathed, he stands facing the sun reciting the formula, "We have gone beyond darkness." Having reached the water's edge, he recites the formula "The noose of Varuna is released."
23.1.56	The offering of the sacrificial grass is like that of the animals. The standing is also like that.
23.1.57	Having offered the oblation with the formula, "May it be united with the earth," the Pitryajna is performed as before.
23.1.58	One should offer a bull to Indra, the bestower of strength, with the Dakshina of a bull.
23.1.59	The oblation to Aditya is known as a cow, and the calf is given to the east, the mother to the north.
23.1.60	The Kuki (oblation) is concluded.
23.1.61	One should perform this sacrifice for attaining heaven.
23.2.1	One desiring heaven should perform the Savitrī rite.
23.2.2	It is performed at the animal sacrifice.
23.2.3	When about to perform, one prepares eighty-five hundred gold bricks, as many sand grains smeared with ghee, four self-matted bricks, and an unlimited number of Lokampṛṇā bricks.
23.2.4	He undertakes the ritual beginning with the six Hotr priests.

May they be united with you." Having taken it up and sprinkled it, having made the northern altar-line ending with sprinkling, having drawn nine circular lines inside the line, having scattered sand, having covered it with Darbha-grass, having filled the outer line with curd mixed with honey and sugar, having settled down.
23.2.7	Having offered the Agnihotra, he touches the Uttaravedi with the formula, "May Prajapati settle thee; may it be firm like Angiras with that deity." Having taken Agni into himself with the two formulas, "Agni is ours," and "May Agni be in me," he touches the self-kindled fire with the formula, "Which are thy kindling woods, O Agni." He scatters sand with the formula, "Thou art the ashes of Agni." He scatters ashes with the formula,"Thou art the sign." He scatthers dust with the formula,"
23.2.8	When he scatters them, he thinks mentally, "Whatever is dark in the moon, may that be here."
23.2.9	"May your bodies be united with what is dear to you." Having mixed the sand and gravel, he surrounds them with an unlimited number of pebbles, thinking, "May you be surrounded." He arranges the pebbles, thinking, "May they grow and be united."
23.2.10	The lines should not be too enticing.
23.2.11	In the middle of the thighs he places the pot of water with the formula, "I place thee in the ocean, O speech, for progeny, for prosperity, for me for strength."
23.2.12	In the ninth line outside, he places fifteen days of the bright fortnight with the formulas, "Recognition, recognition."
23.2.13-15	In the intervals of these days, he lays down fifteen Muhurtas, with the verse, "Citra is the banner." Then in the interval, he lays down the fifteen nights of the bright fortnight, with the verse "Darsha is seen." In the intervals of these nights, he lays down five Muhurtas, with the verse, "The giver, the bestower."

23.2.25	Then in the middle, he places the six sacrificial rites and the three names of four (sacrifices), namely, Agniṣṭoma, Ukthya, Agni, and Ṛtu.
23.2.26	Then in the navel, he places the four names of the year, namely, Prajapati, Samvatsara, Mahān, and Ka.
23.2.27	He places the four bricks of his own accord in the directions, saying, "Earth, Agni and Earth and me."
23.2.28	He places the Lokamprana bricks saying, "May I fill the world."
23.2.29	Having brought the soil from the sacrificial pit, he arranges it on the altar with the verse addressed to Vaisvānara, "The earth is the back."
23.2.30	That becomes the altar.
23.2.31	He recites the ascending verse, he recites the descending verse.
23.2.32	He worships with the Upasthāna (rite), "You worship yourself, you know yourself, you are what you are."
23.2.33	He makes it a thousandfold.
23.2.34	Having made the cow, the sacrificer worships with the rites of Samhāra and Viharā, "You are the year, you are the year."
23.2.35	On the northernmost brick, he offers cow's milk with an Arka leaf.
23.2.36	You are Agni, O Rudra. This is the form of the Satarudriya. The Arkaparna is placed on the anthill.
23.2.37	Sitting behind the fire facing east, the Hotṛ recites the Anusamsas with the Anuvāka beginning with "Bhūr Bhuvaḥ Svar".
23.2.38	The rites beginning with Agniprāṇayana and ending with Pāśuka are common to all except the Ati-Muktī.
23.2.39	Having offered the Ati-mukti oblations, he offers four times with the verse, "O Agni, you are Rudra." This is the form of the Shatarudriya.
23.2.40	The second four-fold portion is taken with the formula, "O Agni-Vishnu, I offer thee the stream of Soma." The second four-hold portion is taken with "O Lord of food, I offer thee food." The second fourfold portion is taken up with the formula, “O Agni, thy seven kindling woods, thy seven tongues, thy seven flames, thy seven oblations, thy seven offerings, thy seven flames are thy seven oblations. The second fourfold potion is taken with the verse, "I offer thee with the Vasus, with the Adhritrs, with the Rudras, with the Urnas, with the Adityas, with the splendour, with the Kratu of the All-gods, with the Maruts, with the Emna. Svāhā."
23.2.41	With the sprinkling of those (oils), the sacrificer is anointed. The queen is anointed with the Anuvāka beginning with 'Virājinī'.
23.2.42	Then he offers twenty-one oblations, with the Anuvaka beginning with 'Asave svāhā, Vasave svāhā'.
23.2.43	From the collection of sacrificial grass onwards, he performs the animal sacrifice. It is common up to the offering of the oblation in the pot.
23.2.44	When the omentum has been offered, he gives as Dakṣiṇā a cow with a calf.
23.2.45	If he is unable to give so much Dakṣiṇās, he should give as much milk as that, or should cook rice for Brahmins.
23.2.46	By that alone his desire is fulfilled.
23.2.47	The Upavasatha rite is performed in the same manner as before. The Graha of Uşņimanta is taken in the Udumbara vessel with the verse, "Thou art taken by the wise, by the purifier, by the wise, for the wise, for Uşnimanta, the wise, the purifier." Some say that the Graha of Uṣṇimanta is taken with the verse, “O Death, I am thy servant, O Death, I am thine.”

The formula for eating is "Thou art the eating, thou art the eating of immortality." Having eaten, he establishes the vital airs in himself with the formula, "Thou art the Mandra-abhibhuti." From here onwards the ritual pertaining to the Paśu is concluded with the Savitrī verse.
23.3.1	By this (verse) the Naiciketas is explained. There are no lines here. Twenty-one golden bricks or sugar-bricks, anointed, are placed at the time of piling up, on the navel itself. "The world is square, the world is round." With the verse "You are the world, you are heaven," each time according to the mantra.
23.3.2	Now, some people perform the animal sacrifice on the northern altar. The Brahmanas have explained them. The modifications are optional.
23.3.3	We shall discuss them in order.

23.3.5	One who desires to establish himself in a sacrifice, to obtain progeny, cattle, heaven, and prosperity, should perform the sacrifice according to the available space and as prescribed.
23.3.6	In all cases, the beginning is in the east, the circumambulation is clockwise, and the conclusion is in the north.
23.3.7	One who desires cattle should perform the sacrifice in the form of a five-fold altar, with five in each direction and one in the center.
23.3.8	One who desires to be the eldest, or fame, or progeny, should make the altar with three rows in front, three rows on the right, seven rows behind, three rows on left, and one row in the middle.

23.3.11	If he desires, "May I be brilliant, glorious, and lustrous," he should offer to the east of the Hotr's seat, to the east of those who are to the south. The one that is to the east is glorious. May it cover me with brilliance, glory, and lustre.
23.3.12	Now if he wishes, 'May they have more faith in me, may they give more Dakṣiṇā', then when the Dakṣiṇās are being given, he should say, 'Come east, come east.'
23.3.13	Having offered with the ladle with the formula, 'May the eastern one accept the ghee, svāhā', one should offer in the Āhavanīya.
23.3.14	From 'self-spread' onwards, the subsequent procedure is similar.
23.3.15	The Nāciketa rite is concluded.
23.3.16	By this the Catuhotr is explained.
23.3.17	As far as the word 'gold' is concerned, the bricks are anointed with honey.

23.3.24	At the time of spreading (the grass), he spreads the Uttaravedi with three recitations, beginning with "What is immortal and what is mortal in front of the navel."
23.3.25	There are three layers of bricks, with three recitations.
23.3.26	The Hotṛ praises with the Samcitokthya, "The great one is in front of the Rk-s."
23.3.27	The same as in the case of Svayamātrīṇā etc. The same as in Svayamātrīnā etc. In the Śatarātra, in the Sārasvata sacrifices lasting for a night, in the Śatarātras, in the three Mahāvrata sacrifices, in the three Sārasvata sacrificial sessions, in the Kāṭhaka Catu-māsyas, in the six-day-less sacrifices of the Sadhyas, in the Visvasṛj Ayana, except in the case of Prajāpati, because of the absence of Anuśaṃsana.

23.3.30	The Savitr, the Naciket, the Catuhotr, the Vaishvajit, the Arunaketa, these are the seven fires which are kindled in the Soma sacrifice.
23.3.31	The Savitr is the first fire, the Lokamprana is the second, the Naciket is the third, the Lokampraṇa is the fourth, the Catuhotra is the fifth, the Vaishvjit is the sixth, and the Arunaketa is the seventh.
23.3.32	He takes up the Savaniya-graha for Mṛtyu.
23.3.33	When one is performing the Agnihotra rites separately or collectively, he gives the Dakṣiṇās in both cases. The Dakṣiṇā for the Kratu and the Dakṣiṇa for Agni are as prescribed. The Dakṣinās for the Kratu are for all. The Dakṣina for Agni are for four. What is not mentioned in the Mantras and Brāhmaṇas is well-known here. They are not combined separately without being used.

23.3.35	The Āruṇaketu is explained in the Brāhmaṇa.
23.3.36	One desiring heaven should offer the Divasya sacrifices with the Śyenī verses and the Apadyā verses every day. Those are explained in the Brāhmana.

23.4.9	One desiring cattle should offer the sacrifice with the Pṛthivāsvā. Whatever is the Rājasūya sacrifice with the Uttara Veda, all that becomes.
23.4.10	He sprinkles with the Nārāśaṃsa verses in front of Maitrāvaruṇa and Brāhmaṇācārya, reciting, "Those fifty of mine."

23.4.18	"For Indra, thee, the shining one, I offer the shining one." Having offered the oblation of flour and ghee, having recited the formula, "Thou art shining," he gives it to the sacrificer, saying, "I give this to you."
23.4.19	Having received it, he eats it, saying, "May my face be shining."
23.4.20	Thus the other (officiating priests) also, in accordance with their respective functions, should be honoured, invited, given gifts and fed.
23.4.21	Having fed all the officiating priests, the sacrificer gives gold to the Brahman, a bow-string to the Rajanya, eight (coins) to the Vaishya, a handful of beans to the Shudra.
23.4.22	When the gold is being tied, he mutters, "You are life, you are all-life."

23.4.34	The Odanasava comes to an end.
23.4.35	The Pañcaśāradīya has been explained.

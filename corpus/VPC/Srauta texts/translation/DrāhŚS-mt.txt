1.1.16	For it is said, "This is the triple-bright (rite)."
1.1.17	In its absence, a large tree, a well, or a highway.
1.1.18	And not far from it there should be higher ground.
1.1.19	And in front of it, only a place for the gods.

1.2.10	All end with svāhā.
1.2.11-16	"Thou art the juice of plants; do thou place the juice in me." One should drink the Madhumāntha (honey-gruel) thus. So says Gautama. "Of plants" is the Vedic text. Similarly in the case of Dadhimāntha and Udamāntha. "Of milk" is the Vedic form. "Of juice" is the Vedic usage. "Of Kalinda" is the Vedic use. One should give the remaining to a brahmin.

1.2.28	Six times when the sun is west.
1.2.29	The wife's house is to be left open, and the branches are to be covered with the roof. They should not be removed, so that the fire and Soma may not be separated.

1.3.2	When the Atithya has been placed, standing beyond the right door-post, in the place within the altar, when the sacrificer and his wife have begun to recite, having uttered "O Subrahmanya" three times, he should speak the Nigada.
1.3.3	O Indra, come! O Hari, come! O Medhatithi, come! O one with the testicles of a sheep, come! O Gauramaskandin, come! O paramour of Ahalya, come! O Brahmin Kausika, come! O Gautam, come!

1.3.14	The Upasad is the calling of the sacrificer.
1.3.15	Thus at all the Upasads.
1.3.16	And those which are above the Upasads,
1.3.17	Standing on the mound,
1.3.18	And when the animal sacrifice to Agni-Soma has been offered and the Vasativarī waters have been removed, at the time of the commencement of the morning Prastara, he offers the sacrifice.

1.4.4	Here is the Gautamaya
1.4.5	O Agni, come, with the red ones, with the great light, with the smoke-banner, with the well-known, with the offspring of Angiras, with the offspring, with the offspring. Before the place of the Sutyas.
1.4.6	The fires are in the place of the gods.
1.4.7	Then Dhananjaya said: O Agni, come with the red ones. Come with the red ones! The son of Sahas of Bharadvaja, the son of Varas, the son of Angiras, the son of the offspring, the son of Vāravaskandi, the son of Ushas, the son.

1.4.14	In the case where the Ahina sacrifices are deficient, all the names are to be included.
1.4.15	The names of those who have been initiated in the order of initiation are taken at the Sattras.
1.4.16	Beyond the Atiratra, there is no taking.
1.4.17	At the end of that, the Svasutyā of Gautama.
1.4.18	Some say that it is at the end of the Armadhāna.
1.4.19	The Svasutyā is of Śāṇḍilī.
1.4.20	The Dhanañjayas do not call out.
1.4.21	The names of the best of the three are taken.
1.4.22	Gautama says that it is of the best two.
1.4.23	Thus, in the case of the Agniṣomīya animal sacrifice, the omission of the Vapa is Dhānajaya.
1.4.24	Or, the non-invitation.
1.4.25	In all sacrifices, the omission of all is Śāṇḍilī.
1.4.26	In the second fifteen-day sacrifice, one or two Agniyeys are performed after the Atiratra.

3.1.12	If not, then they should obtain the Soma by means of the country.

4.1.8	There he should place the water pot, saying, "I send you to the ocean. Go to your own abode. May we be unharmed and not be deprived of our wealth."

Let the waters carry away my sin and impurity, whatever wrong I have done, whatever untruth I have spoken, whatever I have cursed. May the waters protect me from that sin and evil. I am freed from all curses, from Varuna, from Yama's twenty-six, from all sin. May the waters and plants be friendly to us. May they be unfriendly to him who hates us and whom we hate.

4.3.8	Then again, in the same way, with the whole (of the Veda).
4.3.9	All of you are good, all of you drink Soma, all of you partake of the joy of Soma. Drink me, the supreme one.

5.2.4	Having made it, anoint it with fragrant herbs and ghee. In the three fires, wrap it in a garment with a single layer of Kuśa grass. Cover it with a garment made of silk, wool, or cotton, and place it on a bed of Udumbara wood.
5.2.5	Gautama says that on the next day, one should encircle the fire with kuśa grass having upward tips, and cover it with a cloth of the same kind, and then touch it while reciting the following verse: "O Agni, may you be victorious. May you be victorious, O Agni."
5.2.6	One should not approach the fire without permission.
5.2.7	Dhānajīya says that one should approach the fire without hesitation.

5.4.9	If the other says, "Te me iti,"
5.4.10	One should recite while ascending a mountain, "Taisha iti."
5.4.11	One should also know this, having worshipped the chariot of peace and the pillar of the branches, and having examined between the path of the wheel, "By this alone one should examine."

If they were to perform the Pravargya on the same day, they should chant in the evening and in the morning. If they were to perform it on different days, they should chant at night and in the morning.
7.1.18	If one were to praise the cows and the calves, then one should do so.
7.1.19	The metre is anuṣṭup. The cup is for Indra.
7.1.20	Or with the eastern one.
7.1.21	Doing so, Indra and Varuna, the king, ate the oblation. This is the foremost of them. I eat the oblation after them. May the Soma be satisfied with the voice. For the Soma-cup.

7.2.7	One should offer it with the verse, "O Agni, do thou protect me, the suppliant, and this path which we have come from afar. The father of the pious, the wise, the ground of the mortals, the creator of the sages, svāhā."

This is the first.
7.2.12	Thus the Dakṣiṇā is given separately to the poets of the Aurva clan.
7.2.13	Here, having said, "O Pitṛs, do enjoy yourselves, do bestow upon us as per our share," and having turned towards the north, one should stay until one feels satisfied.

Among whom I am going away, in which houses there is much happiness, we invite them. May they know us, invited by those who know. The cows are invited, the goats and sheep are invited. And the juice of food is invited in our houses."
7.3.2	Then, having sat down behind the fire, he should recite: "May the cows be born here, may the horses be born here, the men be born here. May Pūṣan, even with a thousand gifts, sit here."
7.3.3	Having removed the grass from the fire, whoever speaks to his best friend,
7.3.4	He should recite the following verses over the cows: "May the cows be released from the disease, may they be released from the affliction, may they be blessed with the semen of the bull, may they be endowed with your strength, O Indra."
7.3.5	"Obeisance to Indra and the cows, may the protector of these cows be auspicious, may the Sama Veda be auspicious, O Indra, may the Stealer not rule."
7.3.6	Those who are about to be initiated for a sacrifice should recite together, “We will do good deeds together and not bad deeds. Whatever we do in this sacrifice and whatever we did before, we will do as we are present.”
7.3.7	He who does not follow the vow should not initiate us. He who initiates us should not perform sacrifices for us.
7.3.8	The ancients, knowing that the other was angry, would observe silence for a year and then take the initiation.
7.3.9	From the time of their initiation, they would eat and sleep in the wives' quarters.

7.3.27	Or at Sattranta.
7.3.28	They should not be near the rising and setting of the sun, and should avoid the recitation outside the altar.
7.4.1	If they wish to invite the householder for any of these three,
7.4.2	then he should be invited at the Udgātṛ.
7.4.3	This indeed is the Prajāpati of the sacrificer, for he says, "The Udgātṛ is indeed Prajāpati."
7.4.4	Or in all (the rites) in the order of initiation.
7.4.5	When the Vasatīvarī waters have been taken away, they should sleep.
7.4.6	If any of them should carry the fire to a place not prescribed for it, and cremate a person who has not set up the sacred fires, and his wife, they should be made to set up the fires in the forest, carrying them away with the Apnānasamiti, and cremating him with the Nirmanthyasamhita.

7.4.12	Yash first, then Bharg, or vice versa, in the other days, in the upper and lower directions.
7.4.13	Bharg in the former half of the month, Yash in the latter half, says the other.
7.4.14-17	These two verses are spoken of the pure and impure Vīṅka. Dhananjaya says that above the equinox, there is only Vīṅka.
7.4.18	In the former case, the fourth would be omitted in the three.
7.4.19	These alone are the reversals above the equinoctial point.
7.4.20	They should be taken in the reverse order.
7.4.21	And also of the Pratiṣṭhī and Svarasāman.
7.4.22	In the case of the three, the first is omitted in the case of the four reversals near the Dasaharatra, says Dhānajāyī.

8.3.14	Some perform the Vaisvajiti sacrifice and the Brihatī verses of the Yajñāyajñiya hymn in alternation.
8.3.15	If the Brihat-saman is the third, then the morning pressing should be performed from the Sahasra (verse).
8.3.16	In the place of the Kalēya (verse), all around.
8.3.17	"This is Soma" - for the Partha (verse).
8.3.18	The Prstha verses are Abhijit.

8.3.20	"In the Go-kakub (verse), the Udbara (verse).
8.3.21	He removes the anthill."
8.3.22	From the vow of Anushtubh and others.
8.3.23	The options for the northern half of the month.
8.3.24	They perform the reverse of the Abhipava and Prishthya, repeating the days.
8.3.25	They perform in accordance with the Prishthya and Abhipava, repeating the months.
8.3.26	They alternate between the Go and Ayushi.
8.3.27	One who is preparing for the supreme sacrifice should perform the Prishthyas and Abhipavas for seven months.
8.3.28	Having made five Ayana months, one should take up the Abhijit month mixed with ten nights.
8.3.29	In that case, there is an option in the former half of the month.
8.3.30	Having taken up the Abhijit day from the sixth day, one should perform the rites on the twenty-fourth day.
8.3.31	Wishing for equal fortnights, having made five Ayana-months, one should take the Abhijit month which is mixed with ten nights.
8.3.32	The fifteen days are the two fortnights of the vow, which is unlimited.
8.3.33	The Brhat and the Visvajit are the two ends of the vow.
8.3.34	One attains the Visvajit and the Ayus together.
8.3.35	Thus, in the case of the Ayus and the Go Ayus, the Brhat is one day.
8.3.36	They repeat the ten-day vow.
8.3.37	Therefore, the vow is the highest. At the end of the vow, the Gotmas attain the Saṃvargita through the mind.
8.4.1	The options of the path of light.
8.4.2	There, what is at the beginning and at the end, above that, is the equinox.
8.4.3	In the place of the first month of the Abhiplava, the Trikardukas are thirty-six less than the lunar month.
8.4.4	Because the months are twenty-seven.
8.4.5	In the first month of Abhiplava, in the place of the sixth, Jyotiragau and Jyotiragau alone, when repeated, are nine less than the lunar day.
8.4.6	In the even months, the first of the Aiplava is placed in the place of the first. That is five days and six days less than the lunar month.
8.4.7	In the sixth month, one should add the Trikdruka and the Aiplava. That is the full moon day, which is eighteen days more than the solar solstice.
8.4.8	The omissions are in each month.
8.4.9	As the end is so the beginning of the reversed.
8.4.10-14	In the former (sacrifices) the sixth day is the Agniṣṭoma, and the last is the Ukthya. That is the Vaikāṅka-stoma. "The Bahiṣpavamāna is "Asriksate." The Gāyatrī is in the Gāyatrī, the Aśva-Māḍa in the Brhatī, and the Gostha in the Gāyatra. "Aya ruce" is the Gāyatrapārśva, and the Mārbhavaḥ.
8.4.15	When one is performing the animal sacrifice in accordance with the Savanavidhi, having performed the Uttamabhiplavapañcāha, the animal sacrifice in the sixth place is in accordance with the Sāvanavidhi.
8.4.16	Or having performed the first Abhiplavapañcãha, the animal sacrifce at the end of the month is in accordance with Savanavidhi.
8.4.17	All are deficient.
8.4.18	Or they should perform the first Abhiplavapāñcāha.
8.4.19-25	The two days of the Abhijit and the Prishthya may be combined. The two days of the Abhiplava may be combined.

9.1.13	With the Svāhā sound, the northern one.
9.1.14	Having placed the water and the Savaka offerings, one should praise with the Mahānāmī verses.
9.1.15	He who would recite the Sama-anga, would generate the Udasna-s.

9.2.4	Or, "With joy and bulls."
9.2.5	Or with both.

10.2.10	While he is placing it, he should recite the formula, "Place the stake with the Vena-sutra, do not let it fall, do not let the fire go out." It falls for the protection of Brahman, for support, for the continuity of the sacrifice.
10.2.11	One should say, "Having collected, stand."
10.2.12	They should bind the northern and southern skins on the eastern and western sides of the sacrificial post, leaving the chariot path in the south.

(He says) "May you speak to the hater." "May you speak the harsh words to the hater." Then, O Dundubbi, may you speak to us the auspicious and friendly words. May you speak the praise to us. (Dundubhi says) "May I speak to the hater the praise." "May I speak the praise to the hater." The one who is difficult to please, who is hostile, then may you speak to the prosperity, prosperity, and glory to us, O Dundubhī." Having thus addressed him with these mantras separately, he strikes him with the Bala-dhana.
10.3.5	Or he should encourage one who is killing another.
10.3.6	Having touched water, having returned in the same manner, they should stand behind and attend upon the fire. "Obeisance to thee, O Gāyatrī, what is in front of thee, what is thy head.

15.1.7	If the king has gone by another route, then he should take him along that route.
15.1.8	If the Brahman has gone by another path, then he should follow him.
15.1.9	These two are the only two ways of moving for the Brahman.

15.2.8	Having taken them, he should go forward and return, going to the right, and follow (the fire). If he has gone from the east,
15.2.9	he should go to the right and follow (the Agni) going from the west.
15.2.10	He should sit down when they have been introduced.
15.2.11	Here one should sit down when the clarified butter is to be taken up. So says Śāṇḍilya.

15.3.1	These two verses are the Stomabhāgas.
15.3.2	One should recite the Stotras in order, separately, with these. When it is said, "We shall praise the Brahman,"
15.3.3	one should say, "Praise the one who is above the first night, the one who is in the third night."
15.3.4	"The single one ends with 'Savitri-born, praised to Brihaspati.'

15.3.7	One should recite the Sandhi according to the prescribed method.
15.3.8	He should divide it into three parts. O Dhananjaya, you are Vasu, you are Vasishthi, you are Veshashri. For Vasuka, for Vasishthi, for Veshashri, I invoke Vasuka, I invoke Vasishthi, I invoke Veshashri. The one who is praised by Savitar, by Brihaspati.
15.3.9	One should recite this mantra: "Released by Savitar, the god of speech, praised by Brihaspati." At the Vajapeya sacrifice, the Brihat mantra is recited.
15.3.10-15	The other (Stomas) are in the order of their sequence. The Stotras are in the order in which they are mentioned in the text, because they are mentioned in that order. Or because they are mentioned as such in the text. Or because the Stotras are mentioned as such. Or because of the mention of the Stotras in the text. Or because of the mention in the text. The Stotras are mentioned in the order in which they are mentioned in this text. If any Stotra is omitted, it is omitted along with the Stoma-portion.
15.3.16	After the Stuti and the Bahiṣpavamāna, having offered the Vapa, having cleansed, having approached the Dhishnyas, having made the Sada-sadyas sit down,

15.3.19	One should release at the Vasat-utterance.
15.3.20	Having risen from the Avabhṛtha, one should offer the remnants of the sacrifice to the Anushas.
15.3.21	The king, who is always to be protected by the Prashāstṛ (the chief priest) in the course of the days, should speak to him. He should do both. After the removal of the Vasatīvari-water,
15.3.22	they should perform it in turn at the Sattra. If there is a deficiency, then the Brahman alone should do it.
15.4.1	Having recited the Stotra of the Prstha at the Vājapeya, the Brahman should make the Sadasya sit on the seat and go out.
15.4.2	The post of Agni-dhrīya should be dug in the east.
15.4.3	The post of Marjālīya should be in the south, inside the altar, says Śāṇḍilya.
15.4.4	There should be a wooden wheel of seventeen spokes, released from the chariot.
15.4.5	In its absence, any wheel of a chariot.
15.4.6	In that (sacrifice) one should place the arms of the god Savitar, the giver of truth, the shining, the wise, the strong, the winner of strength, the most excellent, may I ascend the highest heaven.
15.4.7	When the chariots are running in the race, one should sing the verse "The boundary is not visible." Having omitted the initial syllable of the Udgitha, one should bring it back and add two syllables.
15.4.8	When the (chariots) have gone.
15.4.9	Those who run as they have learnt,
15.4.10	or those who have fallen down,
15.4.11	or those everywhere as they have learnt.
15.4.12	One should sing while changing.
15.4.13	Or one should sing after changing, or one should change after singing.
15.4.18	Or another should change while singing.
15.4.19	One should think of the upward movement, saying, "You are the step of Vishnu, you are the traversed of Vishnu, you have been traversed by Vishnu."
15.4.14-18	He should enter the assembly, turning to the right. He should think of ascending from the north, saying, "You are the step of Vishnu, you are the stride of Vishnu, you have strode of Vishnu." He should enter the assembly turning to the right.
15.4.19	One should give honey to a brahmin and should deposit gold.
15.4.20	One should consume the sacrificial food with the Tristubh metre.
15.4.21	The elder Gautama says one should accept it.
15.4.22	"One should consume, saying, 'Who gives you? He gives you. To whom do you give? To him do you give. Who should I consume you for?'"
15.4.23	"May the goddess of speech be satisfied."
15.4.24	With both or with one.
16.1.1	In the case of a single verse, everything is to be repeated.
16.1.2	Because of the origin of the Stoma.
16.1.3	And so are the other verses in their own meters.
16.1.4	"The repetition" is like the Vahiṣṭhi.
16.1.5	Or in the three verses, because of the appearance of one verse in three verses.
16.1.6	And because of the counting of the Stoma with the Sama.
16.1.7	In the three verses, the Sama is as remembered by the teacher.
16.1.8	And because of continuity, it is called Santati.
16.1.9	And it is also said, "He sings continuously."
16.1.10	And in the single verse, it is elevated in the Kalpa.
16.1.11	In the three verses, there is a vision for the purpose of authority.
16.1.12	The Stotriya ends with the Sama.
16.1.13	In all of them, there should be Prāstāra, because of the Nyāya and Prāgātha Dharmas.
16.1.14	The teachers are not remembered in the last two.
16.1.15	And because it is shown that the chanting is continuous,
16.1.16	In his praise, the Prāstāra is in the Avartīs or in the Parya and others.
16.1.17	Dhananjaya says that it is in all the first ones.
16.1.18	Those that are in the Niṣadha are without Prāstāra.
16.1.19	In the first Prastāra, Śāṇḍilīya is recited by Dhanañjaya. In the second Prastāra, the Stotriya is recited by the Upavit. In the third Prastāra, both the Stotriya and the Upavit are recited.
16.1.20	In the Trivṛt Stoma, the procedure of Parivartini is followed.
16.1.21	In the second and third Stotriya, there is disagreement regarding the Chanda Stoma.
16.1.22	In the first Prastārya, it should be in two feet. In the second, it should be at the Kakubha.
16.1.23	In the third, it should be the Brihatī. This is the opinion of Śāṇḍilya.
16.1.24	If it is so, then the Kakubha Sāman should be chanted.
16.1.25	The Kakubha Sāmā is chanted by the elder Gautama.
16.1.26	The Bṛhatī Sāmā is by Dhānajitya.
16.2.1	The Stoma is arranged with the first praises.
16.2.2	They are the Pathyā Sāmans.
16.2.3	All the intentions are fulfilled.
16.2.4	One should perform as per the blessings.
16.2.5	Some perform the second Pathyā Sāmā in Trivṛt.
16.2.6	The first one is not included.
16.2.7	And in the case of the Sanharasirhasandhi-sutra, the sequence is not proper.
16.2.8	And in the case of this (verse), 'Avarshukastu' (is used).
16.2.9	In the case of the two verses beginning with 'Ishu', the order is reversed.
16.2.10	Among them, the former is in the Agniṣṭoma Sāman of the Śyenas.
16.2.11	In the case (of the verses) to be used in the Dasātra Satra, Śāṇḍilīya says, "One should use all (verses) for the purpose of subjugation."
16.2.12	Śāṇḍilāyana says, "The Kulayinī."
16.2.13	Both the Bhāstrā and the Kulayinī.
16.2.14	Dhananjaya says that it is the same.
16.2.16	One should prescribe the pathya (beneficial) medicines for the Hotr and the Sāman priests and the apathya (harmful) medicines for the others.
16.2.17	When they are completed, one should again prescribe them from the beginning.
16.2.18	Śāṇḍilīya says that one should prescribe the medicines for the first one who is to perform the Atharvaṇa rites, prescribing them in the order of the verses.
16.2.19	Dhananjaya says that one should complete all the medicines at once and then prescribe them with the pathya (medicines).
16.2.20	Even if the Hotr-s do not complete (the recitation of the Sāman), it is done by the prescribed method.
16.2.21	If one were to employ the Kūlāyinī (Sāman) in the incomplete (recitation), then one should employ the second Prstha of the first (Sāman).
16.2.22	One should employ the Ukthya of the sixth day with the Uttama (Sāman), and the Viṣṭutya of the thirty-third (Sāman)."
16.2.23	The application has been stated in the Brāhmaṇa of the forty-fourth (Sāman).[S0 19.40]
16.2.24	The former is the rite of the Stomas, the latter is the rite of Stotras.
16.2.25	One should do likewise in the daily rites.
16.2.26	The Anushtubh verse is elsewhere.
16.2.27	One should offer the clarified butter of the Maitrāvaruṇa at the end of the forty-eighth verse.
16.2.28	All the Hotr's verses are to be recited.

16.3.11-17	Two in the same. Three in the Ekātarīya Stotras. Four in the first, two in the other two, and two in the Brhatī. Three in any one of them. If there is no repetition, then one or two in the Gāyatrī. Both in the Brhatīs.
16.3.18	If there is one syllable to be omitted in the Sādhāsa, then it is to be omitted at the end.
16.3.19	If there are two syllables to be omitted, then it is from the beginning.
16.3.20	That is the Śaśakarna-klṛpta.
16.3.21	If there is one syllable in the Tris, it is to be dropped.
16.3.22	Or in the Tric.

16.4.4	If that is also absent, then the verse before the last one is used.
16.4.5	The verses which are not prescribed in the Ekacchas should be used in the Tricchas. The Gāyatrī, Trinidhana and Madhyandina should be used in Madhyandina. The Aindamadhyandina should be recited in the evening.
16.4.6	The verses which are not mentioned should be used in accordance with this rule.
16.4.7	The verses of Madhyandina are to be used in the Kakubya. The verses of the Vratyasloma are to be used elsewhere.

17.1.2	The first verse of the first section is recited three times.
17.1.3	The middle one is placed at the end.
17.1.4	The best is the Paricara.
17.1.5	The Paricara is the place of the three-verse section, in the middle.
17.1.6	The place of the three verse section is the Paricāra, in the best.
17.1.7	These are the Vistas.
17.1.8	In their absence, the alternatives of the alternatives should be in the places of the three-versed sections.
17.1.9	As there is one alternative,
17.1.10	there are many alternatives. So also in the three-versed Vistas.
17.1.11	And in the Udyati, the three-versed.
17.1.12	The use of the same number of syllables in the Stotras is equal.

17.1.25	Two from the two-two-fold.
17.1.26	Both according to the kind.

17.2.6	One should perform the sets of two as they are.
17.2.7	That is without fault.
17.2.8	The later section is the one that begins from the end of the previous section. The similarity is between the two.

20.3.6	The eighth stobha is repeated three times for Bhadra and Shreyas.
20.3.7	If there are five stobhas, then there are two pratiharas.
20.3.8	The division of stobhas is done with five aksharas in Dharma and Adharma.
20.3.9	Or in the form of two padas.
20.3.10	In those, the tenth stobha is the pratihara.
20.3.11	If there is one pratihara, then there are six stobhas.
20.3.12	Three stobhas at the end of the pada for Sauhavi.
20.3.13	Or at the beginning of the pada.
20.3.14	The middle speech is in the Suvarṇidhana and Sauhaviṣa.
20.3.15	Or in the Vibhāgya.
20.3.16	The middle speech itself is the Stobha of the Purāstāt Vairāja.
20.3.17	They should practice the four ends of its verses.
20.3.18	And so also of the Caturthika and Vatsapra.
20.3.19	But the Samadhi is
20.3.20	Above the Ṛg etc., Lāmakāyana.
20.3.21	Stobha is Śāṇḍilya.
20.3.22	In the case of Traikubha, the first foot is the beginning.
20.3.23	In the case of the highest foot of the undivided ones, before the application of the means, in the six or eight Vyavargas, as in the case of Vamadevya and Krosha, one should remove with the previous Vyavarga, says Sandilya, with the subsequent one, says Dhananjaya.
20.3.24	The song itself is Pratiharika, Pratihara is in the case of the Vichchhasas.
20.3.25	Even at the beginning of a foot.
20.3.26	Gautama says that one should not take up the Oṃkāra beyond the Pratihara.
20.3.27	One should take up the Svaras of the Prativedas as per the time, like the Gurddāna of barley.
20.3.28	One should not take up those of the Nakāras or the Varas.
20.3.29	Dhānajāyī says that one should take up the Omkāra of the Prativeda Svaras.
20.3.30	Śāṇḍilīya says as per the injunction.
20.3.31	Here the syllable "iha" and the syllables "ida" and "atha" are sung as the final notes, and the notes "hīṣī" and "svara" are two-syllables. The deities are in the Āraṇya Geys. Those are the final notes within the Antasāman.
20.3.32	If the Vak is the final note, then the next one is increased, or it is the Kruṣṭa note, or the Svarita note, or the Vārcika note. The first three are increased.
20.3.33	As the Devatas, the Tvashtri-s, the Yaudhajya, the Darrdhacyuta, the Atharvan, the Manthigava.
20.3.34	After that, they should recite the Arcika together with the Nigada-varti. There is no instruction.
20.3.35	All should recite the Iḍa beginning with "iha".
20.3.36	Those are the Pratichi-nedas.
20.3.37	Gautama says the Ika in other cases.
20.3.38	Dhananjaya says "Iḍa".
20.3.39	The I-ending is the means of singing in the Prastara. The Kutsas sing in the Prastaras.
20.3.40	Thus we shall have the complete and the incomplete.
20.3.41	The Udgata becomes the reply to them.
20.3.42	Some say that the complete and the partial are by the two Samanas.
20.3.43	The teachers say that the ends of the verses are to be sung with the excrement-words, or as they have been learnt.
20.4.1	In the three-night sacrifices, the concluding verses of Yaudhajayya have one syllable.
20.4.2	In the Pragathas, the verses of Brihat and Rathantara, and the Yajnayajniya, there is no instruction, and the Kakubha is above.
20.4.3	The invocation has two syllables everywhere.
20.4.4	In the three-verse verses, by combining the syllables.
20.4.5	The last syllable of the first and the first syllable of the middle.
20.4.6	Similarly, the second and last of the other two.
20.4.7	The length of the syllables of the Prāstāra, Pratihāra and Nidhana should be as desired in the Vaishampayana style.
20.4.8	That which has the form of the Rgveda is hidden, and that which has the form like the Samaveda is hidden.
20.4.9	As Pauṣkalāyana, as Uddālaka, as Viḍeha, as Samāpsuga, as Diti, as Dhānajaya, as Rgūdha, as Viḍa, as Samāpauga, as Dhiti, as Śāṇḍilīya, as Sāmoḍha.
20.4.10	In the feet with fewer syllables, Śāṇḍilya added a syllable.
20.4.11	As Agni is the lord of the three fires, as the cow is the lord of cattle, as Soma is the lord of herbs, as the sun is the lord of light, as the moon is the lord of water, as the wind is the lord of space, as the earth is the lord of minerals, as the sky is the lord of clouds, as the ocean is the lord of rivers, as the king is the lord of men, as the teacher is the lord of knowledge, as the father is the lord of sons, as the mother is the lord of daughters, as the friend is the lord of companions, as the wife is the lord of husbands, as the guest is the lord of visitors, as the servant is the lord of workers, as the lord is the lord of subjects, as the lord of the world is the lord of all, as the lord himself is the lord of lords, as the lord who is the lord of everything is the lord of himself, as the lord whose form is the lord of forms, as the lord without form is the lord without form, as the lord with form is the lord with form
20.4.12	The Anupadhi, the Dhanañjays, the Anupas, the Go, the Mango, the Uva, the Aksas, the Somadugdhas, the Uva and the Aksas, that is the place of the Sadhatus.
20.4.13	In the Paṅkti, the second pada should be divided into two, as per the number of aksaras, like the Shakra and the Shakavara.
20.4.14	The third is in the Brihatī verses, consisting of eight syllables and four syllables, as in the case of Saṅkṛti.
20.4.15	One should arrange the Simā in the Brihatīs and Anushtup verses according to the position.
20.4.16	That is the nature of the Rg verses.
20.4.17	The teachers say it is sevenfold.
20.4.18	Because there are seven Śākvara verses.
20.4.19	And they are also called Upakṣudra.
20.4.20	Of those, the second position, having made two pairs, there are four directions.
20.4.21	The third is eight and four.
20.4.22	Or four and eight.
20.4.23	In the Samadhana and Anushtup.
20.4.24	The Shakvaras are in their own places.
20.4.25	In the Yoni, where other metres are produced by practice, such as the Gaurivit, Audalaka, Utsatra, Ekakubha, and Vaikhanasa, and in those connected with them, Gautama and Sardagava do not practise.
20.4.26	Mashko Gargya is the practice. Mashko Gargya practiced.
21.1.1	In the Upastanas, there are other Nidhanas.
21.1.2	In the Ananadesa, the Svaras would be like this.
21.1.3	And in the Ananadesha, Ida.
21.1.4	U is half of Ida.
21.1.5	The natural Svaras or the first Svaras.
21.1.6	Adhyarddha is the name of Adhyarddha.
21.1.7	The natural sound is the natural sound. It shines.
21.1.8-14	and of Daivodāsa and Sujñāna. The former is on the back of heaven. The latter is on the back. Gautama and Dhananjaya say so. Opaguva and Yamatha say so. Or it may be different. Or in the case of Abhicharaṇīya, Yamatha is elsewhere. O Indra, like the sun, thou hast slain the Dasyus; O Indra, like the thunderbolt, thou hast slain thy foes.
21.1.15	He should recite it twice.
21.1.16	"He should recite, 'Like Indra, the slayer of the Dasyus, like Surya, the slayer of Dasyus, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the well-wielder of the thunderbolt, like Indra, the slayer, of the Dasyu, like Surya, slayer of the Dasa, the wielder, of the thunderbolt, well-wielder, of the thunderbolt.'
21.1.17	And once, at the most, like Indra, he has paid off his debts to the demons, like the sun, he has paid them off, the wielder of the thunderbolt, the well-wielder of the thunderbolt.
21.1.18	Just as there is a sound when a thunderbolt strikes a tree.
21.1.19	Just as a hawk would swoop down.
21.1.20	Or as a bell would sound when struck by a bell-ringer.
21.1.21	Or as the sound of a foot with anklets would be.
21.1.22	or "ganniti va" (thus).
21.1.23	Or like a pipal leaf falling into water.
21.1.24	Or "pluga iti va" (thus),
21.1.25	Or "plugi iti va" ( thus),
21.1.26	Or "sahor bhiri iti va" (Thus).
21.1.27	In the case of "kartayase" there are three options:
21.1.28	"Dayitnave ham, dayitnave ham,dayitnave ham."
21.1.29	Similarly in the northern direction.
21.1.30	The beginning is with the Gayatri verse.
21.1.31	Dhananjaya says that it is with the eight-syllabled mantra.
21.1.32	Similarly, the Purana Tandam.
21.1.33	For the purpose of illustrating it, the singing is done in the Gāyatrī verses.
21.1.34	Dhananjaya says, "We praise him with singing by men."
21.1.35	Sandilya says, "We worship him with singing by humans."
21.1.36	Some say, "We worship with singing by humans."
21.1.37	The rest is sung by the Udgātṛ.
21.1.38	With the mind, one recites the Omkar and the Svar with the voice.
21.1.39	All (the verses) are to be recited in the same manner.
21.2.1	"One recitation of the verse, "To Pavamana, to Indra..."
21.2.2	Another recitation of the verse "To the gods, to the gods..."
21.2.3	Another verse "To the cows..."
21.2.4	Dhananjaya says that the first group of verses should be recited.
21.2.5	Gautama says that two stobha verses should be recited in the middle, namely "To the gods..." and "To the gods again..."
21.2.6	The verse "To the god, to the gods again..."
21.2.7	Some say that the U-sound is to be pronounced everywhere, because it is the nature of the Stobha.
21.2.8	The teachers say that it is so because of the example of the Salinga.
21.2.9	And because the Stobha is not absolute.
21.2.10	In the case of the Jya-sici, the first foot is to be repeated and the last foot is to be added.
21.2.11	Dhananjaya says that it consists of eight syllables.
21.2.12	Having recited the two syllables of the semen, one should say "Him" and "Him".
21.2.13	Gautama says that the receiver should mentally contemplate it in the semen, not to be lost.
21.2.14	Dhananjaya Shaandilyah says, "It is indeed lost."
21.2.15	One should recite the syllables of the Rathantara color in the Abhistoma.
21.2.16	Shaandilya says, "Bha Bha Bha Bha."
21.2.17	Dhananjya says, "Bha and Bha."
21.2.18	And the three syllables are to be pronounced distinctly.
21.2.19	The first syllable is indeed omitted.
21.2.20	"Hi" is the Hiṃkāra.
21.2.21	The twelve syllables are to be distinctly pronounced in the Anushtubh metre.
21.2.22	And everywhere four, says Śāṇḍilī.
21.2.23	And one should say "as far as the end" like "the cows are wounded".
21.2.24	Having praised the Svaras and the Ajyas, and also the Nidhanavata, because of the injunctions being different.
21.2.25	Some say that the Anusvara is a foot, because of the hearing of the Stobha.
21.2.26	Or it is external Svarita, because of the similarity with Prāṇa, as it is said in the Brhat.
21.2.27	The Ācāryas remember the Ākāra.
21.2.28	The Gāyatrī is at the end, without the end, and the Aṅga is Gāyatrī. It is at the beginning and Svarita at the end. Because of the perception of diversity.
21.2.29	It is called Svarita because of being Svarita, or because of being Svaru, or because of the predominance of Svaru in the Gāyatrī.
21.2.30	And in the case of equality of devotion.
21.2.31	That is the view of Dardga.
21.2.32	Dhananjaya says, "Let it be without Svaras."
21.2.33	Gautama says, "Let there be Kshāta."
21.2.34	Some say, "Let there also be Kshānta."
21.3.1	Sandilya says, "If one desires to perform any of the optional rites, one should do so in place of the supreme two-syllabled (verse).
21.3.2	Having completed all the verses, one should say, "Let us worship the gods."
21.3.3	Dhānajaya says that all should be sung without variation.
21.3.4	They are raised as the places of those forms, because they are the finality.
21.3.5	And because of the injunction of the created characteristics, the natural tones are produced.
21.3.6	According to the principle that a single syllable is ṣṭha-svara and a double syllable is hīṣī-svara,
21.3.7	The created tone is the finality, and the variation of the letters is raised for that.
21.3.8	As in the case of the Rathantara, the Gāyatrī verses.
21.3.9	All these are found in all places, because the Gayatri is produced without beginning.
21.3.10	Some say that it is the Bahispavamana.
21.3.11	Because the modifications do not exceed the limit, just as the colors of the semen and the Rathantara are limited.
21.3.12	But the Bahispavamaṇa is not a union of their desires.
21.3.13	The modifications of the song are the limit of the Gayatri.
21.3.14	The Stotriya and Anurūpa are to be performed at the Jyotiṣṭoma alone, not elsewhere.
21.3.15	The Brāhmaṇa says, "One takes up the Retasyā three times."
21.3.16	The Gāyatrī is the northern one.
21.3.17	The Brāhmana says, "One places two syllables of the middle one and the last one of the northern one."
21.3.18	The last of the middle one, and the first of the northern one.
21.3.19	The Atharvaṇas are the ones who are blessed with the blessings of the gods.
21.3.20	The Tristubh is the northern one.
21.3.21	The Brahmana says, "Singing like a strong man, like a strong man," the Shamas, the Jatas, the Nasas, the Arvatas, the Rajas, the Asas.
21.3.22	The two upper halves of that verse are the ones that shine. This is the Brahmana.
21.3.23	Those who are above the Hinkāra, they should be removed, says Gautama.
21.3.24	"Six times" says Dhānanjayya.
21.3.25	It is in the Jagati metre.
21.3.26	And of that, four, four syllables, singing as if playing, from twelve syllables, says the Brahmana.
21.3.27	Paristoma, Antaryama, Kripa, Soma, Shukra, Gava
21.3.28	And those four syllables shine in the upper half of it, so it is Brahman.
21.3.29	Two before and two after the Dhikara, says Gautama.
21.3.30	The Stomas are bright, says Dhananjaya.
21.4.1	The Anushtubh is above.
21.4.2	The Brāhmaṇa says, “He sings as if he were reproaching them.” “The horses, crying out, have fallen down.”
21.4.3	The Brāhmaṇa states, “One should sing both the regular and irregular verses.” “One should think of the entire verse.” Gautama says, “Because the Tristubh and Jagati verses have irregular syllables.”
21.4.4	This is the same as the one mentioned by Dhānajitya and Śāṇḍilīya.
21.4.5	One should recite the second foot of this, and the third and fifth syllables.
21.4.6	The northern verse has two syllables each. The Brāhmaṇa says, "From the six syllables of the Gāyatrī verse, one should recite the two verses, 'Sanjagmāno daivā kāvāi' and 'Kāvāi' respectively." Dhānajitya says this.
21.4.7	Śāṇḍilya says this.
21.4.8	The Sad-iti is the Gayatri, the Reta-sya-ya is the Tristubh, the Dhura-ni-dhanam is the Jagati, the Samiti is the Anustubh.
21.4.9	The meaning of these has been explained. The Sama-s and the Nidhanas are desired.
21.4.10	They should not be beyond the Bahispavamana.
21.4.11	One should sing the Jagati, Gayatri, Tristubh and Anustubh separately in the first Ajya-s.
21.4.12-15	That is the ancient hymn. Dhananjaya says that the Gāyatrī and Tristubh verses are to be recited in reverse order. The Gāyatrī verse is to be recited first by the Maitrāvaruṇa priest, and the other verses are to be chanted in reverse order. This is the ancient hymn of the Hotṛ.
22.1.4	In the first case, the consecration should be done on the day of the lunar eclipse.
22.1.5	Or, seeing the conjunction of the stars.
22.1.6	Of those, one consecration is done if there is no instruction, or three, four, or unlimited.
22.1.7	Three Upasads.
22.1.8	Gautama says that the Ukthas of the Jyotishtoma are performed in the reverse order, except for the Sauvaralameya Atiratra, because of the grasping of the practice.
22.1.9	The others are not so, because of the special mention of Dhanañjaya.
22.1.10	All are optional, says Saṇḍilya, because of the equal injunction.
22.1.11	There is an option between the two, Aṣṭādaṃṣṭra and Vikalpa.
22.1.12	The Sauvaras and the Narmeḍhas, who are desirous of the Anukthy, combine it with the Atiratra, which is of the nature of the Anushtubh.
22.1.13	But there is no rule for the combination of the Anushtup with the night.
22.1.14	And it is seen elsewhere that the night is not added to the Parvan, as in the case of the Pañcaha of the Abhipava.
22.1.15	In the Atiratras, where the Stotriya is in Anushtubh, there is optionality due to the division of the Vritti.
22.1.16	Some say that it is optional because it is mentioned in the Brahmana.
22.1.17	The Jyotiṣṭoma, which is independent, has the options of the Agnistoma, Ukthya and Atiratra.
22.1.18	The Dakṣiṇās for the Atiratra are twelve hundred.
22.1.19	The Go and Ayus are also (Dakṣiṇās).
22.1.20	Dhananjaya says that the sacrificer should offer the Viśvajit and Abhijit together, in the order of east and west.
22.1.21	Śāṇḍilya says that they should be offered simultaneously.
22.1.22	The Abhijit sacrifice should be performed on the right side of the altar, and the Vishvajit on the left.
22.1.23	The wife's room should be in front of them.
22.1.24	There should be no non-priests.
22.1.25	And whatever rites are performed within the altar,
22.1.26	and whatever rites are performed outside the altar,
22.1.27	the Abhijit sacrifice should conclude the rites performed before, and the Vishvajita should conclude the rites done after.
22.1.28	The Dakshina for both of them should be separate thousand cows.
22.1.29	One may perform these two sacrifices as one wishes.
22.1.30	The fee is a thousand (cows).
22.2.1	Having risen from the Avabhṛtha, he should perform the Dharmas, having put on the skin of a calf with a reddish-brown colour.
22.2.2	They have been mentioned by the Brahmana.
22.2.3	"One should stay in the forest for three nights." One should stay in the Udumbara tree.
22.2.4	In the absence of an Udumbara tree, one should dig a branch of an Udumbari tree.
22.2.5	One who lives by digging should live by that digging.
22.2.6	In the absence of digging, one should live by digging grains stored in vessels.
22.2.7	The bamboo-stick is on both sides, says Śāṇḍilya. The Kaṇḍa is on both sides. The Dhanañjaya says, "The Kaṇḍa on both sides."
22.2.8	Among the Niṣādas, there are three kinds of living, says Parśvata. One should live near the Niṣāda village.
22.2.9	They may eat the flesh of animals killed by others, or of animals that have died of themselves, or of animals killed by lightning, or of animals found dead in the forest.
22.2.10	The people are of three kinds: the royal kinsmen, the Brahmanas, and the common people. This is the opinion of Sandilya.
22.2.11	Marriage is with the people of the same caste. The common people are those of the same caste, says Dhananjaya.
22.2.12	The people of the same village are the common people. The people of the same country are the common people, says Sandilyayana.
22.2.13	These are the rites for all the sacrificial fees.
22.2.14	Gautama says that one should bind the cow to the post on the new moon day for those who are observing vows, except for those who are one year old.
22.2.15	After performing the six-day rituals for more than a year, they should rise up.
22.2.16	If the year is not completed, they should buy a king for the night-long rituals.
22.2.17	As in the case of the first fifteen-day rite, they should be initiated.
22.2.18	In all cases, it should be as in the case of birth, except if it is obtained. This is said by Shandilya.
22.2.19	If it is not obtained, then it is also said by Dhananjaya.
22.2.20	There are three Upasads for the one-day Vrata in the Gautamaya. There are six or twelve.
22.2.21	There, one should give a horse chariot and a hundred to the Brahman.
22.2.22	So also to the Adhvaryu who kindles the fire.
22.2.23	To the Udgâtri who praises with the Prstha-s.
22.2.24	And this is also the blessing to the Hotri.
22.2.25	And to all a thousand.
22.2.26	Or to all the Vedas as Dakshina.
22.2.27	The other is the Chandilas.
22.2.28	All are thousand, and the Dakshina of a thousand is separate.
22.3.1	One who is going to perform the Sadyaskra sacrifice should offer the morning oblation at the Maharatra time and announce to the priests, "The Sadyaskra is today."
22.3.2	Dhananjaya says that one should send it before.
22.3.3	All the rites from the consecration onwards should be performed on the same day for the first two and the Svyen sacrifices.
22.3.4	The six ending with Ekāntā are so called because of the similarity of the Śaucivaṃśa.
22.3.5	The Urvarā is the Vedi in the first.
22.3.6	The Urvara is the ripe barley or the Vṛihi or the Urad.
22.3.7	From that very place, they should cut out the Uttaravedi.
22.3.8	The wooden post in the Khala becomes the post for the plough.
22.3.9	The Kalāpa is the part of the vessel.
22.3.10	If one were to perform the sacrifice at the time of barley or wheat, then after sowing the grains in the vessels, they should be ploughed.
22.3.11	The vessels of grains should be the northern altar.
22.3.12	The vessel of Soma should be the eastern altar.
22.3.13	A bull with three cows is called "with many cows." A bull with three cows means a bull with three years of age.
22.3.14	One who milks three cows.
22.3.15	A bull should have three years of age.
22.3.16	The Hotr should be placed in front, the Udgâtri in the east, the Adhvaryu in the west, and the Brahman in the south.
22.3.17	They should stay in front of them.
22.3.18	There they should tell them about the Soma, and they should go by chariot.
22.3.19	The Brahman should not speak about the road.
22.3.20	Sândilya says that the priests should do it.
22.3.21	The other Brahmanas should be invited to the Soma-sacrifice.
22.3.22	He performs the Sadya-kriya sacrifice. I shall tell you. To Indra, to all the gods, to Brahmanas, to Somas, to Soma-drinkers.
22.3.23	The chariots should be filled with milk and curd. The chariots should be filled on the Sadya day with milk and curd.
22.3.24	Then this (priest) should recite the Navanīta (hymn) or the foam (hymn) should be recited in the ghee.
22.3.25	A white horse should be given as Dakṣiṇā to the Udgātṛ.
22.3.26	A little bit to the others.
22.4.1	The Uttara (Sāman) is explained by this (Sāman). The horse is the twenty-first Dakṣiṇās.
22.4.2	The horse is indeed the
22.4.3	One-night
22.4.4	Two-less, Anukrī.
22.4.5	They are the Angirasas. The buying is done on the day of the Adityas, so it is said.
22.4.6	Gautama says that the buying should be done on the last day of the month.
22.4.7	The buying is done immediately, so it is called. The Adityas say this, not the others.
22.4.8	The buying on the next day is called anukrīti.
22.4.9	Dhananjaya says that the buying is done on a day before the Upavasatha.
22.4.10	"The next day is the Sutiya (the day of Soma-pressing). Thus he says. The next day is the Pravara (the day of buying Soma). Thus they say. It will be so."
22.4.11	"He is bought immediately." This shows the first one is bought immediately.
22.4.12	Because of being two less, the Angirasas bought the inferior one. Therefore, it is called Anukri.
22.4.13	The horse is the one hundred and first Dakshina. The horse is indeed the one.
22.4.14	This is said to be the Vishvajit sacrifice, consisting of two days.
22.4.15	Dhananjaya says that it is to be performed for three days.
22.4.16	The first day is for the Devas, the second day is for the Sutyas, and the third day is the best.
22.4.17	The Dakshina should be given according to one's capacity, and the things that are most desired in that country should be given.
22.4.18	He should give all the Vedas and their supplements, says Dhananjaya.
22.4.19	The bed should be measured, the ascent to the kitchen, a pair of slaves, a measure of grain, a plough, and a cow.
22.5.1	The priests should choose the sons of the warriors who have taken vows, but not the sons of the Rishis.
22.5.2	Only those who are worthy, says Dhananjya.
22.5.3-7	If there are no trees or posts, one should churn the clarified butter. If there are many trees or posts, they should be cut down and a sacrificial post should be erected. Or a burning mound. "The mound is for the dead." One should make a mound for the dead. On the vehicle by which the dead are carried, one should make a mound.
22.5.8	The sacrificial post should have a cup-like top.
22.5.9	The priests, wearing red turbans and red garments, with girdles, should proceed, with their men, with their bows drawn.
22.5.10	In the Pavamāna (Stotra) one should recite the Rathantara in place of the Ekacchas (Stotras) in the Brihatī (Stotra). That is the place of the Bharhata (Stotras).
22.5.11	Thus it becomes in the Trica (Stotra).
22.5.12	In the absence of any prohibition, one may adopt the other. Thus, there is a slight modification.
22.5.13	Here, one should offer the fifth Barhaspatya hymn according to the Stoma.
22.5.14	It should be Purumandala, because it shows the destruction of enemies.
22.5.15	The teachers say that in the two northern verses of the Rathantara in the Prstha, there should be two feet. Because it is said, "In the opposite direction."
22.5.16	Gautama says that it is the Kakubha.
22.5.17	This shows the non-repetition of the Stoma.
22.5.18	One should perform the Brahma-sāman floating, and one should perform this in the Rks.
22.5.19	For there is no continuity of the Pavamānī verses in this place.
22.5.20	Nineteen are the Dakṣiṇās. One should give the nine groups, or else the enthusiasm of the Kaṇakhora, Knataka and Vaṇṭa.
22.5.21	They should generate red at the southern end of them.
22.5.22	In one place, they should do everything at once.
22.5.23	Gautama says, "One initiation, three Upasads."
22.5.24	Its Gayatri verse is "Oya ruce, the side of the sun."
22.5.25	Sandilya in Purujit.
22.5.26	In the middle of that, one should recite this verse: "O Soma, who possesses wealth."
22.5.27-32	The Prachi direction is the one towards which one goes. One should perform the Udbanshiya rite in this direction, lifting up the Gayatra side, says Lampakaayana. The Trika is the Bahispavamana, says Sandilya. The Pañca is the Madhyandin, the Sapta is the Arbha, and the Ekini is the other. One should perform the Trika. The Hotr and the Sama are the Trika. The Pavamana is the Trika. Or the Hotr and the Sāman are the Trika, and the Pavamana is also the Trika. It is the one that is accomplished with four more.
22.5.33	Two, two, three, five.
22.5.34	By the reverse order, his sixth.
22.5.35	A hundred is the Dakṣiṇā.
23.1.1	Those who are going to perform the Vratya Stoma, having kindled separate fires and having performed the sacrificial requisites, among them, he who is most learned in reciting, or if he is not available, one who has acquired wealth, they should initiate him at the Garhapatya.
23.1.2	They should also eat the oblations.
23.1.3	Because the expiation is stronger than the performance of the Jyotiṣa rite.
23.1.4	Just as the sacrifice is on the right side, and there are five Dakṣiṇās.
23.1.5	But when it is not completed, they are from Indra. Therefore, it is not authoritative.
23.1.6	Because it is stated as a fault after performing the Iṣṭi.
23.1.7	Because of the injunction of the Vrata-pratipada.
23.1.8	Just as Agni-ādheya is for the impure.
23.1.9	Those who have not performed the Upasad, Agniṣṭoma, and Sattra, and have not performed the Stotras again, should perform them.
23.1.10	Those who are Vratyas should perform the first sacrifice.
23.1.11	The others are mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa.
23.1.12	Those who have become old and have lost their ability to procreate, they are the ones who have lost their semen.
23.1.13	If the householder were to adopt the Nirukta and the Nidhana, then he would be deprived of the Nidhana. Whose would this Brāhmaṇa be?
23.1.14	The teachers say that it is the prohibition of the Naudhasa.
23.1.15	Because of being the Nirukta Nidhana.
23.1.16	Or Indra, or heaven, or the Nidhana without the sun, they should adopt according to the injunction.
23.1.17	The Uṣṇīṣa and the Pratoḍa are the Uṣṇīsa and the Pratoṣa which are worn by the non-Brāhmaṇas.
23.1.18	The Vratyas go with their bows and arrows drawn, with the bow-string stretched.
23.1.19	The Vipatha and the Phalakāstīrṇa are the chariot yoked with horses and asses mixed together, says Śāṇḍilya.
23.2.5	If two are bought with one, then the two should be joined together. There should be a black and a white blanket.
23.2.6	The white blanket is called valakṣa.
23.2.7	The householder should take all this, including the silver and the householder.
23.2.8	There are thirty-three.
23.2.9	Dhananjaya says two sets of thirty-three.
23.2.10	The garments of the Valukas should be of cotton, those of the other castes should be of linen.
23.2.11	The garments of the Damadas should be of cotton.
23.2.12	The garments should be of cotton and linen.
23.2.13	Two garments should be of linen and two of cotton.
23.2.14	Two shoes should be of linen, two of cotton. The shoes of the Sandilyas should be black, those of the Dhananjayas should be of any colour.
23.2.15	The two words, “hating” and “benefiting” have been explained by the two words, “not hating” and “not benefiting”.
23.2.16	One should give it to the others as one.
23.2.17	And thirty-three.
23.2.18	The householder should approach with thirty-three. Thus it is said.
23.2.19	They should give thirty-three to the priests.
23.2.20	Those who are not free from the conduct of the Vratyas, or those who are related to Brahmins, or those who belong to the Magadha country, should give the wealth of the Vratya.
23.2.21	Those who give this (wealth) should go to the place where it is being cleaned.
23.2.22	Having performed the rites, they should engage in the livelihood of the Trividya (Veda).
23.2.23	Thereafter, he should eat and perform sacrifices for them.
23.3.1	The six Agniṣṭomas.
23.3.2	The Trivṛt and Jyotiṣṭoma are the first two, because of the difference in the desire for the option of the Vāravantīya.
23.3.3	Or not, because of the absence of distinction.
23.3.4	And the Vāravantyā is transferred to the other.
23.3.5	And because of the difference of the Anuvāka in the Kratus.
23.3.6	The teachers say that there are four.
23.3.7	Because of the repetition, the Trivṛt Jyotiṣṭomas.
23.3.8	And for all of them the first Anuvāka is like the Gavāmayana.
23.3.9	There is no difference in the Anuvākas because of the difference in the sacrifices, as in the case of the Jyotiṣṭoma, and as in the case the Caturmāsyavājapeya, Rājasūya, and Gargatris.
23.3.10	In these, one should give according to one's ability, such as oxen, horses, and goats. Similarly, one should give gold.
23.3.11	One who is worthy of a certain object but does not obtain it, should perform the Trivṛt sacrifice in the first (stage). His Dakṣiṇā should be a chariot with four wheels and horses. Among them, one should be black.
23.3.12	One whom the Brahmanas along with the king honour, should perform the Brihaspati Savana sacrifice.
23.3.13	At the morning pressing of that sacrifice, when the Nārāśamsa verses have been recited, he directs eleven Dakṣiṇās.
23.3.14	He should not offer to the priests.
23.3.15	Twelve horses at midday.
23.3.16	He offers them both.
23.3.17	Eleven at the third pressing. When the oblation for the dead has been offered, he should offer them. They would be eleven hundred or eleven thousand.
23.3.18	But the horse is always offered at midday.
23.3.19	He who would thus proceed with the recitation of the text, should proceed with them thereafter.
23.3.20	And they would call him the 'Sthapati'.
23.3.21	The hawk is explained as the arrow.
23.3.22	The Diksa and Upasads are the one-day rites.
23.4.1	One who is going to perform the Sarvasvara sacrifice should prepare from the Diksa onwards, so that he may be able to perform the Parayana on the Sauti day.
23.4.2	He should eat all kinds of food, including those that are harmful to life.
23.4.3	He should eat them with water or sprinkle them with water.
23.4.4	Having mixed Soma with water, they should take it to the place of Marjalyas.
23.4.5	When the Pavamāna hymn is being chanted in the Ārbhava Sāman, one should spread the skin of a black antelope on the southern side of the Udumbara tree, lie down with the head towards the south, and cover oneself. Then one attains that (heaven) and dies there.
23.4.6	Śāṇḍilī says that the sacrificer who has died should be taken to the Āhavanīya fire along with the oblations and the sacrificial vessels, and then one should proceed.
23.4.7	The Dhananjaya-s say that the remaining rites should be concluded.
23.4.8	If the rites are concluded, the Ne-disthe of the Sandilyayana-s should give up the Krsnajin and perform the rites for the patron and partake of the oblations.
23.4.9	The Ritvi-s should perform the rites for patron and offer all the oblations. This is the view of the Dhananjaya- s.

If one goes to the Āhavanīya first, one should know that one will go to the world of Brahman; if to the Garhapatya, to the world of gods; if to the Dakṣiṇāgni, to the world of the ancestors.
23.4.36	Thus, the one who is consecrated with the sacrificial vessels should be sung by the one who knows the three Vedas, "In the heaven, the bird."
23.4.37	"The smoke rises, it is you, O smoke, the one who knows."
23.4.38	When the fire is burning, one should say, "You are the kindling fire, the great one."

25.2.23	Brahmins should not shave the hair of the people of this country.
25.2.24	And they should not cut the hair of horses.
25.2.25	Nor should they cut the teeth of the horse-hair brushes.
25.2.26	Nor should there be a stream of water.
25.2.27	But Brahmins should do as they wish, and those who follow them.
25.3.1	One should consecrate oneself for the cutting of hair after a year, at the time when one should perform the consecration sacrifice.
25.3.2	On the full moon day, there is an Atiratra sacrifice.
25.3.3	Dhananjaya says that one should perform the Keśavapaniya sacrifice in the same Uttarapāksa in which one has performed the Dashapayi sacrifice.
25.3.4	The Atiratra is performed on the full moon day.
25.3.5	The Dakshina is one thousand.
25.3.6	After performing the Udasananiya Iṣṭi, one should initiate for the Vyati-Dvi-Rātra on the full moon, if one desires to perform it on the previous day of the new moon.
25.3.7	If it is said that it is on the full moon day, then one should initiate on the preceding fortnight.
25.3.8	In both cases, the subsequent day is to be offered.
25.3.9	If it is said that the subsequent day is on the new moon day, then they say that the first three new moon days are the new moon days.
25.3.10	Both should be in the preceding fortnight, because it is said that they are in the same fortnight.
25.3.11	The Dakṣiṇās have been explained by the preceding.
25.3.12	If there is room for the sacrifice of the Kṣatriya in that very former alternative, then it should be performed.
25.3.13	If there is no room for the latter alternative in the former, then it should not be performed.
25.3.14	It has been explained in the context of Abhiarohaniya.
25.3.15	Gautama and Dhananjaya say that the Dakṣiṇā should be given separately in these two cases.
25.3.16	And two thousand in the case of Keshapani.
25.3.17	Similarly in the case of Vyushta.
25.3.18	Four are to be given to the needy, Gautama gives five, Dhananjaya gives.
25.3.19	Always the wealth of the helpless relatives is given.
25.3.20	One should give the kingdom and twenty-one classes according to one's ability.
25.3.21	One should offer the bull of Indra in front and above.
25.3.22	The king desiring the kingdom should offer this sacrifice.
25.3.23	One should make Viras and ten classes and give according to one' ability.
25.3.24	One should offer the animal to Agni on the east and above.
25.3.25	One should offer the animal dedicated to Visvedevas on the day of Upavasatha.
25.3.26	The Dakshina for this is 2400.
25.3.27	Having performed the rites for the elders of the eastern quarter, one should perform the rites for the younger ones. If one is going to return to them, one should perform with the Puna-stoma.
25.3.28	The Dakshinā for this is twelve pairs. This is said by Dhananjaya.
25.3.29	Again, the chariot is made, the grass is spread again, the cow is given again, and the calf is given again. This is the opinion of Śāṇḍilya.
25.3.30	One should give these according to one's enthusiasm.
25.3.31	In the case of sheep with one horn, one should give according to one' s enthusiasm in the first sacrifice.
25.3.32	In the second sacrifice, one should give to both.
25.4.1	One should perform the Udbhid and Balabhid sacrifices without separation.
25.4.2	Both of them would have seven kinds of release.
25.4.3	And there would be a half-month interval between them.
25.4.4	A month or a year.
25.4.5	There is an Isti there.
25.4.7	Both of them have separate four-yoked chariots and horses, and both have bronze armour.
25.4.8	Horses should be worth a hundred, or a hundredfold.
25.4.9	One should offer these two sacrifices, says Sandilya.
25.4.10	He who is desirous of wealth is Dhananjaya.
25.4.11	The method for Agni Stoma is mentioned in the Ekāhika Vrata.
25.4.12	For each of them, there are four kinds of grain offerings as Dakṣiṇā.
25.4.13	Six cows in the east and four cows in the north.
25.4.14	Twelve hundred bulls and a thousand buffaloes are the Dakṣiṇās.
25.4.15-18	If there are not enough bulls, some of the others may be steers, or young bulls. If the king and his subjects honour a Vaishya, he should perform the Go-savena sacrifice. It has been explained in the Brihaspati-savena sacrifice.
25.4.19	The Dakṣiṇās are as follows: Five Śāradīya animals are offered. They should be given according to one's capacity.
25.4.20	Those who have this and that, says Dhānajitya.
25.4.21	The Kula Dakṣiṇā is for Indra and Agni. The Kula is for Indra and Agnis.
25.4.22	A thousand is for Indra.
25.4.23	The king and the royal priest should offer with the Stoma of Indra and Agni.
25.4.24	The Brāhmaṇa should give the Dakṣiṇā of the Gāyatrī metre, the king of the Jagatī metre.
25.4.25	If one desires to perform separately, one should do so.
25.4.26	The Dakṣiṇās are the same for both.
25.4.27	One desiring cattle or one who is practising sorcery should perform the Viṣaṇā sacrifice.
25.4.28	One desiring prosperity should perform the Atharvaṇa Soma Sāman sacrifice. One practising sorcery should perform it.
25.4.29-34	The Dakshina of one desiring cattle is the Brihatisampanna. The two, the arrow and the thunderbolt, are explained in the context of attacking with the arrow. The two are the sandamsa and the vajra. One should attack a king with the sandamsa and a country with the vajra. One should use them in reverse order when attacking a king. One should perform the Jyotishtoma sacrifice at the end for the purpose of peace. For the purpose of peace.
26.1.1	The Full-moon sacrifice, the Initiation, the Apvarga, and the Ahina sacrifices are performed.
26.1.2	Of these, the Dvādaśopaśa, the Ṣaḍaiti, and the Dhānajāyyā are performed.
26.1.3	On the twenty-first day, the Yajñapuccha is performed, or on the thirtieth day.
26.1.4	If there is a rise in the number of days, the initiation is reduced.
26.1.5	All the Atiratra sacrifices, the Ahina sacrifices, and the Ahargas beginning with the Dvāirātra are performed.
26.1.6	Except for the Cāturmāsya and the Rājasūya.
26.1.7	Because of the interruption of the recitation of the Ṛgveda and because of the absence of the characteristics.
26.1.8	Their special night is Panna, Panna, Srotaka, Daivodasa, Hotṛṣāma, Kautsa, Lokāṣṭādaṃṣṭa, Tvamāviśantva.
26.1.9	Those other than the horse sacrifice have a thousand as the fee before the four-night sacrifice.
26.1.10	From that onwards, the number of days increases by one.
26.1.11	Some say that it is 33 and 300 days, because of the vision of the end of creation.
26.1.12	Others say that it is the number of days from 25 to 1000.
26.1.13	Thus, the number of years is 10,000 in the Paundarika.
26.1.14	Dividing them equally among all the days, one should give.
26.1.15	On the last day of the Samayanupatta, the gifts are to be given in abundance.
26.1.16	On the eleventh day, one should give ten thousand, nine hundred on the previous days, and one thousand on the last day.
26.1.17	On the first day of the three-day ritual, one should give to those who perform the Vasatkaras and the Gravastutas.
26.1.18	To the Chandogas on the last day,
26.1.19	To the others in the middle,
26.1.20	One should give one hundred to the middle performers.
26.2.2	The ten are mentioned by the Brahman to the ten sages and preachers.
26.2.3	Anūcāna is the earlier one, Ananūcāna is in the later part of the day.
26.2.4	One should give a hundred to the students, or to the officiating priests.
26.2.5	The thousandth one with sixteen parts is given to the Brahman and the Agnidhra on the middle day.
26.2.6	White, black, and red are its forms.
26.2.7	The ten Kalas are for Brahma, the five Agnis for Grai.
26.2.8	One should perform the Ekāma sacrifice.
26.2.9	Having bought it with another cow, one should recite the desired mantra into the right ear of the cow, and then release it among the cows.
26.2.10	The Jyotistoma ritual is an integral part of the Dvādaśāha sacrifice, as indicated by the subsequent mention.
26.2.11	And because of the indication of that, just as in the case of the Prsthya sacrifices.
26.2.12	And because of the repetition, there is no connection with the Ahyina and other sacrifices.
26.2.13	For the connection would be like that of the Uphavya and the Rtapeyya, which are mentioned in different contexts.
26.2.14	And the mention of the Linga is for some other purpose, as in the case of the Shakaris on the sixth day.
26.2.15	The repetition is the injunction of the remainder.
26.2.16	In that independent case, the night would be deficient, because the deficiency is mentioned without any distinction.
26.2.17	But it would be natural, because of the mention in the context.
26.2.18	The injunction without distinction is in the case of the remainder, as in the case of four Avats.
26.2.19	What is said by Enka is that the mention is by the Rathantara.
26.2.20	And because the meaning of the word is impossible.
26.2.21	The union of the two is like the Apghāṭila.
26.2.22	The word "vāg" etc. is only a change of place.
26.2.23	As in the case of Vāmadevya and Yajñāyajñiya.
26.3.1	The Garbha-s are performed in the Apto-ryama.
26.3.2	The Rathantara is the Prstha. In its place, the Vārahita Vāji-jit.
26.3.3	In the northern Prstha, the Brihat and Vāravantiya.
26.3.4	The Vāravantiyam is in the Raksu of Kāleyas.
26.3.5	In its place, the former.
26.3.6	The Kāleyas and the Pauśanas are in the Samanta and the Pārtha respectively.
26.3.7	Those very (verses) are the embryos in the back.
26.3.8	One should place the embryos in the butter-offerings in the butter-sacrifices, says Dhananjaya. The verses of the sixth (day) in the verses of the Uktha.
26.3.9	Just as according to the method of the Arsheyaka, says Sandilya.
26.3.10	One should add the extra Stotras in the Jyotistoma Vatirastra, says the sixteenth (day).
26.3.11	Those very Garbha-s are in the back. The Yajñāyajñiya and the Bṛhat-garbha are in the front.
26.3.12	In the Ekastomas, the Svāstotra-Atiratra should be in the Vaitra-tri-night. Thus the junction.
26.3.13	Because both proceed without any change.
26.3.14	And the exclusion of the Trivṛt is not possible in any other junction.
26.3.15	The Atiratra with Trivṛt, thus the injunction without any distinction.
26.3.16	And the expectation of a livelihood is not found in the case of a word ending in a case-ending, as in the case of the sixteenth night, the first night, etc.
26.3.17	Some teachers say that this is also the case with the highest (case-ending).
26.3.18	The meaning is stated. The combination of two meanings, or repetition.
26.3.19	The twenty-one cases are mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa text.
26.3.20	The Ahīnastoma is mentioned because of the authority.
26.3.21	And it is not said that one is not mentioned.
26.3.22	The Ekavimsa stoma is superior to the Uktha stomas. It is not proper.
26.3.23	The Samputrishi says so.
26.3.24	The Ekavimsa and Pañcadaśa stomas are the two middle stomas of the two Ahina sacrifices.
26.3.25	Having placed the fire, they praise the Brahmanas and the Ajyadohas.
26.3.26	They should keep the fire at the Hotr's place on the first day, and bring it to the middle of the day.
26.3.27	The morning Savana is for the two later ones.
26.3.28	They should light it at the time of the Stotra.
26.4.1	One desiring a thousandfold increase should perform the Shabali Homa.
26.4.2	Dhananjaya says that one should not perform the Triratra sacrifice.
26.4.3	For he says that one should perform the Triratras.
26.4.4	One who desires a thousand cows should do this, says Śāṇḍilya.
26.4.5	One who is satisfied with food should not eat food, says the Veda.
26.4.6	In spring, on the first day of the bright fortnight, having shaved the hair and beard, wearing new clothes, one should drink hot milk for twelve nights, lying down on a mound that is not covered.
26.4.7	The fire should be kept burning in his house.
26.4.8	No other friend or relative should enter his house.
26.4.9	He should speak little.
26.4.10	He should not go far.
26.4.11	Having performed the Upasad rites on the twelfth day, having spread the fire, the sacrificial post should be of Ficus glomerata, the ladle and the spoon also should be of the same wood. Having brought curds, honey and clarified butter in that (vessel), one should take them with the ladle and the vessel. One should offer four or eight spoonfuls of clarified butter with the mantra, "Thou art the thunderbolt, the ocean."
26.4.12	With the utterance of "Svaha" one should offer the northern part.
26.4.13	If there is any remnant in the ladle, one should take it in a goblet and eat it.
26.4.14	Having washed the ladle, the spoon and the goblet, one should put them down.
26.4.15	Here itself one should offer the oblation. This is the view of Śāṇḍilyāyana.
26.4.16	Having gone out of the village towards the east or north, and having gone to the forest where one does not hear the sound of a domestic animal, having worshipped the clump of Darbha grass there, one should cry three times with a throat-throbbing sound, "Shabali, Shabali."
26.4.17	If another dog or donkey responds, one should know that the rite has been accomplished.
27.1.2	The means of attaining it is as described in the Mahāvrata of the Gautamaya.
27.1.3	The Upasads are the means of attaining it.
27.1.4	Having been initiated, one should release a white horse.
27.1.5	The form of the black circle is the eye.
27.1.6	He who is endowed with speed.
27.1.7	Having protected for a year from the directions, they should bind him in the king's purchase.
27.1.8	Dhananjaya says that the spring season is the beginning of the year. Shandilya says that the summer season is the beginning.
27.1.9	On the seventh or eighth day of either Chaitra or Vaishakha, after feeding the officiating priests who perform the rites in the middle, one should give them separate thousands.
27.1.10	On the full moon day of Pushya, one should release a horse if the ritual has been performed extensively or if it has been completed.
27.1.12	There are three Iṣṭis, which are Savitrī.
27.1.13	When they are established, the sacrificer and the Hotṛ sit facing east on a golden seat to the south of the Āhavanīya fire.
27.1.14	One should listen to the Hotr reciting the Parīplāva verses every day for a year.
27.1.15	The Adhvaryu sits facing west on a golden plate.
27.1.16	The Udgātṛ priest should sit facing the north.
27.1.17	One should give a hundred to the Hotṛ priest and ten to the Adhvaryu priest, or a thousand to the Hotṛ and a hundred to the Adh-varyu.
27.1.18	A little to the other two.
27.1.19	His divine vows are as in the Rājasūya.
27.1.20	After a year, having bound the horse, one should initiate.
27.1.21	On that day, the other priests should take their seats as per their respective positions.
27.1.22	He has twelve consecratory rites and the Upasads.
27.1.23	They should chant the Bahispavamāna hymns outside all the morning sessions.
27.2.1	At the middle session, having offered the head of the horse, they should chant the Bahispāvamāna hymns in the form of a serpent.
27.2.2	While the chanting is going on, the sacrificer should tell the Udgātṛ, "O Udgātṛ! I choose you with a hundred gold coins. The horse will be chanted by you."
27.2.3	Having crossed the horse and having shown the mare, they should show the mare.
27.2.4	When the mare neighs, the sacrificer should say to the Udgātṛ, "O Udgātṛ! I choose you with a hundred and a gold coin. You alone will chant for me."
27.2.5	Having crossed the horse and sitting down, the Udgātā should chant with the Aśvavrata hymn, "Abhivājī Viśvarūpa" with the Trica verse.
27.2.6	Having sat down on the seat of Hiranyakashipu, he should praise with the Bahispavamana hymn and then offer it.
27.2.7	She who is the most beloved wife of the sacrificer, she alone is the one who is praised.
27.2.8	The daughter of a king, who is not yet married, is the one who praises.
27.2.9	When the animals have been designated and the Hotr priests have been appointed, the Brahman priest should appoint the one who praises.
27.2.10-11	When he is carrying a load on his back, let him be directed to the north. When it is cold and windy, let him be again directed to the south. His daughters, a hundred in number, should be his attendants. They should direct him to the north when he is carrying a burden on his back, and when it is cold and stormy, they should direct him to the south.
27.2.12	The Udgātṛ should recite the verse, "The Udgātṛ has recited the verse, 'What is the thick and hairy, the two testicles of her, the cow, the two breasts, the two nipples.' He should point out.
27.2.13	Her hundred daughters, the leaders of the Sūtas, should recite the verse in reply, 'The gods have entered the shining light.' They should point out.
27.2.14	The woman is pointed out by the foot, as the eye of truth.
27.2.15	Having touched water, they should recite the Vamadevya hymn and recite its verses.
27.3.1	Having performed the rite with the Svāhā form, sitting together in the east, they should speak about the Vedas.
27.3.2	When the Adhvaryu has spoken, the Brahman should ask the Udgātṛ, "I ask you, O friend of the gods, if you know in your mind, in which of the three steps of Viṣṇu the entire universe has entered."
27.3.3	He should reply to him, “In those three verses, the entire universe entered at once. I roam the earth and heaven with one part of my body. The back of heaven is his body.”
27.3.4	The Udgātṛ asks the Brahman, "Who has entered the inner chamber? What has been entrusted to the inner chamber? O Brahman, we are following you. What shall we reply here?"
27.3.5	He should reply, "The five (elements) have entered the inner person. Those (elements) are entrusted to the inner person. He who is reflecting on this, may not be affected by the illusion of Bhava. May there be prosperity above."
27.3.6	All should ask the sacrificer, "We ask you, O Vrisha, the semen of the horse. We ask the supreme space of speech."
27.3.7	To them he should say, "This is the altar, the highest point of the earth, the navel of the universe, this Soma is the seed of the horse of the Vrishnas, this Brahma is the highest space of speech."
27.3.8	On the first day, he should give a thousand as Dakshina. Similarly on the last day.
27.3.9	On the middle day, if it is in a single country, he should give the wealth of non-Brahmanas.
27.3.10	Or he may perform the sacrifice in the middle of the conquered territory.
27.3.11	He should give the eastern direction to the Hotṛ, the southern to the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, and the northern to the Udgātṛ.
27.3.12	Whatever is left over from the two considerations of the territory and the men.
27.3.13	Or as long as they say, "We do not want more than this."
27.3.14	He should give to the performers forty-eight thousand or one hundred thousand in the middle. To each of the twenty-four performers, twelve to each of the third performers, and six to each of the foot performers.
27.3.15	These are the minimum. One may give more if one wishes.
27.3.16	There are options in this.
27.3.17	One may perform these fifteen stomas for five days.
27.4.1	That is the Patantuka horse sacrifice.
27.4.2	In the first Bahispavamāna of that, one should recite three anuṣṭubh verses of Viṣṇu in four parts.
27.4.3	In the previous example, there are three anuṣṭhubh verses of Viṇu, as it is said.
27.4.4	But one should recite the Gāyatrī verses of Pavamāna because of the impossibility of yoking.
27.4.5	This is the reason because of the example in the original.
27.4.6	And because the three and four are mentioned in the context of the Vaishvadevya sacrifice, it is established that the three and four refer to the Gāyatrī verses.
27.4.7	All the verses of the Bahispavamāna are to be sung in the Gāyatrīs.
27.4.8	Because the arrangement is made in sets of four.
27.4.9	Having grazed the horse for half a month, one should offer it with this.
27.4.10	The Atiratra sacrifice of that (horse sacrifice) should be the third day, and one should perform it for a month.
27.4.11	Or one should offer a cow with that (Atiratra) for three months.
27.4.12	The life-force is the sixth.
27.4.13	Of these natural days, the third day would be a little less.
27.4.14	Of the Vaisvañara and Abhijit sacrifices, the Atiratra days are to be performed.
27.4.15	For them, the Stoma-insistence would be as in the case of the Catuṣṭoma and Sarvas toma.
27.4.16	In the case of the two-day and three-day sacrifices, there is no omission of the procedure, due to the authority of the word "Brahmana".
27.4.17	By that alone the Jagati was created. Those who composed the two-day sacrifice, they healed him with these Sama hymns. This indeed is the three-day sacrifice. These forms are the daily offerings of clarified butter.
27.4.18	Because of the absence of movement and the formation of groups.
27.4.19	The first day of the Trirātra is called Aṣṭīva, and the last day is called Aṣțīva, and there is a gap in between.
27.4.20	But the ordinary ones are not so, because they have been defined as such, and they are going to be discussed later on.
27.4.21	For example, in the case of the Vrata, which lasts for five days, the sixth day is called Āyuṣkāma, and in the case of Saptarātra, the seventh day is called Āyuskama.
27.4.22	The Stoma is determined by the direct statement, as in the case of the Catuṣṭoma and Sarva-stoma.
27.4.23	The omission of the Tantra is due to the statement, as in Jāmi Kalpa in the case of all Svara.
27.4.24	The Stomas of the first day should be Catuṣka and others, increasing by four, ending with Aṣṭācatvāriṃśa, says Lāmakāyana.
27.5.1	This is the Aśvamedha of Govīnat.
27.5.2	Thus the first day is the entire Chandoma, the middle one is the entire animal sacrifice, and the last one is the entire Stoma.
27.5.3	The Viraj has six more (verses).
27.5.4	If one wishes to perform it, one should perform the Trinava Uktha and the Ekavimsa.
27.5.5	The Stoma Pratyavaroha is not like this according to Sandilya.
27.5.6	Having performed the horse-sacrifice for a year, he should offer six animal-sacrifices in the two seasons of death, namely, the Agniya, the Indra, the Maruta, the Parjanya, the Maitravaruna, the Indra-Brhaspati, and the Indra-Visnu.
27.5.7	On the thirteenth day of the dark fortnight, one should initiate for Jamadagni. The Dakṣiṇā is twenty (cows). There are twelve Upasads.
27.5.8	At the Upasads, the Adhvaryu should offer separate cooked rice oblations. They are mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa.
27.5.9	The morning and evening oblations have the same deity.
27.5.10	These oblations begin with "Agni's Hotr."
27.5.11	Having performed the Avabhṛtha, one should offer sacrifices with Iṣṭis for twelve days.
27.5.12	In these, the Puronuvākyās are in the reverse order.
27.5.13	On the fourth day when the Sāṃsarpas are performed, one should arrange the Brhatī and Anuṣṭubh separately in the reverse order, saying, "For the mother of Vasīṣṭha."
27.5.14	Because the fourth is the place of the mother.
27.5.15	Or because of the similarity of the metres, the Rathantara and Brhatī.
27.5.16	The Rathantara is mentioned in the Vasishtha and Prajanana.
27.5.17	Some say that they are Barhaspatya.
27.5.18	There would be an option between them by the rule of the Arsheyaka.
27.5.19	One should sacrifice with the animal-binding of the five autumnal months, which are mentioned in the Brahmana.
27.5.20	On the seventh or eighth day of the autumnal fortnight.
27.5.21	They should anoint with the skin of a calf and release the cow.
27.5.22	He would create as many other sacrifices as there are sacrifices in the above. He would perform those sacrifices for that many years.
27.5.23	In the sixth month of autumn, i.e., in the month of Kārttika, one should perform the sacrifice. It has twelve Upasads.
27.6.1	In the second day of the two Parayā sacrifices, Gautama performed the Pārtha sacrifice from the Samūha.
27.6.2	And due to the connection of the Chāras, in the Pauṇḍarīka.
27.6.3	Vasishtha, Sandilya, because of non-application in the sixth.
27.6.4	And because of the movement, in the form of a collection.
27.6.5	In the third three-day period, the Ukthas of the fifth day should be in reverse order, say the teachers.
27.6.6	Because there is repetition here, as in the five-day period of the gods.
27.6.7	Or twenty-seven, because of the omission.
27.6.8	The Stoma performed at night is the Pratyavaroha, says Gautama.
27.6.9	Because of being the remnant of the Savanas, the Ukthas should be only thirty-three.
27.6.10	In the first of the seven-day rituals, there are twenty-five Stotras because of being Hastostomas.
27.6.11	But they are twenty-one because of being a part of the Jyotishtoma.
27.6.12	The Stotras should be seventeen because of being related to the Stoma, due to authority.
27.6.13	And as the Ekavimsa is connected with the Sodasi, which is a combination of Stomas.
27.6.14	The Ekavimsa has twenty-one Stomas, because of the connection with the Sodasi.
27.6.15	The Pañcavimsa, the Sauciva, the Vrishi, the Trinava, the Vady and the Sodasi are connected with the Stoma.
27.6.16	As in the Paundarika, the sixth Sodasi is absent, so also in the Kshullka Jamadagni.
27.6.17	And when the Ekavimsa is performed, it is a sacrifice of a hundred Ekavimsa Brihatis, as mentioned in the Svayambhuva.
27.6.18	But if it were performed with the Sodashin, there would be no division.
27.6.19	Or in the Viraj and Apaya, or in other (sacrifices).
27.6.20	Because of the absence of Apaya, in the Kshullka Jamadagni.
27.6.21	And because of the prosperity, it is enjoined.
27.6.22	And it is also suitable in the Dashahara.
27.6.23	And the thirty-six are fixed. For there are six hundred Brihatī verses.
27.6.24	The Catuṣṭoma is so called because of the restriction of the Jyotiṣṭoma.
27.6.25	But in the case of the Visaya, it is due to the influence of the original and the derivative.
27.6.26	But in that case, the Catuṣṭomayajña is prior to the Catuṣtoma, and the Pāśukāmayajña is posterior to it.
27.6.27	In the case of the influence of the latter, the principle is applicable.
27.6.28	Because of the restriction of a single verse in the Agniṣṭoma Sāman.
27.6.29	Because of the statement that there is no Agniṣṭoma in the four (sacrifices).
27.6.30	And as in the Aśvatara-tri-night.
27.6.31	The teachers say that because of the statement that all (sacrifices) are to be imagined as having the Agniṣṭoma as their place.
27.6.32	Not so in the Aśva-tri-night (sacrifice).
27.6.33	Because of the absence of a statement, the natural state (prevails).
27.6.34	Because of being the twelfth Stotra, it is the Agniṣṭoman.
27.6.35	There should be no performance of the Ahīna sacrifice, because there is a censure in the Bahvṛca Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa.
27.6.36	The serpent, indeed, having become this, recites the sacrificial rite. He who performs the sacrifice with the serpent, recites the rite.
27.6.37	The sacrifice is performed by the creator.
27.6.38	The Kapiyas recite the hymn, "The eldest son of Jyestha, being praised, is Citraratha." There is no fault in this.
27.6.39	As they perform for the dead.
27.6.40	Both the officiating priests and the sacrificer perform the sacrifice. This is the Brāhmaṇa.
28.1.1	The initiation, purchase, and production should be performed in all sacrifices in the first half.
28.1.2	If one of them is not possible, the purchase should be done in the second half.
28.1.3	And the production, if there are two.
28.1.4	The production alone should be done in both halves.
28.1.5	There are twelve initiations and upasads in the absence of instructions.
28.1.6	And for those who are in the same year.
28.1.7	Beyond that, the initiations are optional.
28.1.8	In the first, there are fifteen nights and nineteen consecrations, says Dhānajitya.
28.1.9	The Ekāṣṭaka, Mahāvrata, and Amāvāsyā-Atirātra are mentioned.
28.1.10	Gautama mentions eighteen, saying that the Pūrṇamāsyā-Atrātra is mentioned.
28.1.11	Or it may be according to the Jaatika Kalpa.
28.1.12	From sixteen nights up to thirty nights, there are eighteen consecrations and fifty-one nights.
28.1.13-16	The twelve-day sacrifice and others. One should perform it with the Ahiranliṅga (ritual). Because this shows the Brahman in the form of Ahiranliṅgas. As one performs the one-day sacrifice with the twelve-day sacrifice, one who is performing the Ahiranliṃga sacrifice stands in front of the sacrificer. One who is performing the sacrifice with the Ahiranliniga is increasing the sacrificer. "One who desires a thousand (cows) should offer a thousand (cows). One who desires a hundred (cows) should give a hundred (cows). One should give a hundred and one (cows) to the sacrificer."
28.1.17	There are innumerable signs of the sacrifice.
28.1.18	In the first day, one should perform the Brahma-sāman with one syllable, and in the third day, one should do the Audasa-sāman.
28.1.19	Its Uṣṇiha-sāman should have one syllable as the final syllable.
28.1.20	Or the Audasa-samans.
28.1.21	The Barhitas have no practice of the Uṣṇīsa-sāman in the third day.
28.1.22	Here, most of the Sāmans have more than one syllable as the concluding syllable.
28.1.23	There, one should perform Pauṣkala.
28.1.24	For the hymns here are mostly Jyotistoma-like.
28.1.25	And this is done for them in the Dasara-tra.
28.2.1	In the Shakvari-s, one should chant with the Sodashi-s. This would be the Gaurvitam in the Maha-namini-s.
28.2.2	For the injunction of the Rk-s is in that context.
28.2.3	And because of the secret nature, there is no indication.
28.2.4	Or the indication is because of the direction.
28.2.5	Or because of the authority and the Shakvari-s, it is said, "O Indra, accept."
28.2.6	The Mahānāmnī Sāman is to be used in the sixteen Sāmans.
28.2.7	For in these there is no other Sāman.
28.2.8	Even in the Prsthastotra-s, when one performs the Parokṣa-s, he does not perform them as in the Nitya-s.
28.2.9	For the Vajra has been performed in this place.
28.2.10	And since the Parokṣas are seen in their place, they are to be excluded.
28.2.11	But in the Vyatihara, the Jāmi-s and the Sañcāra-s would be there.
28.2.12	There may be the transference of both, because of the diversity of the two.
28.2.13	By this the methods are explained in the Brihat.
28.2.14	And also that which has the nature of transference.
28.2.15	In the Viraṭ and its own Anushtup, there should be the Gaurīvita.
28.2.16	There are sixteen Sāmans mostly in the Svaras.
28.2.17	One who performs the Gaurīvit in the Anushtup should perform the Purāmbhiṃdhu.
28.2.18	The Anushtubh metre is not found in the Saman. The two Samanas are found in the Stomas.
28.2.19	The Nidhanas are found in the Sakvaris. They are found in all places of the Idas. This is said by the teachers. It is most common.
28.2.20	Gautama and Dhananjaya say, "It is like the Udhasya."
28.2.21	Here he speaks about the Nidhanas.
28.2.22	"At the beginning" - this is said by Saucivarkshi. The change is less.
28.2.23	Because of the absence of any restriction, it should be done at all places where the sacrifice is concluded, says Sandilyāyana. So says Kauṭsa also.
28.2.24	Dhananjaya says that the Purīṣa should be joined with the Uttarayā Stotriyā.
28.2.25	Having praised with the Śakvarī verses, one should separate with the Purīṣas. You say that it should be done with the Purīșa. Therefore, it should not be joined.
28.2.26	On the fifth day, one should perform the Rāyovājiya Brahma-sāman, and perform it in the place of the Rāyavṛddhi.
28.2.27	One should perform the Bāhrhadgīra.
28.2.28	Because the Gega and the Saccandasi were seen on the same day in the forest.
28.2.29	Performing the Pārathuraśma, one should perform in the place of Bāhrhadgirī, for the continuity of the verses.
28.3.1	Some say that the tenth is not an Ananga, because it is a mental offering, and because it is offered to the wife of another.
28.3.2	For the place of the Stotra is here.
28.3.3	And it is said, "The Agniṣṭoma is surrounded by the Avabhrtha."
28.3.4	And he speaks of the creation of this Avabhrtha by means of a part.
28.3.5	But it would be an Anga, because of the mention of the authority.
28.3.6	And there is no independence of the Stotra, even though it is called "Astotrā."
28.3.7	The Agniṣṭoma and Avabṛtta are mentioned only as a matter of argument.
28.3.8	Just as the Ukthya is mentioned as the next to the Yajñakratu, so also the Atiratra is mentioned in the Gavamāyana.
28.3.9	And just as the Rathantara is not mentioned as a part of the Jyotiṣṭoma, so also the Sargas are not mentioned as parts of the sacrifice.
28.3.10	The Ācāryas say that if the Sodasi is performed at the Atiratras, where the Viraj is not prescribed or prohibited, it should be performed there.
28.3.11	Because it is performed at the Dvādaśāha, not at the Gavāmayana, and it is suitable there.
28.3.12	But the prosperity is without cause, because many Virajas are prosperous.
28.3.13	And there is no cause for the prescription of the new.
28.3.14	In all cases, the Aṣṭaśīti is to be performed in the original Sāmnīyī.
28.3.15	And having known the Aṣṭāśīti, one should not perform elsewhere, as the Atiratra and the Bahulā are obstructed by the Ṣoḍaśī.
28.3.16	But if one desires, the Atiratra may be performed in the Sāmnīyā, or with the Ṣoḷaśī. Thus it is.
28.3.17	Therefore, here also it should be done in the same way.
28.3.18	But the injunction and prohibition are for the purpose of restriction.
28.3.19	In the first thirteen-night Soma-sacrifice, the Chandomas are arranged in accordance with the order of the Somas, and also in accordance with the absence of the order of the Gaurivit.
28.3.20	According to the method of the Gavayanas, the Pratiprasthātṛ should arrange the Chandomas.
28.3.21	Because it is interrupted, it proceeds thus.
28.3.22	But like the Dasara-tra, because of the presence of Chandomas. The Pratiprasthātr should arrange the Chandoma.
28.3.23	Because of the absence of the arrangement and the Chandoma, and because of the absence of arrangement and the Chandomas, and because of their absence.
28.3.24	And like the Pratna, the first Bahispavamāna.
28.3.25	The other is the proper wife of this.
28.3.26	And the tenth meaning is seen in the absence of exclusion.
28.3.27	And the combination of nine.
28.3.28	And in the places of Abhivarta and Shyaitanaudhasa, in those very (verses).
28.3.29	As in the Ushnih, where it is well known.
28.3.30	But in its own (verses), the Avartin (verses) are (used).
28.3.31	As in Brihat, where the Vasatkara is the Nidhana, and in Brihat Rathantara, that is the sixth day.
28.3.32	The verses are in the present tense.
28.4.1	In the first twenty-one-night ritual, Shauchivrishi followed the reverse order of the third Abhiplva and the reverse order of Shauchivrisha.
28.4.2	Because there is no mention of repetition.
28.4.3	Shaandilya followed the reverse order in the two Abhiplvas because of the statement "two Abhiplvas".
28.4.4	The high and low places are at the equinox.
28.4.5	This shows that the Vidyats and others are to be performed on the third and sixth days of the month, and on the thirty-third day.
28.4.6	Some say that this shows that the rites of the higher classes are to be performed in the reverse order.
28.4.7	Gautama says that in the case of night-long sacrifices, the rites of the Abhiplvas should be performed in the same manner as in the case of the Samvatsara and other sacrifices.
28.4.8	The first of the five days of the first week is the Brhatī, and the second is the Jāmi.
28.4.9	But there is cessation due to the irregularity. In the five days of Abhijit, one should not commence.
28.4.10	Those five days of the Prsthya Stoma are one in the absence of instruction.
28.4.11	Because of the difference in the Brahman-sāman.
28.4.12	Because of being in the lineage of the Viśvajit.
28.4.13	Because of the omission of the sixth from the back.
28.4.14	Because of the statement "Jyotiragaurayu".
28.4.15	And because it is said, "They go with three, they rise with three."
28.4.16	These are equal.
28.4.17	Gautama alone says that they are only five days of Abhijit, because he is authorized in the sacrifices.
28.4.18	And the other is unseen.
28.4.19	And his repetition is not done even for the natural five days.
28.4.20	Because of the non-mention of the connection between Gauri and Vita.
28.4.21	In the fifth, because of the non-grasping of Abhiṣoma.
28.4.22	Atiratra, Jyotiṣṭoma, Gaurāyu, Gaurāyus, Pañcāha.
28.4.23	This is the second, this is the third. Here there is the final Brahmana.
28.4.24	This is Prātnā, Vāka, Jambha, Pañcāh, as the world, Bṛhad, Rathantara.
28.4.25	This is the ancient, the eastern, the Vakajambha, the northern.
28.4.26	The Visvajit is to be performed in the sixth month, as in the Apciti.
28.4.27	Or in the places of Prati-sthana, because there is no difference.
28.4.28	Or in Pavamana, because of the position of Apa-sthana.
28.4.29	But the Stomas should be Paristhika.
28.4.30	The Chandomas are composed for the Prstha.
28.5.1	At the Upasads of the Garhapatya fire, they should offer clarified butter in separate vessels, as prescribed in the Brāhmaṇa.
28.5.2	At the time of preparing for the Soma-pressing, they should sit to the east of the Havirdhāna shed and eat the Āñjīra and Abhyajīra dishes.
28.5.3	Gautama says that one should eat only at the Agnīdhriya shed.
28.5.4	Dhananjaya and Shandilya say that this should be done every day.
28.5.5	Gautama says that it should be done in every Stoma.
28.5.6	Some say that it should be in the Prishthya.
28.5.7	Some say in the Abhiplvas.
28.5.8	Some say, "The first should be the Dashahara-night Pravargya in the Samvatsara-Sammata."
28.5.9	Having mentioned the Pravargya, he takes up the Stoma-modification.
28.5.10	The Dasha-ratrikas do not have the use of the parts.
28.5.11	The teachers say that the Shaka-varna should be used when the Abhiplva is repeated, for the sake of the Saṃvatsarika substance.
28.5.12	The fourth Abhiplva is omitted, and it should be used with it, as the Janitra is used with the Pratiṣṭha.
28.5.13	The Santani is used first because of the repetition of the Sama.
28.5.14	The Apatya is used because of the combination.
28.5.15	But it would be yajña.
28.5.16	The place of the omission of the suffix in the case of the superlatives is above, and in the case of those that are repeated before, it is in the former case.
28.5.17	And this is seen in one case only.
28.5.18	This is what is meant in the case of sixty-one nights.
28.5.19	In the case of a hundred nights, they would be taking the same intention, and taking the same intention; and there would be an option.
28.5.20	As many as there are, and as they are, in the Sarasvata country, so are they in any other country, wherever they may be.
28.5.21	The teachers say that the wheels should be turned at the end of the day after performing the Uddhāraṇī of the Soma-pressing stones.
28.5.22	Because of non-going, there is sprinkling in the same place.
28.5.23	Dhananjaya and Śāṇḍilya say that this should be done every day.
28.5.24	Gautama says that the Abhiplva alone is to be performed.
28.5.25	Some say that the Prishthya alone is to be done.
28.5.26	Some say it is to be done in the Trikadruka.
28.5.27	The initiation for the Gavayana sacrifice is to be done at the time mentioned.
28.5.28	Vaishakha and Jyeshtha are optional, with the Caitra fortnight and Ashadha.
28.5.29	Having initiated on the sixth day, they should perform the initiation for seventeen days.
28.5.30	This is said to be the case when there is no instruction for those who are engaged in the year-long sacrifice.
29.1.1	The Barhīta verses are to be sung in the five Māsas. Thus they are the verses of the Abhivrttī Stotra.
29.1.2	Because they are heard in the context of the Brahma-sāman.
29.1.3	And the statement "one verse after another" indicates that they are different verses.
29.1.4	There are four hundred Barhītaverses in the Dasatayi.
29.1.5	The Brhat, Rathantara, and Kaleya Stotras, and the Indra-kratu are to be performed in other places.
29.1.6	One hundred and twenty-one verses should be performed in the twenty-fourth day, and the remaining verses in the other days.
29.1.7	The thirty-nine verses of the Satobarhata Stotra should be performed in every third day.
29.1.8	Because this place has been assigned by the Arsheyaka Kalpa.
29.1.9	In the fifth month, on the fifth day of the bright fortnight, one should perform the Satobṛhatī verses, beginning with the Pragaṭhas.
29.1.10	When they have been mastered, one should join them with the Chandaḥ verses, in the sixth month.
29.1.11	One should place the Gāyatrī verse at the beginning and the Uṣṇīsa verse at the end.
29.1.12	Otherwise, there would be a deficiency in the verses.
29.1.13	Gautama, having made eight by adding the remaining verses of the Satobāṛhī, says that they are to be combined.
29.1.14	Because they are recited by omitting the verses of the Brihatī.
29.1.15	One should compose with only four additional metres. Gautama says that one should compose the Gāyatrī in the twenty-fourth, the Uṣṇīṣa in the first Ābhiplava, the Anuṣṭubh in the second, and the Brihatī in the others.
29.1.16	The Brihatis should be recited from the fifth day, for the Pragaathas increase.
29.1.17	There, having made a Paṅkti, they reach the sixth month with the Tristubh, and the Jagati in the third Svarasani.
29.1.18	Now, the remaining verses of the Navasata and Barhaspatya are two Pragathas. Having made them, they should proceed to the Pankti. In the place of the best of them, the sixth, and above that, the Tristubh. This is said by Gautama.
29.1.19	It is said that it should be done with the Brihat and Tristubh.
29.1.20	One should make the Tristubh in the twenty-fourth, and the Brihat in the first Abhiplvika.
29.2.1	This is the reversal of all the verses.
29.2.2	These are the great varieties.
29.2.3	The application of four plus one is the reversal of the Brihatī and Tristubh verses. It should be in the sixth month, says Śaucivrīṣi.
29.2.4	"For this is like a battle of the metres," he says, and then he arranges it.
29.2.5	All of them, say the teachers.
29.2.6	The Brhatī metre is attained by the gradual use of four extra syllables in the middle.
29.2.7	It is said that the sixth month is in Trishtubh.
29.2.8	The reversal is due to the exhaustion of the Brhatī. It is appropriate there.
29.2.9	Saucivrīṣi says that the Brhatī is taken as optional.
29.2.10	Or the months are five.
29.2.11	Trishtubh is as much as the statement.
29.2.12	The Brihatis are not exhausted.
29.2.13	The eight Stotras of the Brihat and Rathantara are the remnants of the Satobarhaspatya.
29.2.14	One should interchange the Tristubh and Jagati.
29.2.15	If the Kalelya is the Tarani, then the Stotra of that day would be the Abhivart.
29.2.16	If the Rathantara is the Tvamiidhi, then the Stotras of that day would also be the Abhivart.
29.2.17	If the Svara and Rasa are different, then one should perform the Stotriya of Rathantara.
29.2.18	Because the other Rathantara has been performed there.
29.2.19	Thus the teachers have explained.
29.2.20	One may also recite twenty hundred Prastara verses and use them.
29.2.21	Because there is a restriction of four hundred.
29.2.22	There one should perform the Brihatis as before.
29.2.23	But one should omit the fifth day.
29.2.24	The reversal of the Śauciva tree is done by the improper (method).
29.2.25	The Kṛta Kriyā (rituals) are done again in the Bṛhad Rathaṃtara Kāleya Stotra Triya.
29.3.1	There are twenty-one hundred left, of which seven are Sata Bārhata and four are reversed.
29.3.2	The teachers say that the Trimsat and the other Stomas should be performed in the twenty-four and the highest Stomas.
29.3.3	For in the Abhivarta section it is heard, "This is also Abhivarta."
29.3.4	But if the six-pragatha is performed without this annual Kalpa, it should be done here also.
29.3.5	If they are found to be present on the third day when they are used together, then they should be used there.
29.3.6	If they are not found, then they should only be used in the Pragaatha.
29.3.7	Because it is improper to use the Satobrhatis on the sixth day, except on the third day.
29.3.8	If he were to perform the Stotriya hymns as he did before, then he should perform the Brahma-saman hymns with the Nidhanas at the Indrakratu. They are the Chhandasya hymns.
29.3.9	If the Chhandas hymns are not available, then other hymns with the Nidhana and Giti may be performed.
29.3.10	Thus, if the Indrakratu Pragaatha is neglected, one should perform the Saamani hymns, praising the one who is being praised without being struck.
29.3.11	Gautama says, one should not praise.
29.3.12	The Janitra is the Vishvajit.
29.3.13	Those which are in the Prsthya are in the Dashahara-Prsthya.
29.3.14	Four of them are in the Chandomas, according to their respective shares and according to the Prsthas.
29.3.15	The Purumilha is in the Vrata, the Shyaita.
29.3.16	The sixth month with the Atiratra and the Caturvimsa is in the earlier half.
29.3.17	The first of the two is performed in the first half of the month.
29.3.18	The two hymns of Gaurivit and Shyavasva are to be recited in the first half. The hymn of Nihav is to be recited in all the places of the cow-sacrifice.
29.3.19	Some say that the recitation of the hymn of Nihav should not be started.
29.3.20	The recitation of the hymn is done according to the rules of the Arshayaka Kalpa. The hymns of Gaurivat, Shyavasva and Nihav are recited.
29.3.21	The Brahmana would not be true.
29.4.1	All the priests would chant with the great vow. This would be a change in the Udgata.
29.4.2	Others are not heard.
29.4.3	And the word "all" is used for them.
29.4.4	Because of the association of the action, they would chant together.
29.4.5	Due to the absence of sequence, the chanting would be without sequence.
29.4.6	The Udgātṛ himself sings with the three (Vedic) metres. Thus he shows that the praise is inferior to himself.
29.4.7	The praise of the Nādeśa would be only of the Chandogas.
29.4.8	Having said that the Udgātṛ alone should sing with all (the Vedic metres), he then prescribes the places (of the Udgītha).
29.4.9	Having praised the Havirdhana with the head, they go back to the Prati-sthaniya. Having gone round the Dhishnyas on the right, they sit down at the Maitravaruna's Dhishnya. This shows that those who praise with the head, praise with the others.
29.4.10	The Ilan-dam Agniṣṭoma-sāman is to be performed. The verses beginning with "O Agni, may thy fame" are to be sung in the first three verses of ten syllables each.
29.4.11	Thus it becomes in the Trica.
29.4.12	The teachers say that the Anugānas are in the half verses.
29.4.13	Śāṇḍilya says that it is in the twelve verses.
29.4.14	There, the two verses beginning with "O Agni, Agni" and "That Agni" are to be recited in the reverse order.
29.4.15	Vargasayana says that the fourth verse is to be recited in accordance with the anugana.
29.4.16	Here, he speaks of the Nidhanavada, which becomes "Vrata", "Svara", and "Sakuna".
29.4.17	And the Bhaktas at the end of the Kalpa.
29.4.18	Some others recite them in different Samavesas.
30.1.1-4	Some say that the Triṃśa should be the Agniṣṭoma Sāman at the tenth day of the Cāturmāsya sacrifice. Others say that it should be the Trika Sarpārajna Sāman. The Rg and Sāman verses are mentioned in the Cāturmāsyas. The Cāturmāsyas are performed for the sake of the entire year. The Triṃśa Sāman is mentioned in the Caturmāsyas.
30.1.5	And because it is directly stated, the rule of the majority applies.
30.1.6	In the Brahmana-prescribed Stoma, the Kalpa section has the verses and Sama.
30.1.7	The thirty-one Sutiyas should be mentioned everywhere.
30.1.8	In the Kaundapayana Ayana, the Haviryajnikas.
30.1.9	And in the Taapashvita, the Daikopasadanas.
30.1.10	In the Dritivaatavata Ayana, two and one less than a month should be sung.
30.1.11	Gautama says that it is to be performed with three Vratas.
30.1.12	Dhananjaya says that it is with thirty-three Vratas. Both of them are right.
30.1.13	The Brāhmaṇa says that it is so.
30.1.14	If this is so, then on the eighth day of the bright fortnight, having initiated for the Pañcadaśa Diksā, they should perform the initiation.
30.1.15	This is said in the Sarpasaṭra.
30.1.16	The teachers say that the Upakrama should be of fifteen verses, and the Utkara of eighteen verses. For the sixteenth verse is a deviation from the regular course.
30.1.17	Just as the Upakramanikta is a deviation from Trivrt.
30.1.18	But there is no deviation from the regular order, because there is no mention of it.
30.1.19	The statement of the reason is not seen in the case of the sixteen-fold sacrifice, and the sixteen-fold sacrifices are not seen frequently.
30.1.20	The discussion on the order of the months.
30.1.21	Some say that one month is performed by the Prishthya.
30.1.22	Sandilya says that it is by the Prishthyas toma.
30.1.23	Shuchi-Vrishi says that it is done by the Abhiplava and Prishthya (sacrifices).
30.1.24	Sandilya-yana-Dhananjaya says that it is performed by the one-day Prishthya.
30.1.25	Jyotisṭoma is the name of the sacrifice, says Lāmakāyana.
30.1.26	The Rathantara and Bṛhat are the two Sāmans to be chanted in the reverse order.
30.1.27	The Kṣīrakalāmba says that the performance should be in accordance with the rules of the Ārsheya Kalpa.
30.2.1	The initiation ceremonies beginning with the Full Moon day are as prescribed by Kauṇḍapāyin.
30.2.2	Śāṇḍilīya says that after performing the Upasadant and Upvasatha rites, one should proceed to the Atiratra rite. This is how the practice is followed.
30.2.3	Those who perform the Agnihotra should offer thirty-one oblations.
30.2.4	Gautama says that it is only for one month.
30.2.5	But before the Sutyas, there should be the Upasatha rite and the Atiratra. Thus the practice is followed.
30.2.6	And there is no interruption in the Havyayajnas of the Sutyas.
30.2.7	Dhananjaya says that the Atiratra should not be performed because it is not heard of.
30.2.8	and he who is not at the end of the sacrifice, he does not perform here.
30.2.9	They should perform the Upasad rites at the end of their own sacrifice. They should buy the king for the Snanasiras from the eighteenth (day) onwards. Thus it becomes in succession to the Sutya rites.
30.2.10	The separation of the Diksaniyas and Upasads is improper, says Sandilyayana.
30.2.11	They buy Soma in the month of Magha. This shows that the initiation is to be done immediately after the Darsha-Purnamāsa sacrifices.
30.2.12	It should be done immediately after Sutyā.
30.2.13	Having taken the embers from the Agnidhra and having cooked the separate Homas in the Marjālīya, they should perform the Pitryajña.
30.2.14	Then they should give the Dakshina in the Pitryajna.
30.2.15	To the south of the Ahavaniya, in the Varuna-sprinkle-waters.
30.2.16	In that (place) they should do what is to be done to the south of the Ahāvaniya.
30.2.17	If the Upavasatha rite has been performed,
30.2.18	it is done according to the natural course.
30.2.19	If the Agnihotra is to be offered on the day of initiation, the Adhvaryu should offer it, the others should join him.
30.2.20	They should sprinkle the oblations as in the case of an Iṣṭi.
30.2.21	The Agnihotra-offering, the Viṣṇukrama-steps, and the Samitsti-sprinkling should not be performed.
30.2.22	Śāṇḍilāyana says that the Avabhrtha-rite is an accessory.
30.2.23	The Samits should be mentioned first.
30.2.24	Dhananjaya says that everything should be performed.
30.2.25	The month is to be observed by the New and Full Moon sacrifices. The former half of the month is to be performed by the New Moon sacrifice, and the latter half by the Full Moon sacrifice.
30.2.26	Gautama says that the Pitryajna should be performed once, because it is not to be performed every day.
30.2.27	Sandilya says that it should be performed once.
30.2.28	Dhananjaya says that it should take place every day.
30.3.1	The Brāhmaṇa says that one should perform the Saakamedha sacrifices for a month. Having performed the Grhamedhya sacrifice, one should then establish the remaining (sacrifices).
30.3.2	Thus they are to be performed thirty times.
30.3.3	In the original (text) they are to be practised fifteen times in two days. That is a month.
30.3.4	The Adhvaryus named Daśahotāra performed the Agnihotra-offering, the priests were to be present at the Agnihotra, they were to be surrounded by the later ones, and they were to utter the Vasat-call at the sacrifice.
30.3.5	They should eat from the Atasaruka vessels, which are like pots.
30.3.6	The Hotr has been described in brief by the Brahmana.
30.3.7	One should perform the Hotr rites for the other priests, starting from the Svadasana.
30.3.8	Similarly, for the Udgata, Prastotar, and Agnidhra.
30.3.9	Some say that there is a violation because of the occurrence in the scriptures.
30.3.10	If the one who is not the Hotri were to be the Udgata,
30.3.11	The householder is the householder, Subrahmanya is the householder. This shows that they are not compounded.
30.3.12	By this, the initiation etc. of Tapasci is stated.
30.3.13	The considerations of its performance.
30.3.14	Jyotis toma, Atiratra, Sodashi, and Harah should be performed daily, says Dhananjaya.
30.3.15	Four Jyotis toma, Abhijit, this is the five-day sacrifice, one should practice in six months.
30.3.16	The Mahāvrata is the Viṣuva.
30.3.17	Now these very ones, having turned around, are the six months of the northern solstice.
30.3.18	Viśvajit and Abhijit are the places.
30.3.19	This is the abode of Narayana.
30.3.20	This very one is the five-day sacrifice, which is the entire year, at the end of the months, in the places of Viśvajit and Abhijīt. One should perform it as long as one lives.
30.3.21	For the hymns are worthy of praise, and the devotion is for a hundred years.
30.3.22	The Abhijit is the morning star of Agni.
30.3.23	The Jyotishoma is the Rathantara-pṛṣṭha.
30.3.24	The Brihat-pṛṣtha is of Indra.
30.3.25	In the alternation, the Brihat and Rathantara should be in the sixth (verse). That is of Indra and Agni.
30.3.26	That is the rite of Indra and Agni
30.3.27	The Ubhayasāman is of Brahma and Prajapati.
30.3.28	The Vairūpa-pṛṣthya is of Vayu. The Vrata is of
30.3.29	The Visvajit is the back of Aditya's Viraj.
30.3.30	The Sakvari is the back of the waters.
30.3.31	The Revati is the back of cows.
30.3.32	The Vamadevya is the back of Prajapati.
30.3.33	The Svaraprstha is the back of all the gods.
30.3.34	The Mahadivakirti is the back of Surya.
30.3.35	The Mahavrata is the back of Mahendra.
30.4.1	The months of the Kṣullatapa, Mahātapa and Diksopasad are separate groups of four months each. The year is the aggregate of these.
30.4.2	The year is the aggregate.
30.4.3	The increase and stoppage of the months in the northern and southern solstices are fixed in the cow-solstice.
30.4.4	The northern solstice is considered.
30.4.5	The cow-solstices are four.
30.4.6	Or the three preceding ones are the cow-stices, and the fourth is the solstice.
30.4.7	The Kousurubinda is the Vayana.
30.4.8	Or by the Jyotishtoma.
30.4.9	By that, three are the northern ones.
30.4.10	Its Rathantara is the Prstha and the Brihat is the Vyatiasa.
30.4.11	The Ayana of Driti and Vata is the Kshirakalam, the Ambaryatharseyakalpasamnayan.
30.4.12	The Agnishtomas are the Trivrit Ukthyas. The others are the Pare.
30.4.13	Here, since it is not mentioned, there should be no Atiratras and Visuvat. This is the view of Sandilya.
30.4.14	The other view is that it is according to the Satra rule. This is the opinion of Dhananjaya.
30.4.15	There should be Atiratras on both sides.
30.4.16	In the middle, Visuvat, Brihat, Prishtha, Rathantara, Madhyandin, fifteen and seventeen.
30.4.17	It would be in one of the groups of the year.
30.4.18	Or in the last of the groups.
30.4.19	Or in separate years.
30.4.20	Their Visuvat should be according to the number of Stomas.
30.4.21	It should be with Rathantara as the Prastara, Brihat as the Brahma-saman and Trivrt as the Stoma.
30.4.22	Brihat as the Prastāra, Rathantara as the Madhyandina and the others as the Visuvat.
30.4.23	The Prasuta should be on the Yajaniya day, when the Parva days have passed beyond half a month.
30.4.24	In the other case, in the uneven ones.
30.4.25	The teachers say that the Sahasra-savya is performed with the Sahasra and Atiratra sacrifices, because it is said that the Sahasrasavya is performed.
30.4.26	Saucivirkṣi says that it is performed in between.
30.4.27	The Sahasra-mahāni is performed in between the Atiratra sacrifices.
30.4.28	The procedure of the Sahasra is as follows:
30.4.29	The Atiratra is the Trikdruka, the three nights, and the Catuṣṣaṣṭiśatam abhiplava nights. The Vrata is the Atiratra. The Vrata Atiratra.
31.1.1	They should be initiated on the southern bank of the Sarasvati at Vinashana for the Sarastvata.
31.1.2	Gautama says, "The Atiratra should be performed on the sixth day of the waning moon."
31.1.3	Thus, the new moon is used in its own place.
31.1.4	If the Prasuti (the day on which the Soma is to be pressed) falls on the seventh day, then one should consecrate himself on the seventh day and press the Soma on the Amāvāsyā day. This is the view of Dhānajaya. The two Sutyas are to be performed in succession.
31.1.5	The Amāvāsyya day is used as the original place.
31.1.6	Because the Amāvāśya day is the original place for the Pūrvapāksa.
31.1.7	In the evening before the night, they should perform the milking.
31.1.8	After the Atiratra has been completed, they should perform milking in the morning.
31.1.9	They should offer the Sannāyya oblation.
31.1.10	Having offered the Sannāyyā oblation, the Adhvaryu should throw the dice towards the Havaniya fire while standing facing east and in the position of the regular oblation.
31.1.11	This is stated in the Brāhmaṇa.
31.1.12	It is like a wheel.
31.1.13	Thus, the Patnīśālā and the Śāmitra should be there.
31.1.14	They should be arranged according to their respective places. If the ground is level, the portion should be equal.
31.1.15	If the ground is uneven, the arrangement should be in order.
31.1.16	They should remove the ashes of the Veda and the subsequent Veda, and also for Vishnu.
31.1.17	Having settled them, they should scatter them according to their respective abodes.
31.1.18	The sacrificial post should have a broad base, as it is said, "The sacrificial post has a broad base."
31.1.19	They should drag him forward, not lifting him up.
31.1.20	He should stand covered with dust, not dug in.
31.1.21	The digging of the pits called Uparava, which are below the Adhiṣavaṇa and Phalakas, is prohibited.
31.1.22	They should draw lines on them, but not dig them.
31.1.23	They should perform the Goṣṭoma sacrifice on the full moon day.
31.1.24	The teachers say that it should be on the day of sacrifice.
31.1.25	Having completed the Goṣṭoma sacrifice, he performs the Full-moon sacrifice.
31.1.26	The mention of the Full-moon and New-moon days is in the form of the entire (month).
31.1.27	But it should be on a festival day.
31.1.28	He performs it on the Full-moon day of those (days) and on the New-moon day of them, because it is directly mentioned.
31.1.29	The Sthāṇḍila sacrifice is the only one which is performed immediately after the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices.
31.1.30	The statement that the moon waxes and wanes is based on the fact that it is seen to be so.
31.1.31	Dhānajīya says that when the Goṣṭha sacrifice is over, they should perform the Pūrṇamāsah sacrifice on the same day.
31.1.32	Śāṇḍilya says that those who do not perform the sacrifice should stay there for the night.
31.2.1	This explains the life span.
31.2.2	There, Dhananjaya should milk the evening milking before the morning milking on the new moon day.
31.2.3	The cooked rice should be kept for a long time, says Śāṇḍilāyana.
31.2.4	One should perform either of the two.
31.2.5	Kundapayin has said that food is to be eaten at the Iṣṭyāyana.
31.2.6	The rites of the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa are also mentioned.
31.2.7	They are of the size of the moon.
31.2.8	If the river is flowing in one direction, they should perform the Apomitriya Iṣṭi on the Dṛṣadvatī river.
31.2.9	If the water is not flowing, they should perform it on the Dhananjaya river.
31.2.10	If there are a hundred cows and a bull, they should perform a sacrifice.
31.2.11	They should protect the cows where there is no danger from predators.
31.2.12	The bulls of those (cows) should be fed with ghee.
31.2.13	When a thousand cows have been obtained, having performed the Gamapatiraatra in the first half, they should be given and then they should be kept.
31.2.14	When all the enemies are conquered, then there is authority over them, because of being the subject matter.
31.2.15	There, the Vishvajit Atiratra.
31.2.16	When the householder dies, the wind.
31.2.17	From the end of the appearance of these two calamities, they would rise even in the other half.
31.2.18	They would not bathe in the Sarasvati river only once, because it becomes the place of worship of the gods.
31.2.19	If the Sarasvati river is not present, then the crossing should be done from the side.
31.2.20	When they reach the Prastravana near the Plaksha tree, then they rise.
31.2.21	Thus they would proceed in such a way that the former party would come to them.
31.2.22	Having reached that, they should proceed to the Prāyaniya Atiratra and then rise, says Śāṇḍilīya.
31.2.23	If they have to rise for some reason, they should proceed only to the Prāyṇīya Atiratra, says Dhānajīya.
31.2.24	Having reached Prāsaravana, a place of the sacred fig tree, before the Atiratra, there should be an Isti to Agni Kamaya. This is the opinion of Shandilya. After this, says Dhananjaya.
31.2.25	In this, they should give a mare, a woman, a cow, and the remaining sacrificial requisites to a suitable person.
31.2.26	Because all the owners do not have the right to accept in the Sattras.
31.2.27	The Avabhrtha has been described in the Brāhmaṇa.
31.2.28	This is the rite of pacification for the back.
31.3.1	The rites for the northern direction are explained by this.
31.3.2	In that, the Iṣṭi to Agni Kāma and the Sruvahoma to Apāṃnāptri should be performed.
31.3.3	Śāṇḍilī says that the Iṣṭī to Agni Kāma should be performed after the Atiratra.
31.3.4	Indra Kukṣī is performed at the Parvan.
31.3.5	Abhijit is performed at the Full Moon.
31.3.6	Gautama says that the two Agniṣṭoma sacrifices in the eastern direction should be of three and five stoma, with Rāthantara and Bṛhat chants. The Ukthya sacrifice in the eastern direction is of fifteen stoma, with Rathantara and Bṛhats. The Ukthyas in the western direction are of fifteen stoma.
31.3.7	One should not move between the two directions.
31.3.8	But in all cases, the three and five stomas should be alternated.
31.3.9	If the two directions are not followed, one should begin the next direction with the one that has not been followed.
31.3.10	This is said to be the rule for the Trikṣatra.
31.3.11	The vows of the Dārsha-Paurnamasa are mentioned.
31.3.12	One should stand during the day and sleep at night.
31.3.13	One should eat the remnants of the oblation.
31.3.14	One should be a non-meat eater.
31.3.15	One should not eat salt.
31.3.16	One should avoid women.
31.3.17	One should live according to one's natural inclination, without the fire.
31.3.18	A Brāhmaṇa should protect the cow of a Brāhmaṇa or a preceptor for a year.
31.3.19	The people of the Nītha clan, whose one member is Sarasvatī, should offer Agnihotra for a year. The service of one Agnihotra is done by that.
31.3.20	One who offers Agnihotra should offer it before the one who has not offered Agnihotra.
31.3.21	After a year, there is a place called Parīṇa in Kurukṣetra. Having established the fires there, one should perform the Anvarambhaṇīya Iṣṭi at the proper time and then proceed. This is said by Śāṇḍilīya.
31.3.22	One should perform sacrifices with the Darśa and Pūrṇamāsa rites. This is said in Dhānajaya.
31.3.23	If one is a person who has established the fire, one should offer oblations in the evening and morning and then proceed.
31.3.24	Having reached the confluence of Sarasvati and Drishadvati, one should commence the sacrifice with an eight-pot offering to Agni.
31.3.25	Here, the throwing of the dice is as in the Sarasvati rites.
31.3.26	But one should not proceed in stages.
31.3.27	One may perform many sacrifices in a single day.
31.3.28	One should go along the southern bank of the Drishadvati.
31.3.29	Having reached the sacred place of her, one should perform the prescribed rites and then cross the Yamuna river to take away the three trees.
31.3.30	Dhananjaya says that the Yamuna riverbank is far from wherever one may be.
31.3.31	Having performed the prescribed rites there, one should cross the Yamuna in the morning, singing the Sama Veda.
31.3.32	Or without singing.
31.3.33	Śāṇḍilya thinks that this is the course of action for one who is about to renounce the world.
31.3.34	One then disappears from the sight of humans and ascends to heaven.
31.3.35	One turns away from evil and becomes better.
31.3.36	Or one does not return to the village again.
31.3.37	Or one disappears under water.
31.3.38	Or one is like one who is free from dust.
31.4.1	One should offer oblations every day for a year.
31.4.2	The teachers say that the sixth day is the day of Caitrī.
31.4.3	Śāṇḍilyāyana says that the fifth day is the day.
31.4.4	Having offered the morning oblation, having eaten the food offered at the end of the vow, having shaved the hair and beard, having put on a new garment, having surrounded the fires, having led the Praṇītā oblations, having taken the staff in hand, having tied the girdle, having anointed the limbs with fresh butter, having sat down behind the Garhapatya fire, the sacrificer himself should spread the skin of a black antelope silently.
31.4.5	Having gone round the Ahavaniya from the west and having crossed it from the south, one should do this.
31.4.6	Of it, three Iṣṭis are in the morning, one is separate, another is at midday, and the last is in the evening.
31.4.7	In them, the oblations mentioned separately in the Brāhmaṇa are offered in succession.
31.4.8	If there is only one, all of them should be there.
31.4.9	In that, the singing of Sāman is as in the previous one.
31.4.10	Having performed the Avabhṛtha rite, one should perform the Soma sacrifice with the Iṣṭi rite which is performed before the Avabhṛta rite.
31.4.11	As many oblations as there are before the Avabhृtha rite, so many animals are to be offered.
31.4.12	The serpent sacrifice, the cow sacrifice, and the Stoma-stha-vikṛta are mentioned.
31.4.13	It is said that Saṇḍa and Kuṣaṇḍa are Abhigara and Apagara.
31.4.14	But what is prescribed in the Veda is done according to the rules of the Arsha-kalpa. There is no inference there.
31.4.15	Abhigar and Apagar are to be performed on the two days next to the full moon day.
31.4.16	The full moon day is the source of the three years.
31.4.17	For those who desire, the initiation is done according to their wish.
31.4.18	Shandila says that there are sixty.
31.4.19	Dhananjaya says that one should omit the first and last years.
31.4.20	The Abhiplva Stoma is for the purpose of ascending the regions of the Stoma.
31.4.21	In the new moon of the Sahasra-Samvatsara year, in the Sahasra Samvatsara year.

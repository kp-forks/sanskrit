8.3.9	It is known that the two grains, Vrīhi and Yava, are the milk of animals. Therefore, they offer this.
8.4.1	When a son is born, one brings the kindling wood of the Ashvattha tree with a Shami seed, either ten or twelve inches long.

8.21.10	One gives ten cows, ten bulls, ten garments, and ten copper vessels.
8.21.11	Those who perform rites for the dead are nourished by the vital airs Prāṇa and Apāna.
8.21.12	Therefore, one should practice austerity for a year, or for six months, according to some.
8.21.13	If one has performed a sacrifice for one's father, brother, or preceptor, one is anointed.
8.21.14	If one has done this and then returns, one should generate the fires and perform the Ayusya sacrifices, and then perform unlimited sacrifices.

This is the rite for the dead.
8.23.1-4	Śākalya says that a woman whose husband is dead and who has no fire should not offer sacrifices. Māruka says that if she is examined and found to be virtuous, the Adhvaryu should tell her to serve the sacrificial fire. If she is examined and is found to be virtuous then the Ācārya Citrasena Vātsyāyana says that the dead wife should be examined.
8.23.5	She who is employed in the fallen state, who has that vow, who has that suffering, who has that conduct, who has one braid smeared with dirt, who has pure clothes,

8.23.9	One should offer oblations with ghee.
8.23.10	These two are born together as a couple. They establish the fires together and generate offspring together.
8.23.11	The former belongs to the sacrificer, the latter to his wife.
8.23.12	If the wife of a man who is absent or incapable of performing the sacrifice observes the vow, she becomes entitled to half the share.
8.23.13	Women are entitled to half the shares at a sacrifice, the wife of the sacrificer is entitled to half the sacrifice.
8.23.14	What is offered in the Ahavaniya is the sacrifice of the sacrificer, what is offered in the Garhapatya is the sacrifice offered by the wife.
8.23.15	"May the wife and husband go together to the good deeds."
8.23.16	Because of the perception of the connection between the two, and because of the modification of the woman in the context of the pair, the Veda shows it in the same way in the Mantras, Brahmanas, and Kalpas.
8.23.17	There, some cremate their dead wives with fire from the sacrificial wood, others with fire from the churning stick, and still others with all the fires. But that is not proper.
8.23.18	One who cremates his wife with the Agnihotra fire in any way becomes a woman, and his wife becomes a man.
8.23.19	Having approached the Garhapatya fire, one should place the pot on it.

8.23.21	"He should offer oblations with the mantra, "O Agni, the form that is dear to you, the form that shines from the mouth of the fire, may it ascend into this vessel. To that, salutations! Svāhā!", and then cremate (the body) according to the prescribed method.
8.23.22	If the sacrificer dies before the rite, then having performed the rites in five fires in the order of their origination, the Avashthya (fire) should be given to the wife.
8.23.23	If there is no Avashthya, then the Garhapatya should be divided into five parts and one part should be given.
8.23.24	A woman is not a Nara (man), because women are the offspring.
8.23.25	Having placed that Agni, he should say, "May this Agni grant us protection." They should place the ornaments.
8.23.26	When they are heated, one should offer with the verse, "We invoke Vaisvānara, the universal creator, the universal-born, the universal-begotten, the Agni of the assembly and dwelling, hidden in many ways, the Agni of women, the morning Agni, Svāhā." One offers thus.
8.23.27	When it is self-followed, everything comes.
8.23.28	Ojas, you are, Sahas, you are, Bala, you are, Bhaja, you are. Again, at the time of Agni, they should heat their own ornaments in the fire of the sacrificial post.
8.23.29	If someone were to approach him, having approached that Agni, he should attend to him.
8.23.30	For the deceased, there is a rice-gruel offering to Yama, or to Soma, or to Nirriti.
8.24.1	Now, we shall explain the rite of Sapindīkaraṇa (the uniting of the departed with the living) on the thirteenth day, in the Tripakṣa (the three fortnights), in the Vṛddhi (the increasing) year, or in the Śrāddha (rite).
8.24.2	After the fire, he places four water-vessels on the even darbha grass.
8.24.3	Among them, one is for the departed, and three are for the ancestors.
8.24.4	He pours the Preta vessel into the Pitṛ vessels with the two verses, "Those who are equal, of equal mind."
8.24.5	Thus the offering to the Pitṛs in the form of balls has been explained.
8.25.1	Now we shall explain the method of renunciation.
8.25.2	The householder, having begotten a son, and having seen his son or his sons, and having arranged for their livelihood, and having entrusted his family to a virtuous son, then he should perform the rites of fire.
8.25.3	One should offer an oblation of eight potfuls to Agni Pathikrita and twelve potfuls to Agni Vaishvānara.
8.25.4	The rite of offering has been explained. The offering has been accomplished.
8.25.5	At the time of giving the Dakṣiṇā, he should give away all his possessions.
8.25.6	Having invited his relatives, he should consign the fires into himself. The fire is indeed a witness to one's good and bad deeds. This is the meaning.
8.25.7	"He should heat himself in the Āhavanīya, Gārhapatya, and Dakṣiṇīya fires, saying, "This is your natural abode."
8.25.8	All the sacrificial vessels, having made them in the shape of a man inside the altar, should be lit with three kinds of fire.
8.25.9	Today, let us speak with the three Vedas.
8.25.10	When he says, "The Agni who is ours, I take him in myself," he takes a handful of ashes from the Āhavaniya, Gārhapatya and Dakṣiṇāgni. Just as this handful of ashes is brought from the directions, it goes to the directions.
8.25.11	Then he cuts off the end and goes without looking back.
8.25.12	What he eats in the evening is his evening sacrifice, what he eats in the morning is his morning sacrifice, what he does at the New Moon is the New Moon, what he does on the Full Moon is the Full Moon.
8.25.13	What he eats on the ninth day, that is his Agnayan. What he shaves his head and beard in spring, that is his Agnistoma.
8.25.14	This is renunciation. He goes to the forest, subsisting on roots and fruits, or on alms alone.
8.25.15	Above this, he enters the fire, or goes to the path of heroes, or becomes a non-eater, or attains the stage of the aged.
8.25.16	He does not return again. If he returns, he becomes a hero-killer.
8.26.1	Now we shall explain the wandering of the sacred places.
8.26.2	The first is between the Āhavaniya and the Utkara, the second between the Cātvāla and the Utkāra, the third between the Cātwāla and the Āhavani ya, the fourth between the Sruci and the Paridhi, the fifth at the southern Paridhi.
8.26.3	The first is for Agni, the second for Varuna, the third for Vayu, the fourth for Asvins, the fifth for Visnu.
8.26.4	We shall now explain the order of these.
8.26.5	Between the Āhavanīya and the Utkara, there is the arrangement of the vessels, wives, maidens, water, clarified butter, oblations, and fuel.
8.26.6	Between the Cātvāla and the Utkāra, there is the entry of the priests and the sacrificer, and the approach to the assembly.
8.26.7	Between the Cātvāla and the Āhavanīya is the passing of the animal, the passing of the Jaghanī, and the Anvāhāram of the animal and the sacrificial post.
8.26.8	Between the Āhavanīyī and the ladles is the passing of both the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer to the right, and the return. This has been explained in detail.
8.26.9	The southern boundary line is the place of invocation, sending forth, svāhā, vaṣaṭ, salutation, oblation, and the world.
8.26.10	These are the five sacred places.
8.26.11	The five years that are established in the sacred places are known as the "row".
8.26.12	Those who have resorted to non-sacred places, the priests, live for a short span of life. Those who have resorted (to sacred places) live for the full span of life.
8.26.13	One who knows this and acts accordingly, all his desires are fulfilled.
8.26.14	If one acts otherwise, half of his sacrifice is bound by Varuna's noose. His sacrifice does not go to the gods. His sacrifice does go to the gods.

10.3.2.3	Two of those is known as an Aratni, and a Prakrama is equal to an Aratni. Two Pradeshas is a Citini.
10.3.2.4	The four steps should be reduced by half an angula.
10.3.2.5	There are eleven sacrificial posts, four more than four, in the three sacrificial grounds.
10.3.2.6	If the sacrificial ground is separate from the fire, then the fire is arranged separately.
10.3.2.7	The human body is said to be of twenty fingers, a hundred, or five cubits, or ten steps, according to the method of deficiency and excess. The measure is different for each body.
10.3.2.8	Sixty-eight is said to be a yuga, and it is said to be eighteen. The axle, the chariot, and the yoke are equal to the system, and the two wheels are attached.
10.3.2.9	Now listen to the method of construction of the square and circular maṇḍalas, which is stated by those who know it.
10.3.2.10	The length of the maṇḍala is equal to the diameter of the circle, and the hanging string is four times the length of the maṇaḍala. The maṇḍala becomes from the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of three parts, the longer side being the hypotenuse.
10.3.2.11	A man should make a man, and with that eye, it would become two men. With that eye again, it would be four.
10.3.2.12	A two-man-long object should be made, the waist and arms should be twice that. The three-man-long one should have three supports, and then in the square, there are eight men.
10.3.2.13a	The diameter is five parts, and the diameter is three times that.
10.3.2.13c	That is the projection of the circle, not exceeding the circumference.
10.3.2.14a	Divide the diameter into ten parts and remove three parts.
10.3.2.14c	That will be a square, and that is the width of the circle.
10.3.2.15a	Divide the square into nine parts, and divide the corners into three parts each.
10.3.2.15c	If he cuts off the top of a wall, he should be made to pay the value of the wall.
10.3.2.16	A man of four cubits is said to be half a cubit in the making of sand.
10.3.2.17	Then he should make the instruments of it, three, four, five, three times, turning around. The rule for collecting the auspicious things in the collection places, which was stated by the ancient sages, is always stated.
10.3.2.18	By writing, mental collection, and alternating, with the abundance of measurements, all should be known by the measurements of length and width.
10.3.2.19	The four-cornered ones are known as the two-cornered ones, which are the five-limbed ones, or those shown by the ancient sages in the past.
10.3.2.20a	And this is the rule of demarcation, equal to the pair there.
10.3.2.20c	The five-limbed one is the rope of that length with which we measure everything.
10.3.2.20e	Excepting the bones, I shall describe their characteristics.
10.3.2.21	This is the measure, half of which is the mark of the time. Then in the fourth (part) there is the absence of a mark. Then the remaining half is the same as the extension. Then one should go four Kustas from here.
10.3.2.22	Then one should place the eastern direction equal to the length, and then dig the middle rope.
10.3.2.23	Then, having released it, he should dig a hole in the middle, facing south, without any mark, half the width of the hole, and then in the west and north, in the middle. This is for the Vasuvedi.
10.3.2.24	Now, this measurement should be done for the rope to be pulled out in the case of the Shrooniya.
10.3.2.25	He should draw lines on the shoulders and hips, and should drive stakes in the directions. He should draw lines around them.
10.3.2.26	If the stakes are not of wood, he should draw lines on both of them.
10.3.2.27	The eastern part is divided into three parts, and the western part is occupied by the Siddha and the Upa-siddha. The Utkara and Dakshina Agni are located there.
10.3.2.28	Now another drawing is done in the middle with a line of nine inches in the directions.
10.3.3.1a	The difference is known as half the measure minus sixty.
10.3.3.1c	The difference and the measure should be according to the measure.
10.3.3.2	The other should be half the measure, in the twenty-fourth and sixth of the noose. The characteristic is made without a mark, with the eye, and the remaining is measured horizontally. The hips are half the noose.
10.3.3.3	The Agnihotra is taught here.
10.3.3.4a	That is the measure of Agni's eye.
10.3.3.4c	One should know that as the horse sacrifice, or in the twenty-one-fold (sacrifice).
10.3.3.5a	When a man is horizontal and divided into ten parts,
10.3.3.5c	The area of his ear should be known as the eleventh.
10.3.3.6a	The two arms are the measure of the man's eye, when he is horizontal.
10.3.3.6c	The height of the altar should be increased by one foot for every hundred feet of the height of the building.
10.3.3.6	Thus it is said.
10.3.4.1a	If the height of the supporting pillar is sixteen feet,
10.3.4.1c	This is the procedure in the measurement of the altar.
10.3.4.2a	The third part of the procedure is for the Sauma sacrifice, and the fourth part is for the Sarparajni sacrifice.
10.3.4.2c	The remaining three parts are for the Uttara Veda.
10.3.4.3a	Or it may be fourteen inches, and the Sāumiki (line) is drawn by that.
10.3.4.3c	Or one may draw it with twelve hundred (lines).
10.3.4.4a	The forest is with six or nine or seven (lines).
10.3.4.4c	Or with nine (lines) the outer circle is drawn. The instrument should not be drawn in half.
10.3.4.5a	In the four (lines) one should draw the Savitri and others. The method is as follows:
10.3.4.5c	Having dug a hole at the knees of the red (cloth), one should fill it with water.
10.3.4.6	Then the four-sided maṇḍala is of two kinds, characterized by the Garhapatya and the size of the exercise. One should draw the maṇḍala with four arms and half the size of a man.
10.3.4.7	The Vyāyāma is the third, ending with the fourth, extending seven parts, built first and then later, alternating. That is the twenty-first.
10.3.4.8-9	The third part of the man is the square, which is six parts wide. The Pratika is of the same size. The middle is of the same width as the Pratika. The remaining two corners are equal to the Pratika, and are made of the same width. The Visakha is of the same height as the Pratika, but is made of six parts. The height of the triangle is two and a half parts.
10.3.4.10	The four-cornered enclosure is called Pratika, and the half of it is called Pratika.
10.3.4.11	The four instruments are made in the mandala, each divided into parts.
10.3.4.12	In the middle of it, there are four bricks. In the two eastern and western ones, there are two each. Again, there is a pair of half-bricks. Again, there comes a circle. In the two half-bricks, it is complete. That is the twenty-one.
10.3.4.13	One should place the bricks in reverse order, facing north, or one may place them in reverse order, alternating with the next one.
10.3.4.14	The height of a half-verse is said to be half the height of a verse, and the measures of the Gāyatrī are known to be half the size of a verse.
10.3.4.15a	Having made a rope four times the length of a man, and having made it even,
10.3.4.15c	Those who know the five parts know it to be controlled by the knowledge of the shares.
10.3.4.16a	The control from the middle of the noose is said to be the measure of the Gāyatra.
10.3.4.16c	The square is measured by the half-man and the Saratna.
10.3.4.16e	By the increase of the wings and tail, and by the Gayatra and others.
10.3.4.17a	The bricks are reduced by drying and cooking, from the thirty-two measures.

11.2.2	In the first part of the root, it is not desired by the father, in the second by the mother, in the third by the wealth, and in the fourth by the sorrow of the family or by the self. One becomes a recipient of merit.

11.3.1	Now, the Yama-shanti (pacification of Yama):

11.3.13	If one cannot find those, one should enter the fire of the Veda covered with woolen cloth, skin, and grass. That is his favor.
11.4.1	Now we shall explain the procedure of Ashlesha.
11.4.2	In the first quarter, the mother dies; in the fourth quarter, the father dies.
11.4.3	Then, having taken the hundred medicinal herbs prescribed in the root ritual, placing them in a copper vessel or a vessel made of bell metal, and covering them with rice, establishing a snake the size of a gold coin facing downwards on top of it, performing ablution with the five products of a cow, wrapping it with a pair of garments, with a sacred thread, with fragrant flowers of five colors, with incense and lamps, with various offerings of food and drink, with betel leaves and other fruits, and with various kinds of fruits.

11.7.1.1	Now, we shall explain the rules and regulations of Rudra Japa.
11.7.1.2	In a clean place north of the village or in front of it, on the banks of a river, in a sacred pond, or in a lake, having removed impurities, one should perform three Pranayama exercises.
11.7.1.3	One should perform the Rudra bath.
11.7.1.4	"Salutations to Rudra. Having bathed, he should rub himself with the ten verses beginning with 'Asankhyata'. Having emerged, he should put on clothes, perform Ācamana, and place Rudra. The verse 'Ya te Rudra' on the head, 'Ye asmin mahati arnave' on the head. 'Asankhyatā' on the forehead. 'Salutations to Nīlakaṇṭha' on the eyes. 'Salutations, O Śruta and Śruta Sena' on the ears. 'Having lowered the bow' on the mouth. 'Salutations unto Nīlagrīva' on the throat. 'Salutations for the weapons, the unvanquished' on the arms. 'Salutations of the mountains' on the heart. 'Hiranyagarbha' on the navel. 'Salutations towards the Gaṇas' on the back. 'Salutations toward the protector of the earth' on the hips. 'These Rudras are yours' on the secret parts. 'Do not let the great one' on the thighs. 'Those who protect the path on the path' on the feet. 'Adhyavocat' on the armor. 'Salutations on the shield' on the sub-armor. 'Release the bow' on Astra."
11.7.1.5	Those who are so many - this is the binding of the directions.
11.7.1.6	"Oṃ, salutations to the Blessed Lord Rudra."
11.7.1.6a	Having placed Oṃ on the head, and Na on the nose,
11.7.1.6c	And Mo on the forehead, and Bha in the middle of the mouth,
11.7.1.6a	And Ga on the throat, and Va on the heart,
11.7.1.6c	And Te on the right hand, and Ru on the left hand,
11.7.1.6e	The letter "dra" is in the navel, and the letter "ya" is in the feet.
11.7.1.7	Indra, the protector, to Indra, the lord of the eastern direction, salutations. You, O Agni, to Agni, the lord of Agni, salutations. The auspicious path, to Yama, the lord of Dakshina, salutations. He who does not offer sacrifices, to Nirriti, the lord of Na-ir-rit-ti, salutations. I go to you, to Varuna, the lord of Varuna, salutations. Come to us with your messengers, to Vayu, the lord of Vayu, salutations. O Soma, with your resolutions, to Kubera, the lord of Kubera, salutations. That lord, to Ishana, the lord of Ishana, salutations. These powers to Rudra, to Brahma, the lord of Brahma, salutations. May the earth be auspicious, to Ananta, the lord of Ananta, salutations. This is the direction-box.
11.7.1.8	In the same way, having made the self into Rudra, one is freed from sins that have entered the skin and bones.
11.7.1.9	By this method, there are no disturbances caused by Yakshas, Rakshasas, Bhutas, Pretas, Pisachas, Yama, messengers, Shakinis, thieves, etc., in a village, at a woman's menstrual flow, at a funeral ceremony, or in the presence of an animal.
11.7.1.10	All of them see him blazing.
11.7.1.11	One should meditate on oneself in the form of Rudra.
11.7.1.12	Three-eyed, five-faced, ten-armed, gentle, adorned with all ornaments, blue-throated, marked with the moon, resembling pure crystal, wearing a serpent as a sacred thread, wearing a tiger skin as an upper garment, holding a water pot and a rosary, granting fearlessness, holding a trident, holding a Pināka bow, mounted on a bull's shoulder, bearing half of Uma's body, blazing, with tawny matted hair, adorned with a matted hair crown, illuminating the crest, bathed in nectar, delighted, saluted by gods and demons, endowed with the directional deities, always eternal, auspicious, firm, imperishable, unchanging, all-pervading, stainless, the Lord, Rudra, of universal form. Having meditated thus, the brahmin should then begin the recitation.
11.7.1.13	Having placed himself in a well-concealed place, on a cow-hide or on a smeared spot, having imagined the shape of the linga and lotus, having sprinkled it with the mantra "May no great one harm us," he should place it and worship it with "Salutations to Shambhu."
11.7.1.14	The invocation of Rudra is "Sadyo Vamaghoratattpuriseshan". The sage of this is Sadyojata, the deity is Brahma, the metre is Tristubh, the vehicle is a swan, the western face, the earth principle, the form of Brahma. The application is in the invocation of the western face. "I invoke the western face of Sadyojata." The sage of "A vahayanami Vamamadya Savitar" is Vamadeva, the deity is Vishnu, the metre is Trishtup, the vehicle is Garuda, the northern face, the water principle, the form is Vishnu. The application is for the invocation of the northern face. "I invite the northern face of today's Savitar." The sage of the "Aghorebhya" is Aghore, the deity is Rudra, the metre is Brihat, the vehicle is an elephant, the southern face, the fire principle, the form Rudra. The application is to invoke the southern face. "I offer salutations to the southern face of Aghore." The sage of Tatpurusha is Tatpurusha, the deity is Surya, the metre is Gayatri, the vehicle is horse, the eastern face, the wind principle, the form Surya. The application is the invocation of the eastern face. "I pay homage to the eastern face of Tatpurusha." The sage of Isha is Isha, the deity is sound, the metre is Brhati, the vehicle is tortoise, the upward face, the space principle, the white form. The application is invocation of the upward face. "I bow to the upward face of Isha." One should recite the Rudra Gayatri eight times, beginning with "May you be brought to me".
11.7.1.15	Meditate on Rudra.
11.7.1.16	Meditating on the blue-throated great god, dwelling on Kailasa with Uma, the three-eyed lord, one attains success.
11.7.1.17	Then one should begin the recitation with the eight chapters starting with "Salutations to you, O Rudra, the angry one."
11.7.1.18	In the first section there are three Gāyatrī verses, three Tristubh verses, three Paṅkti verses, seven Anushtubh verses, and in the last section there are one Brihatī verse, two Tristubh verses and twelve Anushtubh, two Jagatī verses.
11.7.1.19	The remaining verses of the Rudras are of various metres, with Rudra as the deity and Ghora as the sage.
11.7.1.20	In the Shatarudriya Samhita, the recitation is dedicated for the purpose of destroying all sins.
11.7.1.21	The eight sections begin with "Salutations to you, O Rudra, the one with wrathful energy..."
11.7.1.22	"The Rudras are innumerable." Having meditated on the installation according to the signs, one should meditate on "Salutations to the Rudras who are in heaven" on the right shoulder, "Salutations to those who are in the atmosphere" on the left shoulder, and "Salutations to them who are on the earth" on the knees.
11.7.1.23	Having recited "To the non-terrible ones," one should dismiss them with "Who are on the path."
11.7.1.24	Having recited the Aparatiraha mantra, one should return home.
11.7.1.25	One should sprinkle oneself with that water.
11.7.1.26	This is the procedure for reciting the Ajapā mantra: "Two-footed and four-footed, sentient."
11.7.2.1	I will now explain the procedure for the occasional Ajapā mantra.
11.7.2.2	Having bathed according to the previously mentioned procedure, performed the Nyasa, taken the conch water, and placed it in a vessel according to one's means, one should sprinkle the water with Durbha grass and flowers, unbroken rice, facing the northeast direction.
11.7.2.3	If one recites with the intention of someone, then it is like this. One should recite once, twice, thrice, seven times, if for the sake of health, eight times. If one is in one place, one should recite thrice. If it is for a regular or occasional purpose, one should recite an unlimited number of times.
11.7.2.4	If Rudra were to afflict the creatures in the northeastern direction, one should recite the Shatarudriya while walking.
11.7.2.5	One who recites this mantra for one day will be freed from diseases and sins.
11.7.2.6	One who recites this for three days will be freed from sins like Brahmahatya and from leprosy and other diseases.
11.7.2.7	According to this method, one should not recite this in a village, in the presence of a menstruating woman, at a funeral ceremony, in the presence or a cow, or during the night, one should not be celibate, one should not see outcasts, one should not look at menstruating women, and one should not engage in physical exercise.
11.7.2.8	When the rites are completed, one should recite the mantra "Oṃ namaḥ śrīghorāyai" and then dismiss them with "Oṃ yā pṛthivī".
11.7.2.9	One should sprinkle the officiating priest with that water.
11.7.2.10	Reciting "Apratiratha" one should return to the house.
11.7.2.11	If a brahmin recites this mantra, he will attain all his desires.
11.7.2.12	If the rites are performed without the prescribed procedure, it will be contrary to the interests of the brahmin officiating priest.
11.7.3.1	One who is pure, controlled, and has received blessings, having assigned the deity of the sage's verse, should recite Rudra after performing the deposition.
11.7.3.2	The sage is Aghoreśvara, the deity is Rudra, the metre is Brihatī, the application is in all rites. The heart is from the end of the Anuvāka beginning with "O Rudra, I make the animal your victim." The head is from the end beginning with "Viṣṇu wandered." The tuft is from the end "Brahmā, the father of Brahmā." The armour is from the end, "The Adityas, the new." The two six-verse hymns are the eyes. The weapon is from the end. The weapon is the Shatarudriya.
11.7.3.3	Thus, the invocation and dismissal are completed.
11.7.3.4	Having bowed down, one should offer the Japa.
11.7.3.5	With Palasha wood, ghee-soaked sesame offerings, and the three mantras "Om namaḥ śambhave", one should offer six or twelve oblations.
11.7.3.6	One who is devoted to bathing, offering libations, Japa, Homa, and worship, should recite it for a year.
11.7.3.6a	He obtains the ten fruits and becomes extremely pure, even if he is a killer of Brahmins.
11.7.3.6c	One who drinks liquor, steals gold, kills cows, or is the husband of a cow-woman,
11.7.3.6e	Is freed from all sins and goes to Rudra's world.
11.7.3.7	What is given by one who recites Rudra here becomes inexhaustible.
11.8.1.1	Now we shall explain the chapter on the best.
11.8.1.2	This is the Brahmanical text: "He chooses one, two, three, not four, not five, lest he should choose too much."
11.8.1.3	He chooses one, he chooses two, he chooses three, not four; he does not choose five, lest he choose too much.
11.8.1.4	Some here say that the choice of one is the only one that is Brahmanical and common to all castes. Why? Because the people are of Manu.
11.8.1.5	He should not choose the Arsha (graha) for the gods or men, but only for the Rsis.
11.8.1.6	He who chooses the Pararsha (graha) goes beyond the blessings of the sacrifice. The text is cut off. He who chooses the Parapravaras (grahas) is cut off from the plants, animals and ancestors.
11.8.1.7	This is said of the other classes of people, except the Brahmanas and Kshatriyas.
11.8.1.8	The Adhvaryu chooses the priests from this side only, as before. The Hotri from both sides, as before, and as invited.

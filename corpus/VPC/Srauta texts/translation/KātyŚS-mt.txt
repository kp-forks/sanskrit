1.2.22	Expiation is at that time.
1.2.23	The extent of the Veda is seen.

1.3.43	The mounds are at the beginning and end of the Iṣṭi.
1.4.1	When the injunction is not followed, there is no commencement, because it is accomplished by that.
1.4.2	In the case of a definite injunction, the substitute would be in general.
1.4.3	The restriction is due to commencement.

1.6.5	But in the case of the loss of a quality, because of the remaining state.
1.6.6	The words "deity", "fire", and "action" are not used, because they are for the sake of others.

1.7.4	In their difference, there is difference.
1.7.5	In contradiction, place and time.
1.7.6	Not because of the complete injunction.
1.7.7	In the group of days, the mention of all is like the nature of the Suparna.
1.7.8	Because of the non-insistence of the ritual time and action every day,
1.7.9	In the case of a single substance, the mantra is recited only once because the action has been performed.
1.7.10	But in the case of seizing the ladle, sprinkling, covering, and taking the clarified butter, it is not so.

1.7.12	And in the best portion.
1.7.13	But in sleep, crossing a river, rain, seeing impurity, and departure, it is done only once because of the oneness of time and substance.

1.8.6	It would be useful at a later time.
1.8.7	In the case of Dharma-matters, there is no incompatibility in the two being taken together.

1.8.20	The option of numbers is so called because of the connection with giving.
1.8.21	The combination of the Uvādhyas, Avāsādhīs, and Udhnis is so called because they belong to the substance and its modifications.
1.8.22	And in the qualities of injunction, by the two, the established and the binding.

7.4.2	He raises it, saying, "Rise up."
7.4.3	He places it on the right side.
7.4.4	Here is the making of the fist and the silence.
7.4.5	In this way, the Pratiprasthātṛ places the Patnī silently, simultaneously with the Mekhalā.
7.4.6	Or with the yoke.
7.4.7	Or a net on the head, in three layers.
7.4.8	The sacrificial post of the sacrificial tree is long and thick.
7.4.9	If one scratches with a stick, it becomes a girdle.
7.4.10	If it is a black antelope skin, it should be up to the staff.
7.4.11	Another initiated person says three times loudly, "This is a Brahmin."
7.4.12	Only "Brahmin" is heard for Vaishyas and Rajanyas.
7.4.13	He stops speaking after sunset.
7.4.14	When the sun has set, he says three times, "O wife, let loose speech."
7.4.15	Having circumambulated the fire, he says, "Let us perform the vow." Having said this three times, he says once, "Agni is Brahman."
7.4.16	Or, "Earth, Heaven, Space."
7.4.17	From here onwards, until the release of the fist, when the sun has not yet set or risen, he says three times, "Let the initiated one speak. Let the wife speak."
7.4.18	The release is as described.

7.4.30	In the last part of the night, the evening milking.

9.9.12	The Veda is without end.
9.9.13	One performs with the offerings to two deities.
9.9.14	One recites the Vayu and Indra-Vayu hymns.
9.9.15	The Pratiprasthātṛ takes up the Āditya vessel from the Dronakalaśa with the formula, "Thou art taken with a support." Having taken it twice, he offers the offerings to two gods in the eastern half.
9.9.16	Even after the Vasat-utterance.
9.9.17	The instructions are heard and re-heard because of equality.
9.9.18	because of non-transgression.
9.9.19	It would be because of non-contradiction.
9.9.20	He pours the remaining into the ladle placed on the sun, saying, "For the sun."
9.9.21	Having poured together, he covers it with that, saying, "To Vishnu, the all-pervading."
9.9.22	He recites while being carried.
9.9.23	He carries the ladles in nine, placing them to the north of the northern altar.

9.10.2	The Adhvayu with Sukra, the Pratiprasthātr with Manthin.
9.10.3	Taking the two pieces of the sacrificial post, one sprinkled and one not sprinkled,
9.10.4	he sprinkles the covering with the sprinkled ones.
9.10.5	He wipes with the unsprinkled ones. The Adhvaryu says, "The Shaṇḍa is wiped," and the Pratiprasthatṛ says, "The Marka is wiped."
9.10.6	The gods have come forth, each according to his own form.
9.10.7	Having placed the yoke-halter on the northern end of the northern altar, the Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthātṛ place it on the northern and southern sides of the northern altar respectively, saying, "Not to be deprived."
9.10.8	The Adhvaryu goes to the southern side of the sacrificial post, saying, "May there be good heroes."
9.10.9	The Pratiprasthātr goes to the northern side, saying, "Good progeny."
9.10.10	The Adhvaryu and the Pratiprasthātṛ place the two wooden pins on the north of the sacrificial post, saying, "May we be united."
9.10.11	If they are unable to do so, they place them on the east.
9.10.12	The Adhvaryu says, "The rejected one is the Śaṇḍa," and the Prati-prasthātṛ says, "The discarded one is the Marka."
9.10.13	The Adh-varyu and the Pratīprasthātṛ throw the sprinkled ones into the Āhavaniya fire, saying, "The consecration of Sukra" and "The consecration of Manthin".
9.10.14	Having recited "Of the unbroken one," he should be addressed in the morning, "The Soma-pressed for Indra, flowing with honey, are proceeding for the morning pressing of the one who has Soma."
9.11.1	The Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthātṛ offer at the two ends of the sacrificial post, facing away from it. The Adhvaryu offers first, then the Pratiprasthätṛ.

9.11.3	The Hotr's goblet is sent forth, the Brahman's, the Udgātṛs', the sacrificer's, the members' goblets are sent forth. The Adhvaryu and the Hotr go back, the Pratiprasthātṛ takes up the Sukra goblet.
9.11.4	Having come, the Prati-prasthātṛ pours the remaining portion into the Sukra goblet,
9.11.5	and that into the Hotr's cup.
9.11.6	They pour five portions.
9.11.7	Having called them, he sends them away, saying, "Obeisance to the name-grasping ones, to the Yajyas and the Prashashtras."

9.11.10	The Hotr sits down facing the Agni. "O Agni, you are the Yajya."
9.11.11	He consumes the offerings to the two deities.
9.11.12	The former (Hotr) is mentioned first because of the order of recitation.
9.11.13	The Hotr priest should consume the oblations and sprinkle them, as stated in the Veda.
9.11.14	The Hotr priest is the source of the words and mantras.
9.11.15	The Adhvaryu priest does not participate, because of the collective recitation.
9.11.16	Because the mantras are not prescribed.
9.11.17	And because the reasons are equal.
9.11.18	The Indra-Vayu offering is received with the words "May Vasu come, the one with many riches."
9.11.19	"May the goddess of speech, enjoying the Soma, be satisfied with the breath, svāhā."
9.11.20	Thus, in all cases, the Soma is consumed.
9.11.21	Other than the recitation,
9.11.22	"For the consumption, one says, 'May I consume,' according to the context."
9.11.23	Similarly, the other two say, 'May Vasu come, may Vasu who knows Vasu come, and may Vasu who unites Vasu come.'
9.11.24	He pours the remaining Soma into the Hotr's cup.
9.11.25	He places the cake of Indra-Vayu in the measure of a Purorasa.

9.11.29	He places Iḍa.
9.11.30	They lift up the cups.
9.12.1	They perform with the Vâjinî verses, because the Sûktavâka and Shamîvâka verses are for other purposes.
9.12.2	Or because of the non-occurrence of the mentioned fault.
9.12.3	The Soma is drunk by the Hotr with the cup.
9.12.4	Touching the limbs, they say, "O Soma, do thou nourish my limbs. O Soma, do thou be favourable to me. Do thou stand by the seven sages. Do thou sit above my navel. Do thou not go beyond my navel."
9.12.5	With two verses, "Do thou swell," they offer the cups.
9.12.6	They pour Soma with a mantra because it is not possible otherwise.
9.12.7	They place the bowls of the non-all-consuming offerings behind the southern Havirdhāna, upside down.
9.12.8	They are the Nārāśaṃsa offerings.
9.12.9	Taking a portion of the Purorāśa, he says, "We have been invoked together," and then rises.
9.12.10	He (the Adhvaryu) gives it to the Acchāvāka, saying, "Give it to the Accháváka; let him speak what he has to say."
9.12.11	When he says, "Come to us," he says, "The Brahman desires to be invoked by the Hotṛ; invoke him, O Hotṛ."
9.12.12	He recites when the Acchāváka is being invoked.
9.12.13	The Acchāvákas' goblet is being raised.
9.12.14	All the Hotr's cup and more, up to the placing down.
9.12.15	And before the Agnidhra.
9.12.16	The Adhvaryu and the Yajamana eat the Idâ from the Agnidhra's fire.
9.12.17	And the wife in another room.
9.12.18	When the Acchâvaka has sat down.
9.13.1	They proceed with the Rtugrahas.
9.13.2	"From the Dronakalasa, taken with the formula, "Thou art taken with a support for Madhu."
9.13.3	The Adhvaryu takes the first of the two cups, the Pratiprasthātṛ the second.
9.13.4	The Pratiprasthätṛ takes the first of two cups, the Adhvaryu the second.
9.13.5	Both take the first two cups together.
9.13.6	Both take together the last two cups.
9.13.7	The middle two cups are taken alternately.
9.13.8	All take together the first two cups.
9.13.9	One goes out, the other enters.
9.13.10	The Prāṭiprathātṛ takes the last of the two cups because of the time-sequence.
9.13.11	The Adhvaryu receives the cup from both sides.
9.13.12	All the offerings are made with the two foremost ones.
9.13.13	"The six are offered with the words, "To the seasons."
9.13.14	The four are offered with the word, "To all the seasons." The vessels are turned upside down.
9.13.15	The two foremost ones are offered six times.
9.13.16	The sacrificer, having been sent, should say, "O Hotṛ, offer this."
9.13.17	The Adhvaryu and
9.13.18	If he wishes, he should take the thirteenth cup, saying, "Thou art taken with a formula for the lord of oblations."
9.13.19	He offers to the assistant priest.
9.13.20	Having placed the remaining two in one place, he takes the Indra-Agni cup, saying, “To Indra-Agni, O assistant priest."
9.13.21	He brings the oblation for the Hotṛ, Potr, Neṣṭṛ, Āgnīdhra, Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin and Praśāstṛ.
9.13.22	The Hotr, Potri, Neṣṭr and Pratiprasthātṛ should exchange their vessels.
9.13.23	As much as has been said, it is because of the connection of the Hotr with the sacrificer, like the selection.
9.13.24	Or the Hotr's share is due to a reason.
9.13.25	The selection is due to non-attainment.
9.13.26	The Hotr should exchange his vessel twice.
9.13.27	Or it is so because of the offering of all (sacrifices) before (the Hotr).
9.13.28	Having taken away the Hotr' s vessel, he sits down in front.
9.13.29	Having been invoked, he responds with "Shonasa" and "Otha Modiva" at the end of the "Om" and "Pranava".
9.13.30	Or with "Om".
9.13.31	At the end of the ritual, always.
9.13.32	Or the former is at the end of speech.
9.13.33	Having taken the Indra-Agni, the Hotr recites "Hothashaya" and "Soma" at the end.
9.13.34	This is the instruction for those with weapons.
9.13.35	And the shaking of the Nārāśaṃsa verses when being offered.
9.13.36	If the Homa is performed without the placing of the fire, then it is done with weapons.
9.13.37	From the beginning of the meal, one should perform the rites up to the placing of the oblations.
9.14.1	One takes the Vaiśvadeva offering with the Sukra vessel, starting from the Dronakalaśa, reciting "O Soma, you are the lord of the gods."
9.14.2	One sprinkles the Sukra vessel with the Pūtabhṛt vessel, and joins the Pavitra with the Dronakalaša.
9.14.3	One offers the Pasupuroḍāśa first, followed by the Savanīya offerings, ending with the Payasyā.
9.14.4	Having touched the cup with grass, he says, "Let us return."
9.14.5	Thus in all cases of Dhuryas.
9.14.6	All cups are to be eaten.
9.14.7	The washing of the vessel is done in the Marjalyi.
9.14.8	He takes up the Ukthya cup, saying, "For the gods three times." Thus for all.

9.14.10	Silence is the acceptance.
9.14.11	He offers praise.

9.14.13	The first cup is offered to the one whose name is mentioned first.
9.14.14	The remaining Soma is poured into it.

9.14.16	The Soma is brought down before the Achavaka-singers.
9.14.17	The Adhvaryu pours half of the Vasatīvarī water into the Ādhavanīya with the verse, "May the All-gods, the Maruts, and Indra not forsake us in this second pressing. We, speaking what is dear to them, may be in the good opinion of the gods."
9.14.18	Half of the Ekadhana water is also poured.
9.14.19	When all have gone, the Praśāstra should say, "Proceed."
9.14.20	The moving of those who have proceeded.
10.1.1	The serpent-like movement is the Madhyandina.
10.1.2	Having placed the Vasatīvarī waters in the Hotr's goblet, he gives it to the sacrificer.
10.1.3	The Uṣṇīsa is the Gravastute.
10.1.4	He performs the Abhiṣava rites in three stages, beginning with the Adryādan.
10.1.5	He takes up the Abhiṣava.
10.1.6	Because of the non-mentioning of the Upāṃśusavana.
10.1.7	"Here, here" is the first stage.
10.1.8	The second is Avīlambita.
10.1.9	The third is Tūrṇa.
10.1.10	The fourth is Avīlambitāsthāna. The fifth is Uttama. The sixth is Bṛhat. The seventh is Bṛhat-bṛhat.

Who is Ātreya?" and once, "The one who is not from Haleya, the one who is not Avāleya, the one from Akoudreya, the one from Ashoubreya, the one who belongs to Avāmarattha, the one from Gaupavana."
10.2.22	He gives Dakṣiṇā to the priests.
10.2.23	The number of hundreds is separate due to the difference in the number of persons.

The Soma is pressed in the Soma-pressers' place. The Soma has been pressed in the Soma pressers' place.

10.3.13	The Soma is pressed in a Soma-pressing place.

10.4.12	"Recite to the Ādityas."

10.4.14	Having offered, he gives the remaining two to the Pratiprasthātṛ.
10.4.15	Here is the movement of the Aditya-graha before the hearing of the third pressing.
10.5.1	Having taken the Āgrayana, he sprinkles it in the strainer. The Pratiprasthātṛ takes the Āgrayana and the Adhvaryu takes the Avakā. The Uddhatṛ takes the Āgrayaṇa in the Upabhṛt vessel or in the Upavasana vessel.
10.5.2	The Ukthya is performed with one verse in the northern direction.
10.5.3	Pūtabhṛt, you sprinkle the blessing. May the blessing bestow on me food, nourishment, and good progeny. May it bestow wealth, good radiance, and prosperity. May it unite the fields. O Indra, making others inferior, you make the enemies inferior.
10.5.4	The wife looks at him with faith, saying, "He is a man."
10.5.5	He performs the act of going out, etc. in accordance with the Madhyandina school.
10.5.6	"O animal, speak!" is said at the place of accumulation.
10.5.7	From the morning pressing onwards, until the announcement of the Sāman chanting, and having performed the Iḍā offering, one should eat the cake and other offerings from the Ceda vessel.
10.5.8	Only with the cups.
10.5.9	Having taken up the Hotr's goblet, having announced, he says, "For the third pressing, for the one who is powerful, for the one with power, for the one possessing strength, for the one possessed by Brihaspati, for the one belonging to all the gods, for the one having a strong blessing, for Indra, the Soma-juices that have been pressed, let them be sent forth."
10.5.10	"For the one having a powerful blessing" is at the place of Sukra.
10.5.11	The Iḍā-oblation is to be eaten by the Grahas, as in the case of the Havis-oblation, in their respective cups, in the form of a Puronuvāka, without water, like the Pinda-offering to the Pitṛs, from the time of giving (the oblations) onwards, till the smelling (of the oblations).
10.5.12	Because the sacrificer has a right to the fruits of the Iḍā-offering.
10.5.13	Having eaten the Iḍā, one should take the Savitrī-graha with either the Upāṃśu or the Antaryāma vessel, saying, "May it be auspicious today."
10.5.14	At the proper time, the Patnīvata (cup) is offered to Savitr.
10.6.1	The Hotr recites the Anuvāka to Savitr. "
10.6.2	"One should offer the Maha-Vaishvadev (libation) with uncooked (food). You are taken with a purpose. You are well-protected."
10.6.3	The Hotr praises.
10.6.4	When praised with one and ten (verses), the Adhvaryu places the cups of the two-deity offerings in the Khara after washing them.
10.6.5	"The gods, with the sacrifices, have come to us." These are the three invocations.
10.6.6	And in the Svadushkilyas.
10.6.7	Having performed the washing of the vessels, one proceeds with the Soma.
10.6.8	One anoints on both sides with ghee.
10.6.9	Or on one side.
10.6.10	One says "I offer ghee" with the sound of ghee softly.
10.6.11	"I offer Soma" - one proceeds with the Somas.
10.6.12	Since the word "Sūmya" is used again, it is clear that the Soma is to be offered.
10.6.13	Having sprinkled clarified butter, he offers the Sūmya to the Udgātṛ.

12.1.4-10	The twelve-day sacrifice is the Sattra and the Ahina. The Sattra is indicated by the words "they perform the sacrifice" and the Ahina by the words "he performs the sacrifice". The Upavasatha and Atiratra are on both sides of the Ahina. The Sattra is above the Ahina. All the sacrificers participate in the Sattras. They are without Dakshina because of the connection with the owner. The householder is the performer of the sacrifice because of the connection. And because of the sight.
12.1.11	All are from the ritual.
12.1.12	Because of the statement in the Veda.
12.1.13	The householder's effort is not possible.

12.2.12	In the case of Ekapurorāśa, since there is no possibility of Vratya, one should offer a rice dish with five bowls dedicated to Indra, or a Purorāśam, if it is said to be Odanīyam or Apūpīyam.
12.2.13	Some say it is dedicated to Brhaspati.
12.2.14	The consecration is done on the twelfth day.
12.2.15	The Adhvaryu consecrates the householder, the Brahman and others, the Pratiprasthātṛ and others, the Neṣṭṛ and others, and the Unnetṛ and others. The student, the Snātaka or another Brāhmaṇa who is not pure, should purify him. This is because of the statement in the Veda.
12.2.16	The wives of the householder are consecrated one after the other.
12.2.17	They themselves are the conveyers.
12.2.18	At the time of the Dakṣiṇā, shaking the black antelope skins, reciting the mantra, they go to the southern path, saying, "Whatever has gone away from my life and is beyond this, I am conveying that Dakṣiṇī to you."

12.4.10	He throws the other one.

12.6.28	Therefore, because of the existence of tomorrow.
12.6.29	because it is not enjoined;
12.6.30	and because of the indication of the words 'today Agni';
12.6.31	The day after the Pravargya is the day of the Soma sacrifice, because there is no time for it on the next day;
12.6.32	not because of the statement;
12.6.33	Time is indicated by the words;

25.12.22	At the breaking of the pot, the Brahma-sāman should be concluded with the Vasat-call.

25.14.2	Because the fruits of the rites are not possible.
25.14.3-7	The one who is to be initiated should perform the rites of shaving the hair, nails, etc. and bathing together with the others. Having offered oblations to them, one should mix the fires. If one has no fire, one should do so in those (fires). Some say that one should offer a cake to Vaiśvānara Agni if one were to perform a sacrifice for someone else.

25.14.33	Not because of being a fee for debate.
25.14.34	But there is a fresh meal for that day.
25.14.35	Brahma should offer the expiations not prescribed.
25.14.36	Because of the statement "Brahma repairs what is destroyed".
25.14.37	And because of the union with the three Vedas.

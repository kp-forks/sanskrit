1.1.1	We shall explain the sacrifice.
1.1.2	It is for the three castes.
1.1.3	For the Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya and Vaiśya.
1.1.4	What is prescribed without being connected is common.
1.1.5	It ceases due to connection.
1.1.6	One wears the sacred thread while performing rites for the gods.
1.1.7	One wears it in the reverse direction while performing rites for ancestors.
1.1.8	One should not deviate from the rites that are connected with the rites of sipping water, etc.
1.1.9	One should also not deviate.
1.1.10	Thus is the definition of the Veda.
1.1.11	The Uddeshas (topics) are:
1.1.12	Upacharas (rituals) are to be performed in the north.
1.1.13	Deva-karmas (rituals for the gods) are to be done in the east.
1.1.14	Pitrya (rituals for ancestors) are to be conducted in the south.
1.1.15	Bahvricya (rituals for Bahvric) are to be practiced while seated.
1.1.16	Standing is to be done on command.
1.1.17	The Hotri should also do what is not commanded.
1.1.18	In groups of three or more verses, the first and last verses are to be recited three times, except in the case of Japes.
1.1.19	The Oṃkāra, which is the supreme and best of all Chandas, is placed above the initial vowel. It is pure, long, and has three mātrās.
1.1.20	It may end with the letter Ma.
1.1.21	It is called Pranava.
1.1.22	At the end, it ends with the letter Ma in all the groups of Rg verses and in the Puronuvākyās.
1.1.23	By joining it with half of the northern verse, it completes a quarter. It is called Santata.
1.1.24	He is the Dharma of all the groups of Rg verses, which are invoked by the connection with action.
1.1.25	Even in distant actions, he desires the continuity of the first Paridhananiya with half a verse.
1.1.26	The verses are based on the principle of half a verse. The other is based on the principle.
1.1.27	It is based on the statement.
1.1.28	The Rg Veda is based on the loud principle.
1.1.29	It becomes inaudible based on the statement.
1.1.30	The propriety of the order of words.
1.1.31	And the propriety of the order in which the words are uttered.
1.1.32	The Praṇava is uttered louder than the Puronuvākyā.
1.1.33	The Yajya is uttered louder than Praṇava.
1.1.34	The Vasat-kāra is uttered louder than Yajya.
1.1.35	Or equal.
1.1.36	The Praṇa-va, the Yajamāna, and the Vasat-kāras are uttered loudly, the Samprāśās and Prāśās are uttered in a low voice, and the Havis is uttered loudly.
1.1.37	The gods know it, and the Upaṃśus are in the places of the Nigamas.
1.1.38	The recitation of "bhūr bhuvaḥ" is before.
1.1.39	"We worship, Vausat, strength, power, power, heaven" is the set of four above, in all the offerings.
1.1.40	But in the Anuyājas, there is no "we worship".
1.1.41	And in the Anuvṣatkara.
1.1.42	The offering of the Vasat-call is to be done with the recitation of the Yajya-mantra in a flowing manner.
1.1.43	Or without flowing.
1.1.44	This is not applicable in the Upamshu-yaja.
1.2.1	The flowing is the invocation of the deity.
1.2.2	The Yejamana-mantra is to be recited in a flowing manner before the Yajya.
1.2.3	The flowing of the Yajna is of four measures.
1.2.4	The vowels of the Sandhi-mantras become A-i-ka-ri when they are in the place of the palate.
1.2.5	They become A-u-ka-ri in the place of lips.
1.2.6	The other letters are as they are.
1.2.7	The letters E and O are to be taken as such.
1.2.8	At the end of the Yajya.
1.2.9	The visarga becomes Repha when followed by Ri.
1.2.10	The visarja is lost when not followed by Ri. 
1.2.11	The Anusvara becomes Ma.
1.2.12	The other letters are as the natural letters.
1.2.13	The letter AU is four-matras in the Vasat-call.
1.2.14	The letter A after the letter Sha.
1.2.15	Both are as they are.
1.2.16	The former is the natural order.
1.2.17	Jāta-karṇya says that the order is natural.
1.2.18	One should recite the Barhaspatya-raithantara-sutra before the Vasat-recitation, long at the beginning and short at the end.
1.2.19	And the invocation of the deity after the Yajamana-maha-sutra, with the Puronuvakya.
1.2.20	But if there is a Prāisa, then it is not known.
1.2.21	When it is said "one should offer", ghee would be offered.
1.2.22	The word "svāhā" is at the end of the oblation mantras.
1.2.23	And also of the kindling wood mantras.
1.2.24	Due to the difference in the mantras, there is a difference in the rites.
1.2.25	The word "iti" is at the beginning of the mantras.
1.2.26	The rite is concluded with the end of the mantra.
1.2.27	The messenger should recite thus.
1.2.28	And thus he offers.
1.2.29	This is common to all sacrifices.
1.3.1	Having fasted, one performs the sacrifice with the full-moon oblation.
1.3.2	Similarly, with the new-moon oblation
1.3.3	Two full-moons
1.3.4	And two new-moons
1.3.5	The full-moon when the sun has set and the full-moon when it has risen, those are the two full-moons.
1.3.6	The new-moon when the moon is not seen and the new-moon when it is not seen tomorrow, those are the new-moons.
1.3.7	At that sacrifice, one may do as one pleases.
1.3.8	Thus, because of the injunctions in the form "on the full moon day" and "on the new moon day", they are distinguished.
1.3.9	And the words connected with them.
1.3.10	The rest is the same.
1.3.11	In both cases, the Agniya Purusa.
1.3.12	The Agnisomiya is offered silently.
1.3.13	Or the Vaishnava.
1.3.14	The Agnisomaya Purusa is offered as a cake on the full moon day.
1.3.15	The second one is for the Iindra-Agni deities, to be offered at the new moon.
1.3.16	The Iindra-Agna offering is to be offered at a Saunakiya sacrifice.
1.3.17	Or the Maheindra offering.
1.3.18	The Vaishvadeva offering is not to be offered at an Upamshuya sacrifice.
1.4.1	The Hotri, having been invited, takes up the grass and the offerings with the right foot, and then steps on the sacrificial grass.
1.4.2	The rear part of the altar should be equal to the altar.
1.4.3	Having conquered, he occupies the position.
1.4.4	He is sent forth with the formula, "To Agni who is being kindled."
1.4.5	Whom do I seek refuge in? I seek refuge in that, O Prajapati, which is your refuge. I seek refuge in the Chhandas. As much as I know of you, O Vishnu, so much I shall do. With the blessing of the divine Savitar, I shall perform the priestly duties. Obeisance to Agni, the observer. Obeisance to Vayu, the listener. Obeisance to Aditya, the companion. Today I shall speak words pleasing to the gods, attentive to human beings, flowing with our own rites to the ancestors, and established for all beings. I seek refuge with Prajapati, may there be no fear for us. I shall recite the Prajapati hymn. Speech will perform the priestly duties." Having recited "Bhuvah, Bhuvah, Svarah,"
1.4.6	Having thrice uttered "Hiṅ!"
1.4.7	Having approached with the middle voice, "May your blessings come to us."
1.4.8	The two verses beginning with "O Agni, come to us, O Agni, the invoked."
1.4.9	One verse, "We choose Agni as our messenger."
1.4.10	One verse beginning with "Kindling the sacrifice."
1.4.11	Three verses for the Saptadashi.
1.4.12	This is done on other occasions except the Darsha-Paurnamasi sacrifices.
1.4.13	"Agni is kindled, the oblation is offered" - these are two.
1.4.14	"O Agni, you are great, O Brahman, in Bharata" - having connected with the Pranava.
1.4.15	Having recited three verses from the Arsherya section, from the distant to the near, for the sacrificer.
1.4.16	But six for one of two Gotras.
1.4.17	With the Purorhita-pravara, for one who is not a Brahman.
1.4.18	Or with "Manava" for all.
1.4.19	The one who is kindled by the gods, the one who is kindled in the mind, praised by the sages, delighted by the Brahmins, praised by the poets, purified by the Vedas, the one who burns with ghee, thus is the conclusion.
1.4.20	The one who is the leader of sacrifices, the charioteer of rituals, the unerring Hotṛ, the swift one, the carrier of oblations, thus is the concluding verse.
1.4.21	The ladle is the vessel of the gods, the cup is the drink of the gods, like the rays. O Agni, you are the rim of the gods, you are the overlord. Having decided, he invites the deities.
1.4.22	Deciding, he invites the gods.
1.5.1	Bring the gods to the sacrificer.
1.5.2	Bring Agni, bring Soma. These are the two portions of clarified butter.

1.6.1	He is called a human being.
1.6.2	O Savitar, they choose thee with thy father, with Visvānara, with Indra, with Pusan, with Brihaspati. Speak forth and sacrifice. May we be in the favour of the Vasus, in the favour of Rudras, in the favour among the Adityas, among the Adityaness. When his crooked eye fell from his place as Hotar, Agni brought it back again, the all-knowing, the wise. Having recited this invocation, he proceeds.
1.6.3	Having risen, he recites with the right hand, beginning from the right shoulder of the Adhvaryu, "We approach Indra with the left hand, the Hotr, the priest, by whom the gods, the Angiras, have gone to the highest heaven. Sixty Adhvaryus and ninety nooses are spread out between heaven and earth. They spread out the cooking. I approach the wise one. May these two, heaven and earth, be auspicious to me."
1.6.4	May the six seasons, the three worlds, the six seasons, and the three worlds protect us from evil. Let the sky, earth, day, night, water, and plants be released.
1.6.5	Having turned to the right, he says, "The covering of Indra, the covering of the sun, the covering of Agni." Having turned to the right arm, he says,
1.6.6	The one who hates us and whom we hate, may he be cast out. Having removed dry grass from the Hotṛ's seat, having excluded the intermediate space towards the south and west,
1.6.7	having touched water,
1.6.8	having placed the fresh grass with the tip towards the north,
1.6.9	having sat down, one says, "I am seated in the seat of Arvāvasu."

1.6.11	"Salutations to the two Hotr priests, the heaven and earth, to the two Visvakarman, the two Tanas, may they be in my body, may they protect my body, may you not injure me, may you not torment me." Looking at the Ahavaniya and the Garhapatya fires,
1.6.12	moving towards the north, he says, "This is your space."
1.6.13	The All-gods, the teachers, know that today. Having recited "Salutations to the great words,"
1.6.14	Agni is the Hotar, Agni knows the Hotar, knows the Praitra, your deity is well-sacrificed. Having decided thus,
1.6.15	"He who Agni as the Hotar without falsehood" is whispered.
1.6.16	O Adhvaryu, pour the ghee into the ladle which is full of ghee, which is divine, which is for all purposes. We invoke the gods. I invoke other gods. I honour those who are to be honoured.

1.14.17	Having mentioned the names of the sacrificer as 'this one' and 'that one', he desires the subsequent offering to the gods. He desires the offering of more oblations, he desires longevity, he desires good progeny, he desires the divine world.
1.14.18	Whatever he has desired with this oblation, may he obtain it, may he prosper. May the gods grant him that. May Agni, the god, grant that to the gods. We are the human beings around Agni.
1.14.19	May what is desired and what is accomplished be both of them. May heaven and earth protect him from sin. May this be the way of the good. This is the homage to the gods.
1.14.20	Having placed the Anjali on the sacrificial grass, he recites.

1.15.5	As he says, "Do thou call the Ida," he calls her.
1.15.6	"This is the call of the sacrificer," is a variant.
1.15.7	The Patnīsaṃyājas end with the word 'Idā'.
1.15.8	Or they end with the word Śamyu.
1.15.9	"He says, "I release you," releasing the Veda from the yoke."
1.15.10	Having made the Veda and the yoke free in the palms of the wife,
1.15.11	Sprinkling the Veda and the rope with water, he mutters:
1.15.12	For Kama thee, thou art Veda. By that by which thou hast become Veda to the gods, do thou become Veda to us. Thou art Veda, thou art knowledge, thou art the thing to be known, thou art the doing, thou art the instrument, thou art the union of action, thou art the uniting, thou art the unitee.
1.15.13	May the Veda give thee the one who is full of ghee, the one who has a family, the one who is the growth of wealth, the one who possesses a thousand, the one who gives strength. Thus the Veda recites the Veda.
1.15.14	She takes up the grass and lies down between her knees.
1.15.15	"Having woven the thread, having placed the grass on the north of the Garhapatya, he says, "Do you sprinkle the grass with water."

3.19.9	If the Āhavaniya fire is not taken up, it should be taken up by a learned Brāhmaṇa. The gold should be tied to the tip of a Kuśa grass and taken forward. Silver should be taken when the sun has risen. The Dakṣiṇā is the best.
3.19.10	When the Āhavaniye fire has followed, it should be brought from the Garhapatya fire. The Agni Ceṣṭi is for the Jyotiṣmata Agni.
3.19.11	O Agni, may your pure lights shine forth.
3.19.12	Having placed the Garhapatya fire in front, one should offer oblations to the Anvähävyä fire, having brought it from another place.
3.19.13	Having ascended, one should offer to the Udagga fire.
3.19.14	In the case of both fires having been followed, the churning should be done from the Garhapatyä fire towards the Udagga.

3.20.1	If the Agnihotra-cow is attacked by a disease, one should give a handful of barley.
3.20.2	If he sits down, then he should say, "You sit down out of fear. Therefore, grant us freedom from fear for all beings. Be kind to all. Salutations to Rudra, the nourisher." Having raised him with a wet stick, the goddess Aditi stood up and placed life in the sacrificial thread, making a share for Indra, Mitra, and Varuna. One should recite this.
3.20.3	One should give it to an enemy.
3.20.4	When the oblation is consumed, the two who are the most powerful, the most heroic, the most vigorous, the most brilliant, the most unapproachable, the most powerful, Vishnu and Varuna, have gone to the sacrifice. Having brought them with water, he has run to the sky. The gods have gone to the third sacrifice. May they bestow wealth on me. The ancestors have gone to the middle space. The third sacrifice has gone to the earth. The men have gone to the earth, the third sacrifice. There may they bestow wealth on us. He should recite this mantra.

3.20.6	The water is the first part.
3.20.7	If there is a remainder, it is to be completed with that.
3.20.8	If there are no remainders, one should produce another.
3.20.9	If that substance is not available, one should substitute what one considers to be the most similar.
3.20.10	This is the rule for substitutes.
3.20.11	And the words are unchanged.
3.20.12	If the deity is not offered, there is no repetition of the Hotr's duty. Having prepared another oblation, one should offer it to the deity.
3.20.13	There is no repetition if the deity is offered with a fault. The Svishtakrit, the Idam, and the Bhaksas are omitted.
3.20.14	With ghee, the highest.
3.20.15	If other deities have been offered or if there is a fault in the remaining part of the procedure, the offering is repeated.
3.20.16	If all are offered, there is repetition in the remaining.
3.20.17	The non-recurrence of the rite performed is due to the predominance of the rite of Sannipat.

15.16.12	And indeed it happened just as he had said.
15.16.13	Therefore one should perform the sacrifice with four Stotras.
15.16.14	The four Stotras are the foundation of sacrifices.

15.17.1	King Harischandra, the son of Vaishravana, had a hundred wives, but he had no son. He lived with Parvata and Narada. He asked Narada, "What do those who know and those who do not know desire for this son? What does one obtain by having a son? Please tell us, O Narada." When asked by one, he replied with ten. "One who has a son attains immortality. The father sees the face of his son when he is born. All the enjoyments on earth, all the knowledge of the fire, all the living beings in the water, the son is greater than the father. The fathers always go to the son, to the great darkness. The self is born from the self. It is the one who crosses over. What is the stain? What is the garment? What are the whiskers? What is austerity? Brahma desires the son. He is the world, the one who speaks. Food, breath, refuge, clothing, form, gold, cattle, marriages, friends, wife, the miserly daughter, light, the son, the supreme sky, the husband enters the wife as the embryo, then the mother. Again being new in her, he is born in the tenth month. That wife becomes the wife of the one who is born again in her. This is the prosperity, this is the seed that is deposited. The gods and the sages gathered great splendor. The gods said to the humans, "This is your mother again." This is the path, the path of the gods, which the sons, the ones without sorrow, follow. The animals and birds see it. Therefore they engage in sexual intercourse even with their mothers. "There is no world for one without a son." All the animals know this. Therefore the son mounts his mother and sister.
15.18.1.a	He said, "Tell me how my son will be born." He said, "Approach King Varuna. Let your son be born. I will sacrifice to you with that." He said, "Let it be so." He approached King Varuna. "Let my son be born. Let me sacrifice to you with it." He said, "Let it be so." His son was born, named Rohita. Varuna said, "Your son has been born. Sacrifice to me with it." He replied, "When an animal is without teeth, then it becomes fit for sacrifice. Let it be without teeth, then I will sacrifice to it." He said "Let it be so". It became without teeth. He said, "Its teeth have fallen out. Sacrifice to me." He replied, "When an animal's teeth fall out, then it becomes suitable for sacrifice. Let its teeth fall out, and then I will sacrifice." He said, Let it be so". Its teeth fell out. He said, "Its teeth have fallen. Sacrifice to me." He replied, " When a Kshatriya puts on armor, then he becomes suitable for sacrifice." He put on armor. He said, "Has the armor been put on? Sacrifice to me." He said, "It has been put on." Having said this, he addressed his son, "This one has given you to me. I will sacrifice with you to him." He said, "No." Taking up a bow, he went to the forest. He wandered in the forest for a year. Then King Ikṣvāku was seized by Varuna. His belly became swollen. Rohita heard about it and came from the forest to the village. Indra approached him in the form of a man and said,
15.19.1	The Brahman said, "Rohitha, we have heard that you are wandering in various places. The sinner Nisadvara is your friend. You are wandering with him." Rohitha said, "The Brahman said this to me." He wandered in the forest for a second year. He came from the forest to the village. Indra approached him in the form of a man and said, "The Blessed One is above the seated one, above the standing one, above the lying one, above the sleeping one, above the wandering one. The Brahman said this to Rohitha." He wandered in a forest for a third year. He came to the village from the forest. Indra approached him and said, "Kali is the sleeping man, Dvapara is the yawning man, Treta is the rising man, and Krita is the wandering man." The Brahman said this." He wandered in forests for a fourth year. He came back to the village from there. Indra approached him there and said, "When wandering, the feet are blooming, the body is the fruit-eater, all sins are sleeping, and fatigue is destroyed on the path." The Brahman said, "Rohitha, you are wandering." He wandered in forests in the fifth year. He came here from there. Indra came to him and said, "When wandering, one finds honey, when wandering, one finds the ripe Udumbara fruit. See the fatigue of the sun, who does not sleep while wandering." The Brahman said, 'Rohitha, wander.' He wandered in forests during the sixth year. He came there from there. Indra went to him and said: 'When wandering, one gets honey, when cutting grass, one gets Parushaka. When rising, one gets prosperity. What does the seated one get? The Brahman said, ''Rohitha, roam.'' He wandered in forests the seventh year. He went to the forest where the sage Sauyavasama was eating his son who was not yet dead.
15.20.1	He had three sons, Shunahpuccha, Shunashépa, and Shunolangula. He said to him, "I want to redeem myself with one of them. I will give you a hundred cows." When he was about to take the eldest, he said, "Not this one." "Not this one either." The mother made peace between the two, and Shunashépa. Having given him a hundred cows, he took him and went from the forest to the village. Having approached his father, he said, "Now I want to redeem myself by this one." He said, "So be it," and invited King Varuna, saying, "I will sacrifice to you with this one." He agreed, saying, "The brahmin is indeed superior to the kshatriya." Therefore he told him this Rajasuya sacrifice. He offered this man as an animal in the Rajasuya.
15.21.1	Now, when the sacrifice was being performed for him, they did not find a director for the one who had been appointed. He said, "Ajigarta Sauyavasi, give me another hundred (cows) and I will direct him." They gave him another hundred (cows). He directed him. When he had been appointed and set on fire, they did not know a distributor for him. He said, “Ajigarta Sauya-vasi, give me yet another hundred (cows), and I will distribute him." They gave another hundred (cows to him). He went to the house of Ajigarta Sauyavasis with a sword in his hand. Then Shunahshepa thought, "They will distribute me like a non-human. Let me run to the gods."
15.22.1	He approached Prajapati first among the gods with this verse: "Whose is the nectar among the gods?" Prajapati said to him: "You are Agni's most beloved. Approach him." He approached Agni with this verse: "We approach Agni, the first among the gods." Agni said to him: "Savitar is the lord of births. Approach him." Savitar said to him: "Varuna, the king, has appointed you. Approach him." Varuna said to him: Agni is the mouth of the gods, the friend. Praise him, then I will release you." He praised Agni with these twenty-two verses: "The great ones, the young ones - to them be homage." The All-Gods said to him: Indra is the lord of the gods. Praise him, and we will release you." Indra said to him: The Ashvins are the physicians. Praise them, and I will release you. The Ashvins said to him: Usha is the dawn. Praise her, and we will let you go." Usha said to him: Then the priests said to him: You have attained the end of this day.
15.23.1	Then indeed Anjasas Sapta had seen him, for he had said, "You are indeed in every house." Having offered him with these four verses, he brought the residue of the oblation into the pot, which was the size of a Drona. Then he began to follow him, and offered him with the first four verses of this very hymn. Then indeed he brought him into the Avabhrtha. "You are indeed the lowest, O Agni, you are indeed the lowest," with these two verses. Then indeed he placed Agni before him, with the verse, "Shunahshepa, the hidden, from a thousand."
15.24.1	Then Shunaḥshepa approached Vishvamitra. He said to him, "Ajegarta Sauyavasi says, 'Give me back my son.' Vishvamitra replied, 'The gods have taken him from me.' There was a son of Vishvamitra named Devratha. Ajegarta Sau-yavasi said to him, 'Bring him back to me.' He said, 'Yes.' The sage Ajegarta, born of Angiras, is known as the one who brought back the cattle. O sage, come back to me from your ancestral land.' Shunaḥshepha said, 'You saw him with a stick in your hand, but you did not desire him among the Shudras. You chose three hundred cows, O son of Angiras.' Ajegarta said, 'O son, that sinful deed I did is indeed burning me. I confess it to you. Let there be a hundred cows as compensation.' Shunaḥ-shepha said, ‘One who commits a sin once should commit another. You have done something that should not be done from the Shudra’s point of view.’ He said, ‘It should not be done.’ Vishvamitra justified himself.
15.25.1	Bhima alone, by his authority, ruled over the kingdom. The son of Maita said, "Come to me as my son." Then Shunahshepa said, "O prince, please tell me how I can become your son, just as Angiras did." Vishvamitra replied, "You will be my eldest son, and your offspring will be the best. Come to me as my divine heir. I will instruct you with that." Shunahshepa replied, "Please tell me in the presence of my kinsmen, for the sake of friendship and prosperity, so that I may become your son, O bull among Bharatas." Then Vishvamitra addressed his sons:
15.26.1	O Madhucchada, listen! Rishabha, Renu, Asthaka, and all the brothers who are older than him, stand for his seniority. He had one hundred sons, fifty were older and Madhucchada's, fifty were younger. Those who were older did not think of him as skillful. He instructed them, "May your offspring be destroyed at the end." They are the Andhras, Pundras, Sabaras, and Mucchipa. The Vaishvamitras are the most numerous among the Dasus, who are to the north, with abundant crops. Then those who were younger, beginning with Madhucchada thought of him as skillful, and he sang: "O Madhucchada! We will stand in him whom our father recognizes. We all do this for you. We are following you." Then Vishvamitra praised his sons.
15.27.1	Those who follow my rule will be sons, having cattle and offspring, and will make it heroic. May all the sons of the gods, the leaders, be prosperous. This is what I have declared to you. This is your hero, Kushika, the god-fearing one, whom you follow. You and your gifts are united with the knowledge that we know. They, the sons of Vasishtha, all together with their allies, stood with Devavrata, the god-fearer, for seniority and supremacy. Devavrata, as the sage of both inheritances, stood with the Jhanus, the god-knowers, in the divine Veda. This is the story of Shunahshepa, consisting of a hundred verses, unlimited. The officiating priest recites it to the seated Hiranyakashipu. The seated Hiranyakasipu receives it. "Om" is the response to the verses. "Thus it is" is the response of the verses. "Om" indeed is divine, and "thus it is" is human. By the divine and the human, he is released from all misfortune. Therefore, even if a king is not victorious, or does not offer sacrifices, he should recite this story of Shunahsepa, for there is no misfortune left in it. A thousand for the reciter, a hundred for the respondent. These are the seats. Those who desire sons recite it and obtain sons.
16.1.1	Prajapati desired, 'May I obtain all desires, may I enjoy all the worlds.' He saw this three-day sacrifice, the horse sacrifice, and performed it. Having performed it, he obtained all desires, enjoyed all the worlds. In the same way, the sacrificer, when he performs the horse sacrifice, obtains all desires, enjoys all the worlds.
16.1.2	He offers four cups of Mahārtivik grains, four cups of Anjali grains, and four cups of Prasrita grains.
16.1.3	It is of twelve kinds.

16.1.12	Agni is the mouth of the gods; he thus propitiates the gods with their own mouth.
16.1.13	Then he offers a cake on eight potsherds to Pūṣan, the maker of paths.
16.1.14	Pūṣan is the lord of paths; he makes it a means of welfare for the horse.
16.1.15	They release the horse at the end of the year, having all forms, endowed with speed, and capable of fulfilling all desires, except for sexual intercourse.
16.1.16	One hundred princes, clad in armour, with bows, sons of the chief charioteers, with girdles, sons of the collectors of the Kshatriya-s, with staves, protect the horse, not letting it go.
16.1.17	Then to Savitri, the bestower of offspring, to Savitri, to the bestower of wealth, to Savitri who bestows truth, the oblations are offered for a year.
16.1.18	Savitar is the impeller, may he impel this sacrifice for me.
16.1.19	Savitar is the impeller of the sun, may he impell this sacrifice for me."
16.1.20	Savitar is truth-impelling, may he impcll this sacrifice for me with truth-impelling.
16.1.21	He who has gone to all these beings born, the god Savitar, the giver of good gifts, all the gods, Savitar, he is our god Savitar, who gives all gifts, who does not deceive us.
16.1.22	The Hotṛ also recites the Pariplavya verse.
16.1.23	When addressed as "O Adhvaryu!" he responds everywhere with "O Hotṛ!"
16.1.24	When the Hotṛ recites, he responds with "O Hotar, so be it!"
16.1.25	Then the Adhvaryu instructs the Vīṇā and Gaṇḍī players, saying, "Sing him with the ancient righteous kings."
16.2.1	"Manu Vaivasvata" is the first verse.
16.2.2	The men of that (Manu) are the Visas. They sit here. Thus the householder instructs.

16.4.5	The followers of the horse-keepers, of the same caste, follow them in hundreds. They attack each other.
16.4.6	Your mind, O Hotṛ, seems to be longing for something. Do not speak much. The gods have made the Śūdra the husband of the woman of noble birth. This is a variant in the context of mutual reproach.

16.6.1.1	I ask you, O Citra, friend of the gods, if you know in your mind, in which of the three steps Vishnu is worshipped, in which of them the universe has entered.
16.6.1.2	I am in those three steps in which the universe has entered, I roam over the earth and heaven in a moment, with one part of my body I cover the sky.
16.6.1.3	In whom did the man enter? What was entrusted to the man? O Brahman, you have come to me. What did you say to me here?

16.7.5	Or to Indra-Agni.

16.7.7	What is the hurry? So says Indrotas Saunaka.
16.7.8	They should perform with different deities.
16.7.9	Together with the deities of the same kind, but not in order.

16.7.14	The desire that is in the Ekâhas, and the desire that is in Pañchahas, for the attainment of both.
16.7.15	One should perform the Ekāhika and the Bārhaspatya Prāgasamājas.

Having gone around the Agnīdhriya mound from the north, having entered the Sadas through the eastern door, and having placed it in front of the Hotr's mound facing east.
17.7.12	In the same way, whatever is outside the Veda, one should take it and place it to the north, as it is used in the moving and spreading.
17.7.13	"It should be the Trishtubh at the morning pressing," says Pingya, the son of Sushkabhrigari.

17.10.7	The Hotṛ measures it with his head.
17.10.8	If it is short, he measures it with his arm raised.
17.10.9	He measures it with the firm and well-rounded (bamboo-pole) so that they do not get hurt.
17.10.10	Then he fixes this movable plank with ropes at four places so that it does not fall down.
17.10.11	The northern rope is tied to the northern post, and the southern rope to the southern post.
17.10.12	The northern rope is tied around the northern post, the southern rope around the southern post. The two ropes are tied together.
17.10.13	The two ropes are tied to the two posts. The two ropes should be tied together in such a way that they are at a distance of a span above the ground.
17.10.14	Below that, he spreads out the Kusha grass with their tips pointing towards the east and the west.
17.10.15	He spreads it around so that it does not become uncomfortable.
17.10.16	Having bound it, he places it on the northern pillar.

Svāhā. This is the first (verse).
17.12.2	"To the sky, svāhā! To the atmosphere, svāhā!" These are three.
17.12.3	"To the cow, svāhā, to speech, svāhā," and "To the lord of speech, svāha!" These are three more.

17.13.6	If the Uttaravedi is there, one should attend to these parts of the fire that is burning.
17.13.7	Standing here itself, one attends to the sun.
17.13.8	Some say that they should make the sky the hall.
17.13.9	But one attends to it by means of the region.
17.13.10	"You are the best, O Suparna, the light of the gods, with your body of truth, you shine. May you shine with that, may you generate with that, may I be protected with that. May you bestow upon me the radiance of brahminical splendor and food. May you be praised, may you not harm me."

17.15.13	Then, placing the Pradeśakā-plate, he says three times, "May it be well-blessed."
17.16.1	Then, touching it with his chest, and passing over the right part of his body, he mutters, "Thou art the sun. The Vasus are mounting thee with the Gayatri metre. I mount them for the kingdom."

17.17.6	He makes the earth-drum resound.
17.17.7	The sounds of the drums cease.

1.1.1	The Dharma has been taught in the Vedas.
1.1.2	We shall explain it in accordance with that.
1.1.3	The second is Smriti.
1.1.4	The third is the tradition of the learned.
1.1.5	The learned are those who are free from envy, ego, greed, avarice, and are devoid of deceit, pride, greed, delusion, and anger.
1.1.6	Those who have acquired the Veda along with its supplements through Dharma, and those who know it through inference from them, are the witnesses of the Veda.
1.1.7	In its absence, a group of ten is the minimum.
1.1.8	They also quote: The four Vedas, the option, the knower of the limbs, the reciter of Dharma, the three Brahmins in the stages of life - this is the group of ten.
1.1.9	Five may be, three may be, one may be, but not the other thousand, if he is faultless. The speaker of Dharma is the only one, not the others.
1.1.10	Just as an elephant made of wood, just as a deer made of skin, and a brahmin who does not study - these three are only names.
1.1.11	Whatever the ignorant and deluded say, not knowing Dharma, that sin, having become a hundredfold, reaches the speakers.
1.1.12	The path of Dharma, which has many doors, is subtle and difficult to follow. Therefore, even the very learned should not speak about it, when there is doubt.
1.1.13	The twice-born, mounted on the chariot of Dharma-shastras, holding the sword of the Vedas, even if they speak for fun, that is considered the highest Dharma.
1.1.14	Just as water held in a stone is destroyed by wind and sun, so also the sin committed against the doer perishes like water.
1.1.15	Having examined the body, strength, life, age, time, and action, a person knowledgeable in Dharma should prescribe expiations with intelligence.
1.1.16	Those who are not observing vows, do not know mantras, and subsist only on their caste, even if they gather in thousands, do not constitute a congregation."
1.2.1	There are five kinds of disagreement, some to the right and some to the left.
1.2.2	We will explain those that are to the right.
1.2.3	As for the eating with one who is not related, eating with a woman, eating stale food, and having intercourse with one’s maternal uncle’s daughter or sister’s daughter.
1.2.4	Then, above that, selling wool, drinking liquor, dealing with those who have two sets of teeth, dealing with those in the profession of arms, and going to sea.
1.2.5	One who does something that is prohibited in one place, does something that is permitted in another place.

1.2.5	One who does something that is prohibited in one place, does something that is permitted in another place.
1.2.6	In this case, the authority of the country would be the only criterion.

1.2.8	Both should be ignored, because they are contrary to the Smṛtis of the good.
1.2.9	The Aryāvarta is the land between the Himalayas in the north, the Vindhyas in the south, the eastern ocean in the east and the western ocean in the west. The conduct of the people in this land is authoritative.
1.2.10	Some say that the land between the Ganges and the Yamuna is the Aryāvarta.
1.2.11	Now the Bhallāvins recite a verse here:
1.2.12	"The Sindhu is behind, the Vidharani is in front of the rising of the sun, as long as the black ones run, so long is the Brahmic lustre."
1.2.13	The Avantis, Angas, Magadhas, Surāṣṭras, Dakṣiṇāpatha, Sindhu and Sauvīras are of mixed origin.

1.2.14	Having gone to the Āraṭṭas, Kāraskaras, Puṇḍras, Sauvīras, Vaṅgas, Kaliṅgas, and Prānus, one should again perform the sacrifice with the Stoma. One should perform with all the Prsthas.
1.2.15	They also say: "He who commits a sin by going to the Kaliṅgas, the sages have said that the offering to Vaisvānara is the atonement."

1.3.46	Katyāyana says that one should greet them in return.
1.3.47	One should greet a child and an Angirasa on seeing them.
1.4.1	Where there is no Dharma and Artha, or where there is no service as prescribed, one should die with that knowledge, and not sow it on barren land.

1.4.3	Thus they convey their words to him.

1.4.7	When a brahmin student enters the four stages of life, he enters the fire, death, the teacher, and himself. The fourth stage is left out. When he offers a twig to the fire, he buys back the stage that belongs to the fire. Having purified it, he places it in himself, and it enters him. Then, when he becomes poor and begs, having made himself poor and become shameless, he practices celibacy. When he begs, he buys back what belongs to death. Having purified it and placed it in himself, it enters him. When he does what the teacher says, he buys back that which belongs to the teacher. Having purified it he places it in his self, and it enters. When he studies his own lessons, he buys back his own self. Having purified it himself, he places it within himself, and it then enters him. One should not beg after bathing. One may beg after bathing, for the sake of one's relatives, for the sake one's ancestors, and for the sake of other rites. If one does not find anyone else to beg from, one may beg from one's teacher's wife or one's own mother. One should not let the seventh day pass without begging.
1.4.8	If one does not eat alms, or if one does not kindle the fire, one should perform the Avakīrṇi vow for seven nights.
1.4.9	Those who know this and practice it, all the Vedas enter them.

1.5.10	Or he should beg for alms.
1.5.11	He should stand with restraint of speech.
1.5.12	And he should perform all his rites of livelihood connected with the gods and ancestors.
1.5.13	Thus, by this method, the supreme sages of Prajapati Parameshthin attain the highest state. This is the view of Baudhayana.

1.6.6	If the water-pot is broken, one should offer a hundred oblations with the Vyāhṛtis or recite them.

1.6.15	Baudhāyana says that one is pure up to the binding of the gem.

2.2.9-10	Having performed any one of these, they should eat in moderation at the fourth time of the day, and drink water, following the ritual of the Savana. Engaging in dwelling and sitting, they can destroy that sin in three years.
2.2.24	For those who have been born from impure semen, there is expiation if they so desire.
2.2.25	For those who have fallen, the third part is for women, the third part.
2.2.26	And they also say: "Whatever one does with sesame seeds other than eating and anointing, one becomes a worm in dog excrement and sinks with one's ancestors."
2.2.11-12	The sin which a Brāhmaṇa commits in one night by serving a Kṛṣṇa-varṇa (i.e. a Śūdra) is removed by him in three years by bathing at the proper time.
2.2.27	He who sells sesamum seeds is selling his ancestors. He who sells rice is selling his life. He who gives his daughter in marriage is selling his share of good deeds.
2.2.28	Grass and wood may be sold without being altered.
2.2.29	But they also quote: "The cattle have one tooth, and the salt-extracted stone; this is your merchandise, O Brahman, and the thread is made of wool."
2.2.30	One should give a cow to a student who has committed a sin, after anointing her with clarified butter and sprinkling her with black sesame seeds.
2.2.31	Or for twelve days with Kūṣmāṇḍa.
2.2.13	Going to a forbidden woman, to a friend of the Guru, to a friend who is a Guru, to an unworthy woman, to a fallen woman, and administering medicine, performing village sacrifices, living by the stage, being a teacher of dancing, protecting cows and buffaloes, and any other similar act that defiles a virgin, are the causes of loss of caste.
2.2.14	But their penance is the practice of the fallen, for two years.
2.2.15	Now the causes of impurity:
2.2.32	One is freed from the sin of abortion, if one performs this penance.
2.2.33	One should perform the Kṛcchra penance for the accusation of a major sin.
2.2.34	The accuser should perform it for a year.
2.2.35	One falls down in a year, if one performs the rites of teaching and officiating at sacrifices, but not the rites of riding, sleeping and eating, of one who has fallen down.
2.2.17	The period of their service is twelve months, twelve half-months, twelve days, twelve six-day periods, twelve three-day periods, one day, six days, three days, one day and night, one day.
2.2.36	The expiation for eating impure food is the Naishadha penance, which is completed in seven days.
2.2.37	Drinking water, milk, ghee, and performing the Paraka penance for three days each, consecutively, is the Taptakrichchhra penance.
2.2.38	Eating only in the morning and evening for three days, without begging, is the Krichchhra penance.
2.2.18	Then those who have fallen would live together, practising the duties, being each other's priests, each other's teachers, and marrying each other. Having produced sons, they would say, "O brahmins, go forth from here." They would thus be in agreement with the noble ones.
2.2.19	But if one who has fallen does not fall again,
2.2.20	then it should be known that even one who is deficient in limbs can produce a complete child.
2.2.39-43	The three Prāgāka, Prāgāmaka and Prāgāmaika are the Kṛcchra for women, children and old people. One should eat as much as one takes at a time. This is the Ati-Kṛcchra. The third is the Abbhāsa. This is the Kṛcchrātikṛcchra. The Kṛcchra is the drinking of water three times. Sleeping on the ground.
2.2.21	This is false, says Hārīta.
2.2.22	Women are like the curd-pot, for when a man, without effort, churns milk in a curd-pot, the remaining milk is not used for any religious purpose.
2.2.23	Similarly, the semen that is produced from impurity is not used in conjunction with it.
2.2.44	Wearing only one cloth, shaving the hair, beard, body hair and nails.
2.2.45	This is the same for women, except for shaving the hair.
2.3.1	One who is always bathing, always wearing the sacred thread, always studying, avoiding the food of a vrsala, having intercourse during the season, and offering oblations according to the prescribed method, does not fall from the world of Brahman.
2.2.24	For those who have been born from impure semen, there is expiation if they so desire.
2.2.25	For those who have fallen, the third part is for women, the third part.
2.2.26	And they also say: "Whatever one does with sesame seeds other than eating and anointing, one becomes a worm in dog excrement and sinks with one's ancestors."
2.3.2	Manu divided the inheritance among his sons, so says the Śruti.
2.3.3	All of them should get equal shares, because there is no distinction.
2.3.4	The eldest son should take the best or the most beautiful.
2.3.5	Therefore, the Śruti says that the eldest son should be given wealth without any condition.
2.3.6	The eldest should take one out of ten.
2.3.7	The others should divide equally.
2.2.27	He who sells sesamum seeds is selling his ancestors. He who sells rice is selling his life. He who gives his daughter in marriage is selling his share of good deeds.
2.2.28	Grass and wood may be sold without being altered.

2.3.12	If the son of a co-wife is superior to the son of the next wife, then he shall take the share of the elder.
2.3.13	For the superior son is the protector of the others.
2.2.32	One is freed from the sin of abortion, if one performs this penance.
2.2.33	One should perform the Kṛcchra penance for the accusation of a major sin.
2.2.34	The accuser should perform it for a year.
2.2.35	One falls down in a year, if one performs the rites of teaching and officiating at sacrifices, but not the rites of riding, sleeping and eating, of one who has fallen down.
2.3.14-15	If a son is born to a woman of the same caste as himself, begotten by himself, he should know that he is his own son. Or they say: "You are born from limb to limb, you are born from the heart, you are named the Self, live for a hundred autumns." Accepting that a son is born from a daughter, he is the son of the daughter, another grandson.
2.2.36	The expiation for eating impure food is the Naishadha penance, which is completed in seven days.

2.2.39-43	The three Prāgāka, Prāgāmaka and Prāgāmaika are the Kṛcchra for women, children and old people. One should eat as much as one takes at a time. This is the Ati-Kṛcchra. The third is the Abbhāsa. This is the Kṛcchrātikṛcchra. The Kṛcchra is the drinking of water three times. Sleeping on the ground.
2.3.19	If one offers the balls of rice to two fathers, then the names of the two fathers should be mentioned in each ball. If one offers six balls, then one should not be confused.
2.3.20	A child is given by the mother and father or by one of them for the purpose of offspring.
2.3.21	If one gives a child to another who is similar and has desire, then that is artificial.
2.2.44	Wearing only one cloth, shaving the hair, beard, body hair and nails.
2.2.45	This is the same for women, except for shaving the hair.

2.3.34	Now, O father of women, I am jealous of women, not of old, because in Yama's abode they say to the son of the creator, "The one who gives seed takes the son to Yama's abode." Therefore, those who are afraid of other men's seed should protect their own wives.

2.5.18	Here are two verses from the Annagita: He who eats without giving to his father, to the gods, to his servants, guests, and friends, eats poison out of delusion. I am that food, and I am his death. He who eats me with faith, having offered Agnihotra and Visvedeva, having honoured guests and servants, satisfied, pure, and believing, he is immortal, and he enjoys me.

2.7.14	For the continuity of the day and night, and for the completion of the twilight.

2.7.19	And at night he is bound, but Varuna does not seize him.
2.7.20	Thus, having risen in the morning, one is freed from the sin committed during the night.
2.7.21	And during the day he is bound, and Mitra protects him, and the sun leads him to the heavenly world.
2.6.42	The sin is appeased by the oblation, the oblation is appeased by food, and the food is appeased by charity. This is what we have heard.
2.7.1	Now we shall explain the method of worshipping at twilight.
2.8.1	Then having washed the hands, having taken the water-pot and the ball of clay, having gone to a sacred place, one should wash the feet three times and the body three times.

2.7.7	Or, mentally reciting it ten times with the Pranava at the beginning and end and the seven Vyahrtis.
2.7.8	Or, with three breath controls and the Brahma Hrdaya.
2.8.6	Then having touched water, he turns the water three times clockwise, saying, "Whatever is cruel in the water, whatever is impure, whatever is not peaceful, may that depart."
2.8.7	Having submerged and emerged in the water,
2.8.8	There is no bathing, washing of clothes, or touching of water for one who is in the water.
2.8.9	If they are obstructed, he worships with this: "Salutations to Agni, the one with water, salutations to Indra, salutations to Varuna, salutations to Varuṇī, salutations to the waters."
2.7.9	He worships the night with the two verses addressed to Varuna: "O Varuna, this is mine. I come to you."
2.7.10	Similarly, in the morning, standing facing east.

2.7.12	One should complete the worship after sunrise, having begun with the Supūrva and Pūrva verses.
2.7.13	Having performed the evening twilight worship, one should perform the morning twilight worship.
2.7.14	For the continuity of the day and night, and for the completion of the twilight.
2.8.10	Having crossed and sipped water, he should sip again. May the waters purify the earth. May the purified earth purify me. May the waters and Brahman-pati purify me. May Brahman, purified, purify me. Whatever is left over, unfit to be eaten, or whatever bad conduct I have done, may all the waters purify me. May all the waters purify my acceptance of the wicked. Svāhā!
2.7.15	And here are two verses from the Prajapati-gita: Those Brahmanas who do not worship the evening twilight before it has come and the morning twilight after it has gone, how are they remembered as Brahmanas? Those Brahmanas who always do not worship the twilight in the evening and morning, the righteous king may employ them in the duties of a Shudra.
2.7.16	If one transgresses in the evening, one should fast for the night; if one transgresses in morning, one should fast during the day.
2.7.17	One attains the fruit of the place and seat.
2.7.18	It is also said: Whatever sin is committed by the body, or by the feet, or by the arms, or by the mind, or by speech, having worshipped the evening twilight, one is freed from that.
2.8.11	Having purified himself with water, he cleanses himself with the three verses, "The waters are pure, the waters are purifying," and the four verses, "The golden-colored, pure, purifying ones," and the verse, "Pavamana, the purifier," having cleansed himself with this Anuvaka, having gone into the water, having held the three Prāṇāyāmas while reciting the Aghamarṣaṇa, having emerged, having pressed his clothes, having washed them, having put on the clothes that are not distressed, having sipped water, having sat on Kuśas, holding the Kuśas, facing east, he should recite the Sāvitrī a thousand times, or a hundred times, or an unlimited number of times, but not less than ten.
2.7.19	And at night he is bound, but Varuna does not seize him.
2.7.20	Thus, having risen in the morning, one is freed from the sin committed during the night.
2.7.21	And during the day he is bound, and Mitra protects him, and the sun leads him to the heavenly world.
2.8.12	Then he worships the sun: "We rise above the darkness, we rise above the darkness. That bright eye of the god, which has risen, is the eye of the god."
2.8.13	And they also say: "The Pranava, the Vyahrtis, and Savitri - these five are the Brahma sacrifices. They purify the Brahmana from sin every day."
2.7.22	Thus, he who stands at the junction of day and night, becomes pure in Brahman, becomes Brahman, and becomes a Brahman, following the scriptures, is said to conquer the world of Brahman.
2.8.14	He is purified by the five Brahmayajnas and then offers oblations to the deities.
2.9.1	"Om, Agni, Prajapati, Soma, Rudra, Aditi, Brihaspati, and Serpents - these are the deities of the eastern gate, along with their stars, planets, day and night, and Muhurtas. I offer oblations to them. Om, I offer oblations also to the Vasus."

Whatever I have eaten from the wicked and accepted from sinners, whatever evil I have done with mind, speech, or deed, may Indra, Varuna, Brihaspati, and Savitar purify it again and again."

"Om, now I offer water to great-grandfathers, Svāhã."

2.10.3	He sprinkles water around the Tīrtha.
2.10.4	"The waters flowing with nourishment, nectar, ghee, milk, and juice, may it be Svāhā. Satisfy my ancestors. May they be satisfied, may they be satisfied, they are satisfied."
2.10.5	One should not perform the rites of the gods wearing only one garment or wet garments.
2.10.6	Some say that these rites are connected with the ancestors.
2.11.1	Now these five great sacrifices, they are the same as the great rites, namely, the sacrifice to the gods, the sacrifice to ancestors, the sacrifice to spirits, the sacrifice to men, and the sacrifice to Brahman.
2.11.2	One should offer oblations every day until the wood is exhausted. Thus one completes this sacrifice to the gods.
2.11.3	One should make offerings of water every day until the water vessel is empty. Thus one completes the sacrifice to the ancestors.
2.11.4	He should offer salutations every day until the flowers are exhausted. Thus he accomplishes this sacrifice to the elements.
2.11.5	He should give food every day to Brahmins until he has roots, fruits, and vegetables. Thus he accompishes this human sacrifice.
2.11.6	He should study every day until the Pranava (Om). Thus he accomplishes the sacrifice to Brahma.
2.11.7	The study of the Veda is the Brahman-sacrifice. The Brahman-sacrifice has the tongue as the ladle, the mind as the Upabṛt, the eye as the Dhruva, the intellect as the Sruva, truth as the Avabhrtha, heaven as the rising. He who gives as much wealth as this world, conquers heaven. He who knows this and studies the Veda conquers a world as much as this, and an imperishable world, and conquers death again. Therefore, one should study the Veda. Thus it is said in the Brahmana.
2.9.14	Oṃ, I offer libations to the sages. Oṃ, I make offerings to the great sages. Oṃ I offer libations the supreme sages. Oṃ. I offer libations. to the Brahma sages. Oṃ to the celestial sages.

2.11.8	Now they also quote: "He who is anointed, well-fed, lying on a comfortable bed, studies whatever rite, by that he is gratified."
2.11.9	Now they say that this Dharma has four kinds of division, because of the unseen. What are the four? This is a statement about action.
2.11.10	Aistika, Paashuka, Saumika, Darvihoma
2.11.11	This is what she says: "Those who are the four paths of the gods, extending between heaven and earth, to them who have brought the most excellent life, may the gods grant us all here."
2.11.12	Brahmachari, householder, forest-dweller, and wandering ascetic.
2.11.13	The Brahmachari, by serving his teacher until death.
2.11.14	The Vanaprastha stage is the observance of the rules of the Vaikhānasas.
2.10.1	Then, facing east, he offers water to the ancestors with the words, "Om, I offer water to the ancestors, Svāhā, salutations." "Om, I now offer water to the grandfathers, Svāhā." "Om, now I offer water to great-grandfathers, Svāhã." "Om, to the mothers, Svāhā" "Om, to grandmothers, Svāhā" "Om, to great-grandmothers, Svāhã" "Om, I pay homage to the maternal grandfathers, Svāhà" "Om, now to the great-grandfathers of the mother, Svāhā." "Om, to maternal great-great-grandfathers, Svaha." "Om, homage to the maternal great-grandmothers." "Om, Svāhā to the grandmothers of the mother." "Om, Svaha to the great-great-grandmother of the mother."
2.11.15	The Vaikhānasas, living in the forest, subsisting on roots and fruits, devoted to austerities, touching water in the sacrificial fires, worshipping gods, ancestors, spirits, men, and sages, being a guest to all, eating alms, avoiding what is forbidden, should not dwell in a village ploughed with a plough, nor enter a village. Having matted hair, wearing bark and antelope skin, he should not eat more than a year.
2.11.16	The wandering ascetic, having renounced his relatives and possessions, should go forth in accordance with the prescribed manner.
2.11.17	Having gone to the forest,
2.11.18	he should shave his head and beard.
2.11.19	He should wear a single cloth covering.
2.11.20	He should stay in one place during the rainy season.
2.11.21	He should be dressed in saffron robes.
2.11.22	He should beg for alms when the pestle is put down, the fire is extinguished, and the pot has been returned.
2.11.23	He should not harm beings with his speech, mind, or actions.
2.10.2	Oṃ, I offer libations to the teachers, Svāhā, salutations. Oṃ, I make offerings to the wives of the teachers, Svāhâ, salutations. Oṃ, I offer oblations to the preceptors, Svāhā salutations.

Oṁ, make offerings to wives of ministers, Svāha salutetions. Oṅ, make offerings to all, Svāhā. Oṁ,make offerings to all, Svaha.
2.11.24	Holding the sacred thread for the purpose of purity.
2.11.25	Performing the water ritual with water that has been drawn and purified.
2.11.26	Rejecting Vedic rituals, they say, "Let us unite the middle stage, which is enclosed on both sides."
2.11.27	The teachers say that the one-stage (life) is the only one, because the others are not generative.
2.10.3	He sprinkles water around the Tīrtha.
2.10.4	"The waters flowing with nourishment, nectar, ghee, milk, and juice, may it be Svāhā. Satisfy my ancestors. May they be satisfied, may they be satisfied, they are satisfied."
2.10.5	One should not perform the rites of the gods wearing only one garment or wet garments.
2.10.6	Some say that these rites are connected with the ancestors.
2.11.28	There they quote: Prahlada, the demon named Kapila, having become jealous of the gods, created these distinctions. The wise man should not pay attention to them.
2.11.29	Because they are unseen, the four are mentioned in the Veda, namely, the Iṣṭika, Pāśuka, Saumika, and Dārvīhoma.
2.11.30	This is what is said: This is the eternal glory of the Brahman, it does not increase by action, nor does it diminish. He who knows that Self, knowing him, one is not stained by sinful action.
2.11.1	Now these five great sacrifices, they are the same as the great rites, namely, the sacrifice to the gods, the sacrifice to ancestors, the sacrifice to spirits, the sacrifice to men, and the sacrifice to Brahman.
2.11.2	One should offer oblations every day until the wood is exhausted. Thus one completes this sacrifice to the gods.
2.11.3	One should make offerings of water every day until the water vessel is empty. Thus one completes the sacrifice to the ancestors.
2.11.4	He should offer salutations every day until the flowers are exhausted. Thus he accomplishes this sacrifice to the elements.
2.11.5	He should give food every day to Brahmins until he has roots, fruits, and vegetables. Thus he accompishes this human sacrifice.
2.11.6	He should study every day until the Pranava (Om). Thus he accomplishes the sacrifice to Brahma.
2.11.33	May I attain immortality with the progeny, O Agni. The Brāhmaṇa, when born, is indebted to three: to the sages by the study of the Vedas, to the gods by sacrifice, and to the ancestors by progeny. Thus those who speak of the union of debt have innumerable statements.
2.11.7	The study of the Veda is the Brahman-sacrifice. The Brahman-sacrifice has the tongue as the ladle, the mind as the Upabṛt, the eye as the Dhruva, the intellect as the Sruva, truth as the Avabhrtha, heaven as the rising. He who gives as much wealth as this world, conquers heaven. He who knows this and studies the Veda conquers a world as much as this, and an imperishable world, and conquers death again. Therefore, one should study the Veda. Thus it is said in the Brahmana.
2.11.34	The three Vedas, celibacy, progeny, faith, penance, sacrifice, and giving, those who perform these, with them I am one.
2.12.1	Now we shall explain the Pranahuti of the Self-sacrificers, the Shalina and Yayavara.
2.12.2	When all the necessary things are at hand, one should sit facing east in a place that is well-swept and smeared with cow-dung, and recite the mantra "Bhūr Bhuvah Suvar Om" while standing up. Then one should restrain speech.
2.11.8	Now they also quote: "He who is anointed, well-fed, lying on a comfortable bed, studies whatever rite, by that he is gratified."
2.11.9	Now they say that this Dharma has four kinds of division, because of the unseen. What are the four? This is a statement about action.
2.11.10	Aistika, Paashuka, Saumika, Darvihoma
2.11.11	This is what she says: "Those who are the four paths of the gods, extending between heaven and earth, to them who have brought the most excellent life, may the gods grant us all here."
2.11.12	Brahmachari, householder, forest-dweller, and wandering ascetic.
2.11.13	The Brahmachari, by serving his teacher until death.
2.11.14	The Vanaprastha stage is the observance of the rules of the Vaikhānasas.
2.12.3	Having placed the food, he sprinkles water clockwise, while releasing it with his left hand, saying, "You are the covering of nectar." Having drunk water in front, he offers five oblations to the life-force with the five kinds of food: "I offer the nectar that is established in the life-force, may it enter me for protection. To the life-force Svāhā." "I offer the nectars that are established in the out-breath, may they enter me for protection." To the out-breath Svāhā. "I offer the necctars that are estabished in the cross-breath, may it enter ne for protection." To cross-breath Svāha. "I offer nectars that is established in upward-breath, mayit enter me for protection" To upward-breath Svāhà. "I offer nectar that is established the equalizing breath, may it enter for protection." To equalizing breath Svāhā.
2.11.15	The Vaikhānasas, living in the forest, subsisting on roots and fruits, devoted to austerities, touching water in the sacrificial fires, worshipping gods, ancestors, spirits, men, and sages, being a guest to all, eating alms, avoiding what is forbidden, should not dwell in a village ploughed with a plough, nor enter a village. Having matted hair, wearing bark and antelope skin, he should not eat more than a year.
2.12.4	Having offered the five oblations to the life-force, one should remain silent and again take the vow, meditating on Prajapati in the mind, and not utter any words in between.
2.12.5	If one utters any words in between, one should recite "Bhūr Bhuvah Suvar Om" and then eat again.
2.12.6	Seeing the skin, hair, nails, insects, and excrement in that place, one should take the alms, sprinkle it with water, scatter ashes, sprinkle it again with water, and use it after praising it with words.
2.11.16	The wandering ascetic, having renounced his relatives and possessions, should go forth in accordance with the prescribed manner.
2.11.17	Having gone to the forest,
2.11.18	he should shave his head and beard.
2.11.19	He should wear a single cloth covering.
2.11.20	He should stay in one place during the rainy season.
2.11.21	He should be dressed in saffron robes.
2.11.22	He should beg for alms when the pestle is put down, the fire is extinguished, and the pot has been returned.
2.11.23	He should not harm beings with his speech, mind, or actions.
2.12.7	But they also quote: "One should eat while seated, facing east, with restraint of speech, without disparaging the food, without making a sound, with mind on it, and after eating, one should touch fire."
2.12.8	One should not chew all kinds of food, cakes, roots, fruits, and meat with teeth.
2.12.9	One should not eat too much.
2.11.24	Holding the sacred thread for the purpose of purity.
2.11.25	Performing the water ritual with water that has been drawn and purified.
2.11.26	Rejecting Vedic rituals, they say, "Let us unite the middle stage, which is enclosed on both sides."
2.11.27	The teachers say that the one-stage (life) is the only one, because the others are not generative.
2.12.10	"Thou art the covering of immortality." Having drunk water and sipped it, he touches the region of the heart, saying, "Thou art the knot of the vital airs, Rudra, the destroyer, may not enter thee. May I be nourished with that food."
2.11.28	There they quote: Prahlada, the demon named Kapila, having become jealous of the gods, created these distinctions. The wise man should not pay attention to them.
2.11.29	Because they are unseen, the four are mentioned in the Veda, namely, the Iṣṭika, Pāśuka, Saumika, and Dārvīhoma.
2.12.11	Again performing the Ācamana, he places his hands on the big toe of the right foot. The person is the size of a thumb and is based on the thumb. The Lord of the entire universe, the Supreme Lord, pleases the one who enjoys the universe.
2.11.30	This is what is said: This is the eternal glory of the Brahman, it does not increase by action, nor does it diminish. He who knows that Self, knowing him, one is not stained by sinful action.
2.11.31	He should say, "He who shines with the sun, the father with the son, the father-like, in the womb, the one who knows not the Veda, the great one, the all-pervading Self, the supreme."
2.11.32	"Those who do not move beyond or within, who are not Brahmins, who do not beget sons, they, having resorted to evil speech, create a system of deceit, without knowing."
2.11.33	May I attain immortality with the progeny, O Agni. The Brāhmaṇa, when born, is indebted to three: to the sages by the study of the Vedas, to the gods by sacrifice, and to the ancestors by progeny. Thus those who speak of the union of debt have innumerable statements.
2.12.13	"The Self is Brahman, for immortality."
2.12.14	One should unite the Self with the Imperishable.
2.12.15	Among those who sacrifice in all sacrifices, the Self-sacrificer is superior.
2.12.16	And they also say:
2.13.1	Just as cotton wool burns when thrown into fire, so do all sins burn for the Self-sacrificing one.
2.11.34	The three Vedas, celibacy, progeny, faith, penance, sacrifice, and giving, those who perform these, with them I am one.
2.12.1	Now we shall explain the Pranahuti of the Self-sacrificers, the Shalina and Yayavara.
2.13.2	He becomes a mere skeleton, and his food is in vain, for he is not wise.
2.13.3	He should offer oblations like this every day, in the evening and morning.
2.13.4	Or with water in the evening.
2.13.5	They also say: One should first feed guests, then pregnant women, then children, the elderly, the poor, and the sick, especially.
2.12.2	When all the necessary things are at hand, one should sit facing east in a place that is well-swept and smeared with cow-dung, and recite the mantra "Bhūr Bhuvah Suvar Om" while standing up. Then one should restrain speech.
2.13.6	But he who eats before giving to these, as prescribed, does not know what is being eaten, and he is not eaten; he is eaten.
2.13.7	One should eat the food with restraint, after giving to one's father, one's mother, one's preceptor, one's paternal uncle, one's maternal uncle, one' s wife, one's son, one's servant, one's guest, one's deity, and one's ancestors. Thus is Dharma prescribed.
2.13.8	But they also quote: The sage eats eight morsels, the forest-dweller sixteen, the householder thirty-two, the celibate unlimited.
2.13.9	The three, the householder, the celibate, and the one who has established the sacred fire, succeed by eating, not by not eating.
2.12.3	Having placed the food, he sprinkles water clockwise, while releasing it with his left hand, saying, "You are the covering of nectar." Having drunk water in front, he offers five oblations to the life-force with the five kinds of food: "I offer the nectar that is established in the life-force, may it enter me for protection. To the life-force Svāhā." "I offer the nectars that are established in the out-breath, may they enter me for protection." To the out-breath Svāhā. "I offer the necctars that are estabished in the cross-breath, may it enter ne for protection." To cross-breath Svāha. "I offer nectars that is established in upward-breath, mayit enter me for protection" To upward-breath Svāhà. "I offer nectar that is established the equalizing breath, may it enter for protection." To equalizing breath Svāhā.
2.13.10	One who is a householder or a celibate, who performs austerities without eating, commits the sin of omitting the Agnihotra of the breath. He becomes an outcast.
2.13.11	Except for expiation, the same procedure applies to expiation.
2.13.12	And they also say: One who fasts between breakfast and dinner, and who never eats, is always fasting.
2.12.4	Having offered the five oblations to the life-force, one should remain silent and again take the vow, meditating on Prajapati in the mind, and not utter any words in between.
2.12.5	If one utters any words in between, one should recite "Bhūr Bhuvah Suvar Om" and then eat again.
2.12.6	Seeing the skin, hair, nails, insects, and excrement in that place, one should take the alms, sprinkle it with water, scatter ashes, sprinkle it again with water, and use it after praising it with words.
2.14.2	Trimadhu, Trinaciketasa, Trisuparna, Pancagni, Sadanga, Visheshaka, Jyesthasamaka, Snataka - these are the purifiers of the row.
2.14.3	In their absence, one who knows the secrets.
2.14.4	The greatness of the Sraddha is that it consists of the Ricas, Yajusas and Samanas. Therefore, one should offer the food to one who knows this, even if he is a Sapiṇḍa.
2.12.7	But they also quote: "One should eat while seated, facing east, with restraint of speech, without disparaging the food, without making a sound, with mind on it, and after eating, one should touch fire."
2.12.8	One should not chew all kinds of food, cakes, roots, fruits, and meat with teeth.
2.12.9	One should not eat too much.
2.14.5	The mantras that are destructive of demons, the mantras that are self-sufficient, the mantras of the Atharva Veda, the honey verses, and the purifying mantras should be recited slowly and with concentration.
2.12.10	"Thou art the covering of immortality." Having drunk water and sipped it, he touches the region of the heart, saying, "Thou art the knot of the vital airs, Rudra, the destroyer, may not enter thee. May I be nourished with that food."
2.14.6	The Brahmins who are invited should be those who are well-versed in the Vedas, have good conduct, are born in good families, are well-versed, pure, and have good mantras. They should be invited on the previous day or in the morning. They should be seated facing east or north on seats covered with Darbha grass.
2.12.11	Again performing the Ācamana, he places his hands on the big toe of the right foot. The person is the size of a thumb and is based on the thumb. The Lord of the entire universe, the Supreme Lord, pleases the one who enjoys the universe.
2.14.7	Then having received the water mixed with sesamum, and having adorned them with perfumes and garlands, and having been permitted to say "I shall perform the rite in the fire", having kindled the fire, having strewn it around, having made the offerings of food at the mouth of the fire, he offers three oblations to Soma, the drinker of the dead, Svāhā, to Yama, the son of Angiras, the father of the dead, svāhā, to Agni, the carrier of oblations, the performer of the well-offered, svāhā.
2.12.12	The offering of oblations should be done with the right hand raised, with the mind fixed in faith. The oblation is offered in the life-force, the life-force is nourished by food. The oblation should be offered in the out-breath, the life-breath is nourished by food, the oblation should be made in the up-breath, the out-breath is nourished with food, the obolation should be made in all-pervading breath, the up-breath is nourished in food, the obilation should be made in equalizing breath, the all-pervding breath is nourished in food. Thus with five verses.
2.14.8	With the remaining portion of the oblation, he should pour over the food and offer these three oblations.
2.14.9	He should give a ball of food to the departed ancestors.
2.14.10	It is known that the departed ancestors move in the form of their children.
2.14.11	Then he touches it with the thumb of his hand.
2.12.13	"The Self is Brahman, for immortality."
2.12.14	One should unite the Self with the Imperishable.
2.12.15	Among those who sacrifice in all sacrifices, the Self-sacrificer is superior.
2.12.16	And they also say:
2.13.1	Just as cotton wool burns when thrown into fire, so do all sins burn for the Self-sacrificing one.
2.13.2	He becomes a mere skeleton, and his food is in vain, for he is not wise.
2.13.3	He should offer oblations like this every day, in the evening and morning.
2.13.4	Or with water in the evening.
2.13.5	They also say: One should first feed guests, then pregnant women, then children, the elderly, the poor, and the sick, especially.
2.14.12	Your Agni is the guardian of the earth. Your glory is the gift. For the sake of non-negligence, the earth is your vessel, the sky is your cover. I offer you into the mouth of Brahman. I offer you to the learned Brahmanas. I offer you in the inhalations and exhalations. You are the imperishable. You are the best of the ancestors. Here and in the other world. Your Vayu is the listener of the sky. Your glory is Yajus. For the sake... Your Adityas are the proclaimers of the sky. You are the glory of the Sama. For the sake ... The earth is your vessel. The sky is your cover.
2.15.1	Now, indeed, it is said:
2.15.2	If the fire is left over after the performance, one should pour that food over it. But if it is given without the thumb, it does not please the ancestors.
2.15.3	The food offered to the ancestors is released from both branches. The Asuras with evil intentions approach that.
2.13.6	But he who eats before giving to these, as prescribed, does not know what is being eaten, and he is not eaten; he is eaten.
2.13.7	One should eat the food with restraint, after giving to one's father, one's mother, one's preceptor, one's paternal uncle, one's maternal uncle, one' s wife, one's son, one's servant, one's guest, one's deity, and one's ancestors. Thus is Dharma prescribed.
2.15.4	The demons and pisācas steal that oblation. For those who give sesame, the Asuras are under the control of anger.
2.15.5	He who performs muttering, sacrifice, and acceptance of gifts while wearing a saffron robe, that oblation does not reach the gods in the offerings.
2.13.8	But they also quote: The sage eats eight morsels, the forest-dweller sixteen, the householder thirty-two, the celibate unlimited.
2.13.9	The three, the householder, the celibate, and the one who has established the sacred fire, succeed by eating, not by not eating.
2.15.6	And what is given without the thumb, and what is received, and what is eaten while standing, that does not prosper.
2.15.7	The offering of water at the beginning and end is everywhere.
2.15.8	Victory and others as per prescribed rules.
2.15.9	The rest is mentioned in the Ashtakahoma.
2.15.10	One should feed two in the case of divine rites, three in the case of ancestral rites, or one in both, even if very prosperous, one should not indulge in elaboration.
2.13.10	One who is a householder or a celibate, who performs austerities without eating, commits the sin of omitting the Agnihotra of the breath. He becomes an outcast.
2.13.11	Except for expiation, the same procedure applies to expiation.
2.13.12	And they also say: One who fasts between breakfast and dinner, and who never eats, is always fasting.
2.15.11	Respect, place, time, purity, and the prosperity of the Brahmins - these five are destroyed by details. Therefore, one should avoid them.
2.15.12	His father is on his chest, grandfather on his left, great-grandfather on his right, and the ancestors who offer balls of rice are behind.
2.16.1	Instruction for those desiring offspring.
2.16.2	The Ashvins said: The name is given for the purpose of procreation.
2.16.3	One who is endowed with life, austerities, and study, and is devoted to sacrifice, should beget offspring in accordance with his own caste, having conquered his senses.
2.16.4	The union of a Brahmin with a woman of another caste occurs in three ways: by birth, by the woman's own choice, or by the woman' s own choice. One who is self-controlled becomes free from these, and is liberated from doubts about Dharma.
2.14.2	Trimadhu, Trinaciketasa, Trisuparna, Pancagni, Sadanga, Visheshaka, Jyesthasamaka, Snataka - these are the purifiers of the row.
2.14.3	In their absence, one who knows the secrets.
2.14.4	The greatness of the Sraddha is that it consists of the Ricas, Yajusas and Samanas. Therefore, one should offer the food to one who knows this, even if he is a Sapiṇḍa.
2.14.5	The mantras that are destructive of demons, the mantras that are self-sufficient, the mantras of the Atharva Veda, the honey verses, and the purifying mantras should be recited slowly and with concentration.
2.14.6	The Brahmins who are invited should be those who are well-versed in the Vedas, have good conduct, are born in good families, are well-versed, pure, and have good mantras. They should be invited on the previous day or in the morning. They should be seated facing east or north on seats covered with Darbha grass.
2.16.9	He obtains a good son, who saves him from the seven ancestors, the seven descendants, and the six others, including himself.
2.16.10	Therefore, having produced the continuity of offspring, one attains the fruit.
2.16.11	Therefore, one should exert oneself in producing offspring.
2.16.12	By the combination of herbs and mantras.
2.16.13	Its instruction is taught by the commonality of hearing.
2.14.7	Then having received the water mixed with sesamum, and having adorned them with perfumes and garlands, and having been permitted to say "I shall perform the rite in the fire", having kindled the fire, having strewn it around, having made the offerings of food at the mouth of the fire, he offers three oblations to Soma, the drinker of the dead, Svāhā, to Yama, the son of Angiras, the father of the dead, svāhā, to Agni, the carrier of oblations, the performer of the well-offered, svāhā.
2.16.14	Because of the fruitfulness of all castes. Because of fruitfulness.
2.17.1	Now, we shall explain the method of renunciation.
2.17.2	Some say that one who is already a student renounces.
2.17.3	Then, those who are virtuous, unmarried, and childless.
2.17.4	Or one who is widowed, or one who has established his offspring in their own duty.
2.17.5	They teach renunciation after seventy years.
2.14.8	With the remaining portion of the oblation, he should pour over the food and offer these three oblations.
2.14.9	He should give a ball of food to the departed ancestors.
2.14.10	It is known that the departed ancestors move in the form of their children.
2.14.11	Then he touches it with the thumb of his hand.
2.17.6	Or, of the forest-dweller, at the cessation of his duties.
2.17.7	This is the eternal glory of the Brahman, he does not increase by action, nor does he diminish. He who knows that Self, the knower of the path, is not stained by sinful action.
2.17.8	It leads to non-rebirth, hence it is eternal.
2.17.9	It leads him to the great, hence it is glory.
2.17.10	Having shaved the head, beard, hair, and nails, one should prepare oneself.
2.17.11	The staff, the sling, the water-purifier, the water-pot, and the vessel.
2.17.12	Taking these, he should fast at the end of the village, at the boundary of the village, in the fire-house, having eaten the three-fold oblation of ghee, milk, and curd.
2.17.13	Or water.
2.14.12	Your Agni is the guardian of the earth. Your glory is the gift. For the sake of non-negligence, the earth is your vessel, the sky is your cover. I offer you into the mouth of Brahman. I offer you to the learned Brahmanas. I offer you in the inhalations and exhalations. You are the imperishable. You are the best of the ancestors. Here and in the other world. Your Vayu is the listener of the sky. Your glory is Yajus. For the sake... Your Adityas are the proclaimers of the sky. You are the glory of the Sama. For the sake ... The earth is your vessel. The sky is your cover.
2.15.1	Now, indeed, it is said:
2.15.2	If the fire is left over after the performance, one should pour that food over it. But if it is given without the thumb, it does not please the ancestors.
2.15.3	The food offered to the ancestors is released from both branches. The Asuras with evil intentions approach that.
2.15.4	The demons and pisācas steal that oblation. For those who give sesame, the Asuras are under the control of anger.
2.15.5	He who performs muttering, sacrifice, and acceptance of gifts while wearing a saffron robe, that oblation does not reach the gods in the offerings.
2.15.6	And what is given without the thumb, and what is received, and what is eaten while standing, that does not prosper.
2.15.7	The offering of water at the beginning and end is everywhere.
2.15.8	Victory and others as per prescribed rules.
2.15.9	The rest is mentioned in the Ashtakahoma.
2.15.10	One should feed two in the case of divine rites, three in the case of ancestral rites, or one in both, even if very prosperous, one should not indulge in elaboration.
2.17.14	Oṃ bhūḥ, I enter Savitri. Oṃ bhūh, I enter Savitari. Oṃ bhuvah, I enter Savitry. Oṃ bhuh, I enter Savitrī. Oṃ suvah, I enter the Savitri. Omeditate on the radiance of the divine. Oṃ suvaḥ, I enter the savitri. Oṃ suvar, I enter the savior. Oṃ surah, I enter the Savior. Oṃ suras, I enter the Saviour. Oṃ surad, I enter the Saver. Oṃ suram, I enter the saver. Oṃ sura, I enter the savor. Oṃ suri, I enter the savory. Oṃ sur, I enter the sur. Oṃ su, I enter the su. Oṃ sukh, I enter the sukha. Oṃ sukha, I enter the Sukha. Oṃ sukha, I enter the Suka. Oṃ sukhi, I enter the Suki. Oṃ suk, I enter the suku. Oṃ sukk, I enter the sikk. Oṃ sikk, I enter the Sikka. Oṃ sika, I enter the Siksa. Oṃ siks, I enter the siks. Oṃ si, I enter the sa. Oṃ sa, I enter the Sa. Oṃ saṃ, I enter the Sam. Oṃ saṅga, I enter the Sangha.
2.15.11	Respect, place, time, purity, and the prosperity of the Brahmins - these five are destroyed by details. Therefore, one should avoid them.
2.15.12	His father is on his chest, grandfather on his left, great-grandfather on his right, and the ancestors who offer balls of rice are behind.
2.16.1	Instruction for those desiring offspring.
2.16.2	The Ashvins said: The name is given for the purpose of procreation.
2.17.15	It is understood that one becomes pure by means of the Veda, having transferred oneself from one stage of life to another.
2.17.16	But they also say: "Having gone from one stage of lif to another, offering oblations, controlling the senses, exhausted by alms and offerings, one becomes a mendicant later."
2.17.17	This mendicant is for the sake of immortality.
2.16.3	One who is endowed with life, austerities, and study, and is devoted to sacrifice, should beget offspring in accordance with his own caste, having conquered his senses.
2.16.4	The union of a Brahmin with a woman of another caste occurs in three ways: by birth, by the woman's own choice, or by the woman' s own choice. One who is self-controlled becomes free from these, and is liberated from doubts about Dharma.
2.17.18	Having placed the Garhapatya fire before the setting of the sun, having brought the Anvähäryapacani fire, having taken up the blazing Ahavaniya fire, having melted the clarified butter over the Garhapaty, having taken four spoonfuls in the ladle, he offers a full oblation on the Ahavaniya fire with the Samidhs, with "Om svähä".
2.17.19	This is known as the Brahmana-Anvadhana.
2.16.5	By studying the Vedas, by worshipping the sages, by offering Soma to Indra, and by begetting offspring, one becomes free from debt and rejoices in heaven.
2.16.6	By a son one conquers the worlds, by a grandson one attains immortality, and then by the son of a grandson one ascends to heaven.
2.17.20	Then, having offered the Agnihotra in the evening, having spread grass to the north of the Garhapatya, having placed the pairs of vessels on them, having spread darbha grass in the Brahma-place to the right of the Ahavaniya, having covered the black antelope skin on them, he keeps awake during this night.
2.16.7	And the Veda shows that the relation of debt is such, when it says, “The Brāhmaṇa, when born, is born with three debts: to the Rṣis by Vedic study, to the gods by sacrifices, to the Pitṛs by begetting offspring.”
2.16.8	Having produced a good son, one saves oneself.
2.17.21	One who knows this, having fasted during the night of Brahma, having consigned the fires, and having died, crosses over all sin, crosses over the sin of Brahmahatya.
2.17.22	Then, having risen at the Brahma Muhurta, he offers the Agnihotra at the proper time in the morning.
2.17.23	Then, after spreading the sacrificial grass and offering water, he offers the Vaishvanara oblation in twelve potsherds. That well-known Iști comes to an end.
2.16.9	He obtains a good son, who saves him from the seven ancestors, the seven descendants, and the six others, including himself.
2.16.10	Therefore, having produced the continuity of offspring, one attains the fruit.
2.16.11	Therefore, one should exert oneself in producing offspring.
2.16.12	By the combination of herbs and mantras.
2.16.13	Its instruction is taught by the commonality of hearing.
2.17.24	He throws the Agnihotra vessels into the Ahavaniya fire, made of clay, not of stone.
2.17.25	The kindling woods are in the Garhapatya fire, "May they be of one mind."
2.17.26	He places the fires on himself, "That form of thine, O Agni, which is fit for sacrifice," he thrice thrice inhales each one.
2.16.14	Because of the fruitfulness of all castes. Because of fruitfulness.
2.17.1	Now, we shall explain the method of renunciation.
2.17.2	Some say that one who is already a student renounces.
2.17.3	Then, those who are virtuous, unmarried, and childless.
2.17.4	Or one who is widowed, or one who has established his offspring in their own duty.
2.17.5	They teach renunciation after seventy years.
2.17.27	Then standing within the altar, he says three times in a low voice, "I have given up, I have given up, have given up," and then three times aloud.
2.17.28	For it is known that the gods are three times as many.
2.17.29	He offers a full handful of water, saying, "May all beings be free from fear because of me."
2.17.6	Or, of the forest-dweller, at the cessation of his duties.
2.17.7	This is the eternal glory of the Brahman, he does not increase by action, nor does he diminish. He who knows that Self, the knower of the path, is not stained by sinful action.
2.17.8	It leads to non-rebirth, hence it is eternal.
2.17.9	It leads him to the great, hence it is glory.
2.17.10	Having shaved the head, beard, hair, and nails, one should prepare oneself.
2.17.30	But they also say: "Having given fearlessness to all beings, the sage who wanders, for him no fear from all beings arises here."
2.17.31	He becomes silent.
2.17.32	He takes the staff, saying, "Protect me, O friend."
2.17.33	He takes the sling, saying, "What is beyond the dust."
2.17.34	He takes water for purification, saying, "By which the gods are purified."
2.17.35	With the verse, "By whom the gods went upwards to the light," he takes up the water-pot.
2.17.36	He takes up the vessel with the seven Vyāhṛtis.
2.17.11	The staff, the sling, the water-purifier, the water-pot, and the vessel.
2.17.12	Taking these, he should fast at the end of the village, at the boundary of the village, in the fire-house, having eaten the three-fold oblation of ghee, milk, and curd.
2.17.13	Or water.
2.17.37	Taking the staff, the water-purifier, the water-pot, and the vessel, he goes to the place where there is water, bathes, sips water, and purifies himself with the verses "Surbhimatī," "Ablinga," "Varuṇī," "Hiranyavarṇā," and "Pāvamānī." Having purified himself, he enters the water and performs the sixteen Prāṇāyāmas while reciting the "Aghmarṣaṇa" mantra. Emerging, he presses his garment, puts on another clean garment, sips water again, and takes the water-purified with "Om Bhūr Bhuvah Suvar." He offers libations with "Om Bhūḥ, I offer libations. Om Bhuvah, I offer libatious. Om Suvar, I offer libation. Om Mah, I offer libatiou. Om Jan, I offer libatian. Om Tap, I offer libatien. Om Satya, I offer libatians."
2.17.38	Having offered libations to the gods and ancestors, he offers libations to the sun with the verses, "Om, Bhu, Svāhā. Om, Bhuva, Svāhā." "Om, Suva, Svāha. Om, Bhu, Bhuva, Suva, Mah, Namah."
2.17.39	Then he worships the sun with the two verses, "Ud utyaṃ citraṃ" and "Ud utyaḥ."
2.17.15	It is understood that one becomes pure by means of the Veda, having transferred oneself from one stage of life to another.
2.17.16	But they also say: "Having gone from one stage of lif to another, offering oblations, controlling the senses, exhausted by alms and offerings, one becomes a mendicant later."
2.17.17	This mendicant is for the sake of immortality.
2.17.40	"Om, this is Brahman. This is the light, this is the Veda, this is the one who shines. This is the Veda, the one who shines is the Veda. Thus he satisfies himself and pays homage to himself. The Self is Brahman, the Self is the light."
2.17.41	One should recite the Savitri verse a thousand times, or a hundred times, or an unlimited number of times.
2.17.42	"Oṃ bhūr bhuvaḥ suvaḥ." Taking the water sanctifier, one takes water.
2.17.43	One should not take water that is not lifted up, not flowing, or not purified.
2.17.44	One should also not wear white clothes above this.
2.18.1	One should have either one staff or three staffs.
2.17.18	Having placed the Garhapatya fire before the setting of the sun, having brought the Anvähäryapacani fire, having taken up the blazing Ahavaniya fire, having melted the clarified butter over the Garhapaty, having taken four spoonfuls in the ladle, he offers a full oblation on the Ahavaniya fire with the Samidhs, with "Om svähä".
2.17.19	This is known as the Brahmana-Anvadhana.
2.18.2	Now these are the vows: Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, and abstention from sexual intercourse, and renunciation.
2.18.3	There are five subsidiary vows: Non-anger, service to the elders, diligence, cleanliness, and purity of diet.
2.18.4	Then, after the Vaishvadeva offering, the wandering mendicant Brahmins should seek alms with humility.
2.17.20	Then, having offered the Agnihotra in the evening, having spread grass to the north of the Garhapatya, having placed the pairs of vessels on them, having spread darbha grass in the Brahma-place to the right of the Ahavaniya, having covered the black antelope skin on them, he keeps awake during this night.
2.18.5	He should recite the verse beginning with "Obeisance to the Supreme Being" and ending with "May you be pleased with me."
2.18.6	He should desire to beg for alms for the duration of a cow's milking.
2.18.7	Then, having returned from begging alms, placing his hands and feet in a clean place, washing them, he should offer salutations in front of the sun, reciting the verse "Obeisance, Obeisance to the Sun, the Supreme Being" (Udu tyam citram) and "Obeisance is offered to the Supreme Being, the Creator" (Brahma jjananam).
2.17.21	One who knows this, having fasted during the night of Brahma, having consigned the fires, and having died, crosses over all sin, crosses over the sin of Brahmahatya.
2.17.22	Then, having risen at the Brahma Muhurta, he offers the Agnihotra at the proper time in the morning.
2.17.23	Then, after spreading the sacrificial grass and offering water, he offers the Vaishvanara oblation in twelve potsherds. That well-known Iști comes to an end.
2.17.24	He throws the Agnihotra vessels into the Ahavaniya fire, made of clay, not of stone.
2.17.25	The kindling woods are in the Garhapatya fire, "May they be of one mind."
2.17.26	He places the fires on himself, "That form of thine, O Agni, which is fit for sacrifice," he thrice thrice inhales each one.
2.18.8	It is known that the sacrificer himself becomes the fires beginning with the Ādhāna. His Prāṇa is the Garhapatya, Apāna the Anvāhāryapacaniya, Vyāna the Āhavanīya, Udāna and Samāna the Sabhya and Avāsathya. These five fires are in the Self. He offers in the Self.
2.18.9	It is known that this is the Self-sacrifice, the Self-fulfillment, the Self-establishment, which leads the Self to safety.
2.17.27	Then standing within the altar, he says three times in a low voice, "I have given up, I have given up, have given up," and then three times aloud.
2.17.28	For it is known that the gods are three times as many.
2.17.29	He offers a full handful of water, saying, "May all beings be free from fear because of me."
2.18.10	Having distributed the remainder to the spirits with compassion, he should eat it, touching it with water like medicine.
2.18.11	Having eaten and sipped water, he stands facing the sun with the Jyotishmatī mantra, reciting "We rise from the darkness" and "Speech is my nose, breath is my mouth".
2.17.30	But they also say: "Having given fearlessness to all beings, the sage who wanders, for him no fear from all beings arises here."
2.17.31	He becomes silent.
2.17.32	He takes the staff, saying, "Protect me, O friend."
2.17.33	He takes the sling, saying, "What is beyond the dust."
2.17.34	He takes water for purification, saying, "By which the gods are purified."
2.17.35	With the verse, "By whom the gods went upwards to the light," he takes up the water-pot.
2.17.36	He takes up the vessel with the seven Vyāhṛtis.
2.18.12-13	He should eat only what is given to him, not what he has asked for; he should eat only what he has received, not what he himself has stored up; he should eat at the proper time, not at the wrong time; he should eat what is suitable, not what is unsuitable; he should eat in moderation, not in excess; he should eat for the sake of maintaining his body, not for the sake of pleasure; he should eat with the intention of maintaining his body and not for the sake of pleasure; he should not eat for the sake  Translation: He should eat only as much as is given to him and not what he has requested for; he should only eat what is received and not what he himself stores up; he should only at the proper time and not at the wrong; he should only what is suitable and not what is unsuitable. He should only eat in moderation and not in excess; only for the sake of sustaining his body and not to please his palate; only for the purpose of maintaining his body. He should not eat for
2.18.14	Or alms from all castes, or one meal from twice-born people, or from all castes, but not one meal from twice born people.
2.18.15	Then, where the teachers speak of the Upanisads, they quote: "The observance of silence, the heroic posture, the bathing at the places of sacrifice, the observance of the fasts at the fourth, sixth, and eighth times, and the observance of the diet of barley, sesame, wheat, curd, and milk."
2.17.37	Taking the staff, the water-purifier, the water-pot, and the vessel, he goes to the place where there is water, bathes, sips water, and purifies himself with the verses "Surbhimatī," "Ablinga," "Varuṇī," "Hiranyavarṇā," and "Pāvamānī." Having purified himself, he enters the water and performs the sixteen Prāṇāyāmas while reciting the "Aghmarṣaṇa" mantra. Emerging, he presses his garment, puts on another clean garment, sips water again, and takes the water-purified with "Om Bhūr Bhuvah Suvar." He offers libations with "Om Bhūḥ, I offer libations. Om Bhuvah, I offer libatious. Om Suvar, I offer libation. Om Mah, I offer libatiou. Om Jan, I offer libatian. Om Tap, I offer libatien. Om Satya, I offer libatians."
2.18.16	There, one should be silent, or with the elders of the three Vedas, or with other sages, or with the ascetics, or with the learned, or with the teeth touching the teeth, speaking only as much as is necessary, not with women, where it is known that there is no loss.
2.18.17	One should practice either the posture of silence, heroism, or sitting, but not all three together.
2.17.38	Having offered libations to the gods and ancestors, he offers libations to the sun with the verses, "Om, Bhu, Svāhā. Om, Bhuva, Svāhā." "Om, Suva, Svāha. Om, Bhu, Bhuva, Suva, Mah, Namah."
2.17.39	Then he worships the sun with the two verses, "Ud utyaṃ citraṃ" and "Ud utyaḥ."
2.18.18	Where one goes and how much one follows, it is known that there is no loss in that.
2.18.19	For one who is engaged in the vow of silence, heroic posture, bathing, and the fourth, sixth, and eighth mealtimes, there are eight things that destroy vows: water, roots, ghee, milk, oblations, what is desired by Brahmins, the words of the Guru, and medicine.
2.17.40	"Om, this is Brahman. This is the light, this is the Veda, this is the one who shines. This is the Veda, the one who shines is the Veda. Thus he satisfies himself and pays homage to himself. The Self is Brahman, the Self is the light."
2.17.41	One should recite the Savitri verse a thousand times, or a hundred times, or an unlimited number of times.
2.18.20	In the evening and morning, one should recite the Agnihotra mantras.
2.18.21	Having performed the evening twilight with the Varuni mantras, one should perform the morning twilight with the Maitri mantras.
2.18.22	One should be without fire, without a dwelling, a sage without shelter or refuge, seeking alms in the village, or one should abandon speech in the study of the Vedas.
2.17.42	"Oṃ bhūr bhuvaḥ suvaḥ." Taking the water sanctifier, one takes water.
2.17.43	One should not take water that is not lifted up, not flowing, or not purified.
2.17.44	One should also not wear white clothes above this.
2.18.1	One should have either one staff or three staffs.
2.18.2	Now these are the vows: Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, and abstention from sexual intercourse, and renunciation.
2.18.3	There are five subsidiary vows: Non-anger, service to the elders, diligence, cleanliness, and purity of diet.

3.8.25	Having offered to the constellation Abhijit, one should give a cow to the Brahmins.

3.9.18	This is called the "way of the gods".
4.1.12	If a man does not give his marriageable daughter in marriage for three years, he undoubtedly incurs the same sin as that of killing a foetus.
4.1.13	If he does not ask for her, it would be so; if he asks for her separately, Manu has said that the sin of each month is a sin.
3.9.19	By this very sacrifice the gods attained divinity, the sages attained sagehood.

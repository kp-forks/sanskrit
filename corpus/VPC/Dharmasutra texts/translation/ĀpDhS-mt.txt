1.1.14	The one from whom one acquires knowledge is the teacher.

1.5.1	In the case of restraints, the word 'tapas' is used.
1.5.2	If one transgresses them, knowledge and action flow out from this Brahma along with its offspring.

1.11.17	And when one is immersed in water.
1.11.18	At night, when it is uncovered.
1.11.19	And during the day, when it is covered.
1.11.20	The recitation of the Anuvāka is not prescribed in Āṣāḍha and Vasanta.
1.11.31	The shadow of the sun and the moon, the rainbow, the shadow of the sun, the shadow of a fish, and the wind, the smell of which is bad, and the mist, all these are to be known as the time of the eclipse.
1.11.32	The wind stops for a Muhurta.
1.11.33	In the Salavrika, the one-eyed one, and in the dream, the time is the same.
1.11.34	At night, in the forest, without fire, without gold.
1.11.21	And of the eternal question, there is no rule.
1.11.22	There is a rule for that.
1.11.23	One who has not eaten the morning meal should go to the water's edge, be pure and attentive, and recite as much as he knows in a pure place, or let it go with his voice.
1.11.24	And with his mind, not in a non-study.
1.11.25	And in lightning, thunder, and famine, they say the mind is to be restrained.
1.11.26	Some say only at a śrāddha meal.
1.11.35	And what is not mentioned in the Veda, one should not study.
1.11.36	And in the evening.
1.11.37	What is mentioned as to be done at all times.
1.11.38	What is not mentioned here, one should do as prescribed in the assembly.
1.12.1	This is the Brahmanical text: Tapas and self-study.
1.12.2	There it is heard: If one studies while standing, sitting, or lying down, that is indeed austerity, for self-study is indeed austerity.
1.11.27	When lightning, thunder, rain, and clouds gather for three days, there is no study.
1.11.28	Some say that there is no study until the earth is dry.
1.11.29	There is no study for one or two days when these occur out of season.
1.11.30	When there is an eclipse of the sun or moon, an earthquake, a cry in the sky, a meteor, or a fire, there is no studying of all the sciences at all times.
1.12.3	Now, if it is said that the Vājasaneyi Brāhmaṇa is the Veda, then this is the Brahman-sacrifice, namely, the recitation of the Veda. The thunder, lightning, thunderclap, and wind are the Vasat-utterances of that sacrifice. Therefore, one should recite when there is thunder, lightning, and thunderclap, or when the wind is blowing. The Vasat-utterance is the sound of the wind.
1.11.31	The shadow of the sun and the moon, the rainbow, the shadow of the sun, the shadow of a fish, and the wind, the smell of which is bad, and the mist, all these are to be known as the time of the eclipse.
1.11.32	The wind stops for a Muhurta.
1.11.33	In the Salavrika, the one-eyed one, and in the dream, the time is the same.
1.11.34	At night, in the forest, without fire, without gold.
1.12.4	The end of the sentence is at the end of the branch.
1.12.5	Now if there is wind or thunder or lightning or a flash of lightning, he should recite the following verses: "Bhuvah, Bhuvah, Suvah, Satyam, Tapas, I offer in Sraddha." This is what he does. Thus, on that day, his study is accomplished.
1.12.6	Thus, it is not prohibited by the noble time.
1.12.7	If one were to examine the Vajasaneyi Brahmana, then it would be meaningless, since it teaches the non-study of chapters.
1.12.8	The noble time is not accepted as a reason.
1.12.9	Non-study is heard in relation to knowledge, not in relation to the union of mantras and actions.
1.11.35	And what is not mentioned in the Veda, one should not study.
1.11.36	And in the evening.
1.11.37	What is mentioned as to be done at all times.
1.11.38	What is not mentioned here, one should do as prescribed in the assembly.
1.12.1	This is the Brahmanical text: Tapas and self-study.
1.12.2	There it is heard: If one studies while standing, sitting, or lying down, that is indeed austerity, for self-study is indeed austerity.
1.12.10	The rules laid down by the Brahmanas have been lost, but their use can be inferred from the practice.
1.12.11	Where there is activity due to pleasure, there is no scripture.
1.12.12	He who follows it goes to hell.
1.12.13	Now the rules laid down by Brahmanas.
1.12.14	Their great sacrifices and great assemblies are praised.
1.12.3	Now, if it is said that the Vājasaneyi Brāhmaṇa is the Veda, then this is the Brahman-sacrifice, namely, the recitation of the Veda. The thunder, lightning, thunderclap, and wind are the Vasat-utterances of that sacrifice. Therefore, one should recite when there is thunder, lightning, and thunderclap, or when the wind is blowing. The Vasat-utterance is the sound of the wind.
1.12.15	Every day, the offering to the spirits should be given to humans according to one's ability.
1.13.1	To the gods, with the word "svāhā" from the wood; to the ancestors, with the word "svadhā" from the pot of water; and to oneself, with the word "svādhyāya"
1.13.2	Worship should be done to those of higher caste.
1.13.3	And to those who are older.
1.13.4	One who is joyful, arrogant, or haughty transgresses the Dharma. In the transgression of Dharma, there is hell.
1.12.4	The end of the sentence is at the end of the branch.
1.12.5	Now if there is wind or thunder or lightning or a flash of lightning, he should recite the following verses: "Bhuvah, Bhuvah, Suvah, Satyam, Tapas, I offer in Sraddha." This is what he does. Thus, on that day, his study is accomplished.
1.13.5	When the assembly is not concluded, there is no instruction.
1.13.6	Oṃkāra is the gate of heaven, therefore, Brahma, being requested, should understand this and other things.
1.13.7	Having engaged in some other conversation, he turns away from Brahma with worldly speech.
1.13.8	And these are the beginnings of sacrifices.
1.12.6	Thus, it is not prohibited by the noble time.
1.12.7	If one were to examine the Vajasaneyi Brahmana, then it would be meaningless, since it teaches the non-study of chapters.
1.12.8	The noble time is not accepted as a reason.
1.12.9	Non-study is heard in relation to knowledge, not in relation to the union of mantras and actions.
1.13.9	And in the world, these would be the only words for auspicious rites, such as "May there be prosperity, may there be success."
1.13.10	One should not perform austerities at an improper time. The three-fold hearing and the three-fold recitation are to be abandoned.
1.13.11	Hārīta says, "One should not doubt until one reaches Brahma."
1.13.12	There is no way outside the Vedas.
1.12.10	The rules laid down by the Brahmanas have been lost, but their use can be inferred from the practice.
1.12.11	Where there is activity due to pleasure, there is no scripture.
1.12.12	He who follows it goes to hell.
1.12.13	Now the rules laid down by Brahmanas.
1.12.14	Their great sacrifices and great assemblies are praised.
1.13.13	He should take up the study of the Veda from a teacher who has been duly appointed.
1.13.14	Some say that he should take it from one who is always an Arhant.
1.13.15	There is no rule regarding this.
1.13.16	But there is a rule for the elders.
1.13.17	There is, however, no rule regarding the appointment of a teacher in the case of the Veda.
1.13.18	They say that the Veda grows.
1.12.15	Every day, the offering to the spirits should be given to humans according to one's ability.
1.13.1	To the gods, with the word "svāhā" from the wood; to the ancestors, with the word "svadhā" from the pot of water; and to oneself, with the word "svādhyāya"
1.13.2	Worship should be done to those of higher caste.
1.13.3	And to those who are older.
1.13.4	One who is joyful, arrogant, or haughty transgresses the Dharma. In the transgression of Dharma, there is hell.
1.13.19	When the ceremony of investiture is over, one should live for two months in the teacher's house, desiring to hear more. This is said by Śvetaketu.
1.13.20	By this yoga, I have heard more than before."
1.13.21	It is contradicted by those scriptures.
1.13.22	Because when the ceremony of investitures is over, the Vedic rites are heard.
1.13.5	When the assembly is not concluded, there is no instruction.
1.13.6	Oṃkāra is the gate of heaven, therefore, Brahma, being requested, should understand this and other things.
1.13.7	Having engaged in some other conversation, he turns away from Brahma with worldly speech.
1.13.8	And these are the beginnings of sacrifices.
1.14.1	Guests are Agnihotra.
1.14.2	And whatever else is appropriate.
1.14.3	If one is urged to study by someone, one should not refuse him.

1.26.7	One should perform the rites of sprinkling with the Varuṇī mantras or with other purifying mantras, as per the practice of rites, after performing rites with intention or without intention, in the case of eating and drinking prohibited food, in the case where semen is emitted in an improper place, and in the case of activities prohibited for non-noble people.

1.25.6	Or one should enter fire or undertake severe austerities.
1.25.7	Or one should attain oneself through reducing one's food.
1.25.8	Or one may practice the Kṛcchra-Samvatsara vow.

1.28.11	Having permitted the enjoyment of wealth obtained by unrighteous means, having declared, “I am not unrighteous,” having covered the lower part of the body and the upper part of the thighs, having touched water three times, eating food without milk, salt, or oil, one should not enter a house for twelve years.
1.28.12	Then there is success.
1.28.13	Then there may be association with the noble ones.
1.27.5	One should touch water at both dusk and dawn during the winter and spring seasons.
1.27.6	One should perform the Kṛcchra-twelve-night penance.
1.27.7	One should fast for three days, then eat only at night for three days, and then observe the three-day vow of not begging for food. One does not eat anything for three days. This is the procedure for the Kṛcchrā-twelve-night.

1.28.14	This is also the case with the other crimes leading to expulsion.
1.28.15	One who has committed incest should enter a hollow bamboo tube, set fire to it at both ends, and burn himself.
1.28.16	Hariṭa says that this is wrong.
1.28.17	For one who considers himself or another as supreme is indeed condemned.
1.27.9	Then, having committed many other offences, one becomes absolved of the guilt by performing the expiatory rites of the three Parayana recitations.
1.27.10	One who has a non-Aryan woman as his wife, gives interest on money, and is a dyer, should sit on grass with his back to the sun, like a non-Brahmin who has been worshipped.
1.28.18	By this very procedure, one should wander from the best breath-control. There is no return in this world, but sin is removed.
1.28.19	One who has violated the monastic code should wear a garment made of coarse cloth and go outside wearing the hair. One should wander for alms, saying, "For one who has violated the rules." One should wander for seven nights. That is the livelihood for six months.
1.28.20	But in the case of a woman, if she transgresses against her husband, she should perform the Kṛcchra and Dvādaśāha for twelve days.
1.28.21	Now, the one who has killed a foetus should wear the skin of a dog or a jackal, or the fur of a wild animal, outside the village, carrying a human skull as a begging bowl.
1.28.3	The horses and oxen of the peace-makers do not disobey their masters.
1.28.4	The excess of the share is to be given to the eldest.

1.28.6	One should not go to see a fallen teacher or a relative.
1.28.7	Nor should one enjoy the possessions of such a person.
1.28.8	If one meets him by chance, one should silently accept him and pass by.
1.29.1	The Khatvāṅga, the staff, is the name of a rite. One who proclaims it should walk. Who would give alms to one who has killed an embryo? Having obtained a livelihood in the village, one should resort to an empty house or the root of a tree. There is no association with the noble ones for him. One should practice according to this very method, even from the best exhalation. There is no return for him in this world, but the sin is removed.
1.28.9	The mother undertakes many duties for the sake of her son, and is always attentive to him, even when he has fallen.
1.28.10	But there is no such accumulation of dharma.
1.29.2	He who kills the one who is helpless and has come to him, incurs the fruit of the fault.
1.29.3	Along with the intention.
1.29.4	So also in other sinful acts.
1.29.5	So also, in meritorious acts.
1.29.6	Even for the purpose of examination, a Brāhmaṇa should not take up a weapon.
1.29.7	For, in the Purāṇas, it is said that he who kills one who has advanced for the purpose of killing, only anger touches anger, and there is no fault in it.
1.28.11	Having permitted the enjoyment of wealth obtained by unrighteous means, having declared, “I am not unrighteous,” having covered the lower part of the body and the upper part of the thighs, having touched water three times, eating food without milk, salt, or oil, one should not enter a house for twelve years.
1.28.12	Then there is success.
1.28.13	Then there may be association with the noble ones.
1.29.8	Then, when they are cursed, they should come together and follow the Dharma. Thus, the priests and teachers of each other should marry each other.
1.29.9	Having produced sons, they should say, "O brahmins, go forth. Thus, our noble ones will be able to attain it."
1.29.10	But if he does not fall with the senses.
1.28.14	This is also the case with the other crimes leading to expulsion.
1.28.15	One who has committed incest should enter a hollow bamboo tube, set fire to it at both ends, and burn himself.
1.28.16	Hariṭa says that this is wrong.
1.28.17	For one who considers himself or another as supreme is indeed condemned.
1.29.11	This should be understood by this, that one who is deficient in a limb generates one who has a limb.
1.29.12	This is wrong, says Hariṭa.
1.29.13	A woman becomes like a curd-seller.
1.29.14	For, when one churns curd without effort, it does not accomplish the purpose of Dharma. Similarly, when the semen is withdrawn, there is no association with it.
1.28.18	By this very procedure, one should wander from the best breath-control. There is no return in this world, but sin is removed.
1.28.19	One who has violated the monastic code should wear a garment made of coarse cloth and go outside wearing the hair. One should wander for alms, saying, "For one who has violated the rules." One should wander for seven nights. That is the livelihood for six months.
1.28.20	But in the case of a woman, if she transgresses against her husband, she should perform the Kṛcchra and Dvādaśāha for twelve days.
1.28.21	Now, the one who has killed a foetus should wear the skin of a dog or a jackal, or the fur of a wild animal, outside the village, carrying a human skull as a begging bowl.
1.29.15	The two offences of Abhicāra and Anuvyañjana are expiables by Kshamaṇīya penance.
1.29.16	Hārīta says that these are Pātayantika offences.
1.29.17	The Pātayantikas are of twelve kinds: those that are to be expiated for twelve months, those that are to he expiated for half a month, those that are expiated for a month, those to be expiates for seven days, those to be exiated for three days, those to he expiates for a day, those to be cxpiated for half a day, those that are not to be expiating at all.
1.29.1	The Khatvāṅga, the staff, is the name of a rite. One who proclaims it should walk. Who would give alms to one who has killed an embryo? Having obtained a livelihood in the village, one should resort to an empty house or the root of a tree. There is no association with the noble ones for him. One should practice according to this very method, even from the best exhalation. There is no return for him in this world, but the sin is removed.
1.29.18	Thus, the practice of karma is like the despair of one who is impure.
1.30.1	Some say that one is purified by knowledge.
1.30.2	Similarly, by the vow of forty-eight.
1.30.3	Some say by the vow of knowledge.
1.30.4	In all of them, one should live like a graduate.
1.30.5	Due to the special concentration and the special hearing, there is a special result in worship.
1.30.6	Now, the vows of the graduate.
1.30.7	One should practice going out and coming in from the village by the eastern or northern gate.
1.30.8	And one should sit outside the village at dusk and dawn, with restraint of speech.
1.30.9	In the case of contradiction, the indication of hearing is stronger.
1.30.10	One should avoid all kinds of attachment in one's clothes.
1.30.11	And the natural black color.
1.30.12	One should wear clothes that are not too bright.
1.30.13	And according to one's ability, not too inferior.
1.29.8	Then, when they are cursed, they should come together and follow the Dharma. Thus, the priests and teachers of each other should marry each other.
1.29.9	Having produced sons, they should say, "O brahmins, go forth. Thus, our noble ones will be able to attain it."
1.29.10	But if he does not fall with the senses.
1.30.14	And he should avoid covering his head during the day, and should not neglect the duties of urinating and defecating.
1.30.15	But he should cover his head while urinating and defecatin, and should do it on the ground, concealing himself a little.
1.30.16	He should avoid urinating and defecatng in the shade.
1.30.17	He should urinate in his own shadow.
1.30.18	He should not urinate or defecate on a ladder, on plowed land, or in water.
1.29.11	This should be understood by this, that one who is deficient in a limb generates one who has a limb.
1.29.12	This is wrong, says Hariṭa.
1.29.13	A woman becomes like a curd-seller.
1.29.14	For, when one churns curd without effort, it does not accomplish the purpose of Dharma. Similarly, when the semen is withdrawn, there is no association with it.
1.30.19	So also, one should avoid the act of defecation and sexual intercourse in water.
1.30.20	One should avoid the act (of defecation and urination) facing the fire, the sun, water, a brahmin, cows, and the deities.
1.30.21	One should not cut down stones, clods of earth, wet herbs and trees, or upward-growing plants for the purpose of cleaning oneself after defecation and urination.
1.30.22	One should not stretch out one's hand towards fire, water, a brahmin, a cow, a deity, a door, or against the wind.
1.30.23	But they also say:
1.31.1	One should eat facing east, speak facing south, urinate facing north, and wash one's feet facing west.
1.29.15	The two offences of Abhicāra and Anuvyañjana are expiables by Kshamaṇīya penance.
1.29.16	Hārīta says that these are Pātayantika offences.
1.29.17	The Pātayantikas are of twelve kinds: those that are to be expiated for twelve months, those that are to he expiated for half a month, those that are expiated for a month, those to be expiates for seven days, those to be exiated for three days, those to he expiates for a day, those to be cxpiated for half a day, those that are not to be expiating at all.
1.31.2	And he should do the act of urinating and defecating facing the southern direction or the south-west direction.
1.31.3	And after sunset, he should avoid the act of urinatin and defecating outside the village or away from the dwelling.
1.31.4	And he should not address the deities without proper attention.
1.31.5	And he is harsh to both the deities and the king.
1.29.18	Thus, the practice of karma is like the despair of one who is impure.
1.30.1	Some say that one is purified by knowledge.
1.30.2	Similarly, by the vow of forty-eight.
1.30.3	Some say by the vow of knowledge.
1.30.4	In all of them, one should live like a graduate.
1.30.5	Due to the special concentration and the special hearing, there is a special result in worship.
1.30.6	Now, the vows of the graduate.
1.31.6	He should avoid touching the feet of a Brahmin or a cow.
1.31.7	And he should not touch them without reason.
1.31.8	He should avoid slander about cows, gifts, and young girls.
1.31.9	He should not call a cow that is giving milk a "milker."
1.31.10	And he should avoid calling a cow that is with her calf a "milker," except when there is a reason.
1.31.11	He shouldn't say "a cow that is not giving milk is not giving milk," but should say "a cow is not giving milk."
1.30.7	One should practice going out and coming in from the village by the eastern or northern gate.
1.30.8	And one should sit outside the village at dusk and dawn, with restraint of speech.

1.31.17	He should not look at one who is falling.
1.31.18	He should avoid looking at the rising or setting sun.
1.31.19	The sun protects beings by day, and the moon by night. Therefore, one who desires to protect oneself should study during the night of the new moon, and during the time of the observance of celibacy, one should protect oneself by conduct.
1.30.14	And he should avoid covering his head during the day, and should not neglect the duties of urinating and defecating.
1.30.15	But he should cover his head while urinating and defecatin, and should do it on the ground, concealing himself a little.
1.30.16	He should avoid urinating and defecatng in the shade.
1.30.17	He should urinate in his own shadow.

1.31.22	One should not give leftovers to a non-Brahmin. If one does give, one should spit on one's teeth and give them to him.

2.9.14	The three, the householder, the one who has kindled the sacred fire, and the celibate, succeed while eating, not while not eating.
2.10.1	In begging, the cause is the teacher, marriage, sacrifice, the mother and father, the desire to be wealthy, and the omission of rules by the deserving.

2.11.10-13	By the practice of virtue, a man of inferior caste attains a higher caste in the course of his successive births. By the practice of vice, a man of superior caste attains an inferior caste in the course of his successive births. Hence one should not be attached to caste.

2.12.12	One should not join one's hands behind one's back.

2.12.18	Or if there is a transgression of any other rule,
2.12.19	And if there is doubt about the result of the transgression, one should not do it.
2.12.20	This is also the case with chapters and non-chapters.
2.10.16	By means of special strength, he should reduce them by means of rules, except for killing and slavery.
2.11.1	After examining the duties of the other castes until their separation from life, the king should impose punishment.
2.11.2	And he should not impose punishment in doubt.
2.11.3	Having examined well and having consulted with divinatory questions, the king should proceed to punishment.
2.11.4	A king who behaves thus conquers both worlds.
2.12.21	He should not speak in doubt, as if he were seeing with his own eyes.
2.12.22	In the case of the successively increasing impurities of the nails, the teeth, the head, the head-hairs, the body-hairs, the skin, the flesh, the bones, the marrow, and the brain, the successive increase of the impurities is greater and greater.
2.12.23	Some say that this sign should be removed after being used.
2.11.5	The path of the king is to be given to a Brāhmaṇa only after he has met him.

2.11.10-13	By the practice of virtue, a man of inferior caste attains a higher caste in the course of his successive births. By the practice of vice, a man of superior caste attains an inferior caste in the course of his successive births. Hence one should not be attached to caste. One should not have intercourse with another woman when one's wife is endowed with virtue and progeny. If either of them is absent, one should perform the rites before the setting up of the fire.
2.13.6	Now they also quote: "Now, Janaka, I am jealous of women, not before, when in Yama's abode, the sons of the begetter said: 'The semen-bearer takes the son and goes to Yama's abode.' Therefore, fearing the semen of others, they protect their wives. Be careful, protect this thread, lest other seeds be sown in your field. The son of the begetter becomes the son in the hereafter. The knower makes this thread futile."
2.13.7	The transgression of Dharma and the rashness of the ancients have been seen.
2.13.8	Due to the special brilliance of those, there is no adverse effect.
2.13.9	One who employs it after examining it, the inferior one, becomes distressed.
2.13.10	There is no buying and selling of children.
2.11.14	For, when there is a marriage, it is connected with rites, which have this as an accessory.
2.11.15	One should not give one's daughter to a person of the same gotra.
2.11.16	Because of the relationship between the mother and the womb.
2.11.17	In the Brahmanical marriage, having understood the qualities of the relatives, character, learning, and health, one should give her to a person who is capable of bearing children and has the means, after adorning him.
2.11.18	In the Ārṣa marriage, two cows should be given to the couple.
2.13.11	In the case of a marriage, it is heard that the gift is for the sake of Dharma and Kama, and therefore, a hundred should be given to Adhiratha in the case of a daughter. One should make it double. The word "purchase" in that context is merely praise. The connection is from Dharma.
2.13.12	Having satisfied the eldest with a single wealth.
2.11.19	The priest should be paid in the sacrificial rites of the gods.
2.11.20	If they unite through mutual desire, it is Gandharva.
2.12.1	If they carry on giving goods in the sphere of power, it is Asura.
2.12.2	If they take a daughter and carry on, it is Rakshasa.
2.12.3	Of these three, the first three are recommended, the earlier one being better than the later.
2.12.4	As the marriage is proper, so the progeny becomes proper.
2.14.1	A living father shall divide his property equally among his sons, except the impotent, the insane, and the fallen.
2.14.2	If there is no son, the nearest Sapiṇḍa shall inherit.
2.14.3	If there be no Sapiṇḍa, the Ācārya, if there be no Ācārya the Antarvāsī, shall take it and use it for the purpose of Dharma.

2.14.7	In some countries, gold, black cows, and black land are given to the eldest son.
2.14.8	The chariot and household goods belong to the father.
2.14.9	Some say that ornaments belong to the wife and wealth from relatives.
2.14.10	This is contradicted by other scriptures.
2.14.11	Manu is heard to have divided the inheritance among his sons without specifying.
2.12.11	When the fire is being carried in front, one should not circumambulate it while standing on the ground.
2.12.12	One should not join one's hands behind one's back.
2.12.13	One should sleep with one's face down and not be careless. One should not keep horses at night. When it becomes day, one should touch water and then speak.
2.14.12	But even if it is heard that they give the eldest son wealth, then it is said that it is a single statement.
2.14.13	But even if the knowers of law say that a constant statement is not a rule, as it is said that the goat and sheep graze together with the cattle, therefore the mouth of the graduate seems to be drooping, therefore the bull and the student are at the mercy of women.
2.12.14	One who has slept should not ride a horse or speak until the sun rises.
2.12.15	Some say one should restrain one's breath until sunset.
2.12.16	Or if one has seen a bad dream,
2.12.17	Or if one wishes to accomplish a goal,
2.12.18	Or if there is a transgression of any other rule,
2.12.19	And if there is doubt about the result of the transgression, one should not do it.
2.12.20	This is also the case with chapters and non-chapters.
2.14.14	All of them are entitled to a share in the property, if they are united by Dharma.
2.14.15	But if a person gives away the property by means of Adharma, even the eldest brother should not give him a share.
2.14.16	There is no division between husband and wife.
2.14.17	Because from the time of marriage, they are united in all their duties.
2.14.18	And in the fruits of merit.
2.14.19	And in all possessions.
2.12.21	He should not speak in doubt, as if he were seeing with his own eyes.
2.12.22	In the case of the successively increasing impurities of the nails, the teeth, the head, the head-hairs, the body-hairs, the skin, the flesh, the bones, the marrow, and the brain, the successive increase of the impurities is greater and greater.
2.12.23	Some say that this sign should be removed after being used.
2.14.20	For, when the husband is absent on some business, stealing is not enjoined.
2.15.1	By this is explained the duty of the country and the family.
2.15.2	The sprinkling of water on the dead bodies of the mother's relations up to the seventh generation, and of the father's relations, as far as their relationship is known, and of those who have died before the year is completed,
2.15.3	The mother and the father alone are entitled to the performance of the rites.
2.13.1	The sons of a man who goes to a woman of his own caste according to the rules laid down in the sacred texts, are connected with him by their acts.
2.13.2	The father and the son should not transgress the rules of inheritance.
2.13.3	If a man has intercourse with a woman of an inferior caste, there is a sin.
2.13.4	Even there, the son is sinful.
2.13.5	For, it is said in the Brāhmaṇa that the son belongs to the begetter.
2.15.4	Those who take away.
2.15.5	One should not eat before one's wife, who is the supreme guru, has eaten.
2.15.6	They should make food for the sick.
2.15.7	Shaving their hair, covering themselves with dust, wearing one garment, facing south, they should bathe once and then sit down.
2.15.8	This is done three times.
2.15.9	When they have heard the news, they go to the village, and do what the women have said.
2.15.10	The others teach only this.
2.15.11	One should feed the pure, those who know the mantra, in all rites.
2.15.12	It teaches about giving in terms of place, time, purity, and proper recipient.
2.13.6	Now they also quote: "Now, Janaka, I am jealous of women, not before, when in Yama's abode, the sons of the begetter said: 'The semen-bearer takes the son and goes to Yama's abode.' Therefore, fearing the semen of others, they protect their wives. Be careful, protect this thread, lest other seeds be sown in your field. The son of the begetter becomes the son in the hereafter. The knower makes this thread futile."
2.13.7	The transgression of Dharma and the rashness of the ancients have been seen.
2.13.8	Due to the special brilliance of those, there is no adverse effect.
2.13.9	One who employs it after examining it, the inferior one, becomes distressed.
2.13.10	There is no buying and selling of children.
2.15.13	That which is not offered in the fire and whose beginning is not given, that should not be eaten.
2.15.14	There is no offering of salt and alkali.
2.15.15	And also of food mixed with inferior food.
2.15.16	One should offer oblation of food without ghee, removing hot ashes towards the north, and offer it there. That which is offered and not offered becomes in the fire.
2.15.17	A woman should not offer, nor one who is not initiated.
2.13.11	In the case of a marriage, it is heard that the gift is for the sake of Dharma and Kama, and therefore, a hundred should be given to Adhiratha in the case of a daughter. One should make it double. The word "purchase" in that context is merely praise. The connection is from Dharma.
2.13.12	Having satisfied the eldest with a single wealth.
2.15.18	From the first feeding of rice, the embryo is not born without effort.
2.15.19	Some say: until the end of the year.
2.15.20	Until one knows the directions.
2.15.21	Others say: from the ceremony of naming.
2.15.22	Here the authority of the scriptures is found.
2.15.23	That is the conclusion.
2.15.24	And also in the Smriti:
2.16.1	In ancient times, gods and men existed together in this world. Then the gods went to heaven by their deeds, and men became inferior. Those who undertake such deeds as those, they become with the gods and Brahma in this world. Now Manu, the son of Praja, proclaimed this rite called "Shraddha".
2.16.2	For the welfare of offspring.
2.14.1	A living father shall divide his property equally among his sons, except the impotent, the insane, and the fallen.
2.14.2	If there is no son, the nearest Sapiṇḍa shall inherit.
2.14.3	If there be no Sapiṇḍa, the Ācārya, if there be no Ācārya the Antarvāsī, shall take it and use it for the purpose of Dharma.
2.14.4	Or a daughter.
2.14.5	If there are no such persons, the king shall take the property.
2.16.3	There, the Pitrs are the deities, and the Brahmanas are for the purpose of the Ahavaniya.
2.16.4	The rite is to be performed every month.
2.16.5	The afternoon of the dark fortnight is better.
2.16.6	So also the latter days of the dark fortnight.
2.16.7	When the rite is performed on any day of the dark fortnight, it pleases the Pitrs. But the restriction of time brings about a special result.
2.14.6	Some say that the eldest son is the heir.
2.14.7	In some countries, gold, black cows, and black land are given to the eldest son.
2.14.8	The chariot and household goods belong to the father.
2.14.9	Some say that ornaments belong to the wife and wealth from relatives.
2.14.10	This is contradicted by other scriptures.
2.14.11	Manu is heard to have divided the inheritance among his sons without specifying.
2.14.12	But even if it is heard that they give the eldest son wealth, then it is said that it is a single statement.
2.14.13	But even if the knowers of law say that a constant statement is not a rule, as it is said that the goat and sheep graze together with the cattle, therefore the mouth of the graduate seems to be drooping, therefore the bull and the student are at the mercy of women.
2.16.8	If the marriage is performed on the first day, the offspring will be mostly female.
2.16.9	On the second day, they will be thieves.
2.16.10	On the third day, they will have brahminical lustre.
2.16.11	On the fourth day, they will own small animals.
2.16.12	On the fifth day, they will become males, having many offspring, and no one will die without offspring.
2.16.13	On the sixth day, they will possess good conduct and good fortune.
2.16.14	On the seventh day, there will be prosperity in the field.
2.16.15	On the eighth day, there will prosperity.
2.14.14	All of them are entitled to a share in the property, if they are united by Dharma.
2.14.15	But if a person gives away the property by means of Adharma, even the eldest brother should not give him a share.
2.14.16	There is no division between husband and wife.
2.14.17	Because from the time of marriage, they are united in all their duties.
2.14.18	And in the fruits of merit.
2.14.19	And in all possessions.
2.16.16	The ninth is Ekakhurā.
2.16.17	In the tenth, there is success in business.
2.16.18	In the eleventh, there is iron, tin, and lead.
2.16.19	In the twelfth, there is cattle.
2.16.20	In the thirteenth, one has many sons, many friends, beautiful children, and one becomes a youth.
2.16.21	In the fourteenth, there is success with weapons.
2.16.22	In the fifteenth, there is prosperity.
2.16.23	There, the substances are sesamum, beans, rice, barley, water, roots and fruits.
2.16.24	In food with oil, the satisfaction of the manes is more intense and lasts longer.
2.16.25	Similarly, when the substance is obtained by religious means and is offered at a sacred place.
2.16.26	For a year, there is satisfaction with cow's milk.
2.16.27	More than that, with buffalo's milk.
2.14.20	For, when the husband is absent on some business, stealing is not enjoined.
2.15.1	By this is explained the duty of the country and the family.
2.15.2	The sprinkling of water on the dead bodies of the mother's relations up to the seventh generation, and of the father's relations, as far as their relationship is known, and of those who have died before the year is completed,
2.15.3	The mother and the father alone are entitled to the performance of the rites.
2.15.4	Those who take away.
2.15.5	One should not eat before one's wife, who is the supreme guru, has eaten.
2.15.6	They should make food for the sick.
2.15.7	Shaving their hair, covering themselves with dust, wearing one garment, facing south, they should bathe once and then sit down.
2.15.8	This is done three times.
2.16.28	This explains the meat of domestic and wild animals as fit to be eaten.
2.17.1	One should eat meat of a sword-fish with the sword-fish meat for eternity.
2.17.2	Similarly, with the meat of a hundred-armed fish.
2.17.3	And with the meat of the Varadranasa fish.
2.17.4	One should feed Brahmins who are learned in the Vedas, who belong to the same caste, family, mantra, and lineage, with a pure and calm mind.
2.15.9	When they have heard the news, they go to the village, and do what the women have said.
2.15.10	The others teach only this.
2.15.11	One should feed the pure, those who know the mantra, in all rites.
2.15.12	It teaches about giving in terms of place, time, purity, and proper recipient.
2.17.5	But if the other person has lost his qualities, then even a brother should be fed.
2.17.6	This explains the meaning of the term "antavasin" (resident).
2.17.7	But they also quote:
2.17.8	"The name of the ghost's alms is Sambhojani. It does not go to the ancestors or the gods. It wanders here itself, having exhausted its merit, like a cow in a barn, having lost its calf."
2.15.13	That which is not offered in the fire and whose beginning is not given, that should not be eaten.
2.15.14	There is no offering of salt and alkali.
2.15.15	And also of food mixed with inferior food.
2.15.16	One should offer oblation of food without ghee, removing hot ashes towards the north, and offer it there. That which is offered and not offered becomes in the fire.
2.15.17	A woman should not offer, nor one who is not initiated.
2.17.9	The Dakṣiṇā is enjoyed here itself, and the family perishes from one generation to another.
2.17.10	Among those having equal qualities, the elder is better, and the one who is poor in wealth is better.
2.17.11	The first day is for informing.
2.17.12	The second day is for the second.
2.17.13	The third day is for inviting.
2.17.14	Some teach that the Śrāddha is done three times.
2.17.15	As it is done on the first day, so it is done on second and third days.
2.15.18	From the first feeding of rice, the embryo is not born without effort.
2.15.19	Some say: until the end of the year.
2.15.20	Until one knows the directions.
2.15.21	Others say: from the ceremony of naming.
2.15.22	Here the authority of the scriptures is found.
2.15.23	That is the conclusion.
2.15.24	And also in the Smriti:
2.17.16	After all the rites have been performed, he should offer the remaining oblation to the fire, as prescribed.
2.17.17	If the rite is performed in the north, the water vessels should be brought to the hands of those seated.
2.17.18	He invites them, saying, "Let the fire be raised and offered."
2.16.1	In ancient times, gods and men existed together in this world. Then the gods went to heaven by their deeds, and men became inferior. Those who undertake such deeds as those, they become with the gods and Brahma in this world. Now Manu, the son of Praja, proclaimed this rite called "Shraddha".
2.16.2	For the welfare of offspring.
2.16.3	There, the Pitrs are the deities, and the Brahmanas are for the purpose of the Ahavaniya.
2.16.4	The rite is to be performed every month.
2.16.5	The afternoon of the dark fortnight is better.
2.16.6	So also the latter days of the dark fortnight.
2.16.7	When the rite is performed on any day of the dark fortnight, it pleases the Pitrs. But the restriction of time brings about a special result.
2.17.19	If one is not able to do so, one should say, “May it be taken away! May it be offered in the fire!” One should offer it in the fire.
2.17.20	It is said that the sight of a dog, a vessel without food, or a person without a proper vessel is inauspicious for a śrāddha.
2.17.21	A person with leprosy, a person with a goiter, a person who sleeps with another person’s wife, a person whose father was a soldier, a person born to a Śūdra mother and a Brāhmaṇa father—these persons, when eating at a śrāddha, are considered to be defilers of the row.
2.17.22	Those who are learned in the Vedas, the son of a teacher, and the son of a student, these, when eating at a śrāddha, purify the row.
2.17.23	One should not perform a śrāddha at night.
2.17.24	When the meal has begun, one should not eat until it is finished.
2.17.25	Except when there is a sighting of Rāhu.
2.16.8	If the marriage is performed on the first day, the offspring will be mostly female.
2.16.9	On the second day, they will be thieves.
2.16.10	On the third day, they will have brahminical lustre.
2.16.11	On the fourth day, they will own small animals.
2.16.12	On the fifth day, they will become males, having many offspring, and no one will die without offspring.
2.16.13	On the sixth day, they will possess good conduct and good fortune.
2.16.14	On the seventh day, there will be prosperity in the field.
2.16.15	On the eighth day, there will prosperity.
2.18.1	He should avoid the use of honey, meat, and oil-cake, and the act of churning.
2.18.2	Black grains, food of the Śūdra caste, and other things which are not to be eaten.
2.18.3	One who desires memory, fame, intelligence, heaven, and prosperity should avoid twelve things: food that is not fit for eating, untruth, anger, and that by which one may be angered.
2.16.16	The ninth is Ekakhurā.
2.16.17	In the tenth, there is success in business.
2.16.18	In the eleventh, there is iron, tin, and lead.
2.16.19	In the twelfth, there is cattle.
2.16.20	In the thirteenth, one has many sons, many friends, beautiful children, and one becomes a youth.
2.16.21	In the fourteenth, there is success with weapons.
2.16.22	In the fifteenth, there is prosperity.
2.18.4	Having covered the lower part of the body up to the knees, he should touch water three times, and should live without eating food cooked in fire, without shade, near a place, and for a year he should observe this vow. This is said to be forty-eight units.
2.18.5	The daily śrāddha
2.18.6	The pure ones perform it outside the village in a pure place.
2.16.23	There, the substances are sesamum, beans, rice, barley, water, roots and fruits.
2.16.24	In food with oil, the satisfaction of the manes is more intense and lasts longer.
2.16.25	Similarly, when the substance is obtained by religious means and is offered at a sacred place.
2.16.26	For a year, there is satisfaction with cow's milk.
2.16.27	More than that, with buffalo's milk.
2.18.7	There are nine substances.
2.18.8	By which food is prepared and in which it is eaten.
2.18.9	And they should give it to those who have eaten.
2.18.10	And should feed those who have gathered.
2.18.11	And should not give leftovers to one who is not of their quality.
2.18.12	Thus for a year.
2.18.13	The best of them should be made of iron and goat.
2.18.14	And should make a measure hidden.
2.16.28	This explains the meat of domestic and wild animals as fit to be eaten.
2.17.1	One should eat meat of a sword-fish with the sword-fish meat for eternity.
2.17.2	Similarly, with the meat of a hundred-armed fish.
2.17.3	And with the meat of the Varadranasa fish.
2.17.4	One should feed Brahmins who are learned in the Vedas, who belong to the same caste, family, mantra, and lineage, with a pure and calm mind.
2.18.15	He should feed Brahmins in the northern half of the house.
2.18.16	They see both the Brahmins eating and the ancestors being honoured. This is what they are taught.
2.18.17	From now on, the rites are performed according to the rules.
2.18.18	The ancestors express their satisfaction through the Śrāddha rite.
2.18.19	One who desires prosperity should perform the rite on the Tīṣya constellation.
2.17.5	But if the other person has lost his qualities, then even a brother should be fed.
2.17.6	This explains the meaning of the term "antavasin" (resident).
2.17.7	But they also quote:
2.17.8	"The name of the ghost's alms is Sambhojani. It does not go to the ancestors or the gods. It wanders here itself, having exhausted its merit, like a cow in a barn, having lost its calf."
2.19.1	Having made a powder of white mustard seeds, he should wash his hands and feet with it, and having eaten it in his mouth and ears, if the wind does not blow too much, he should sit on a woolen mat. This is the first rule for Bast. He should eat facing south, controlling his speech.
2.19.2	They say that eating with the face turned away is inauspicious for the mother.
2.17.9	The Dakṣiṇā is enjoyed here itself, and the family perishes from one generation to another.
2.17.10	Among those having equal qualities, the elder is better, and the one who is poor in wealth is better.
2.17.11	The first day is for informing.
2.17.12	The second day is for the second.
2.17.13	The third day is for inviting.
2.17.14	Some teach that the Śrāddha is done three times.
2.17.15	As it is done on the first day, so it is done on second and third days.
2.19.3-11	The bowl should be made of Udumbara wood, with a golden rim, and should be used for serving. One should not eat with anything else. One should take food in the proper quantity. One should eat without making any sound. One should avoid making any sound. One should eat without making a sound. One may eat the entire portion of food along with the thumb. One should refrain from making any sound while eating. One should also refrain from shaking the hand.
2.17.16	After all the rites have been performed, he should offer the remaining oblation to the fire, as prescribed.
2.17.17	If the rite is performed in the north, the water vessels should be brought to the hands of those seated.
2.17.18	He invites them, saying, "Let the fire be raised and offered."
2.19.12	Having sipped water, he should hold the hands upwards until the water is absorbed.
2.19.13	Then he should touch the fire.
2.19.14	He should not eat during the day, except for roots and fruits.
2.19.15	He should also avoid the dishes that are prescribed for the Sthalipaka sacrifice.
2.19.16	He should eat with his upper garment on and wearing the sacred thread.
2.19.17	But he should give the funeral rites to his preceptor only with affection.
2.19.18	Butter and meat are the first option.
2.19.19	If not available, oil and vegetables are the second option.
2.19.20	In the Magha constellation, one should feed Brahmins with butter according to the rules of a funeral rite.
2.20.1	In the monthly funeral rite, one should use a measure of sesame seeds, as much as one can afford.
2.17.19	If one is not able to do so, one should say, “May it be taken away! May it be offered in the fire!” One should offer it in the fire.
2.17.20	It is said that the sight of a dog, a vessel without food, or a person without a proper vessel is inauspicious for a śrāddha.
2.17.21	A person with leprosy, a person with a goiter, a person who sleeps with another person’s wife, a person whose father was a soldier, a person born to a Śūdra mother and a Brāhmaṇa father—these persons, when eating at a śrāddha, are considered to be defilers of the row.
2.20.2	And he should feed those who have assembled, and should not give them leftovers that are not of the same quality.
2.20.3	In the ascending lunar fortnight, having fasted for one night in the waning lunar fortnight, desiring prosperity, having cooked a pot-rice offering with Tishya, having worshipped the great king, having fed a brahmin with that ghee-offering, and having recited the mantra for prosperity, one should recite the mantra for prosperity.
2.17.22	Those who are learned in the Vedas, the son of a teacher, and the son of a student, these, when eating at a śrāddha, purify the row.
2.17.23	One should not perform a śrāddha at night.
2.17.24	When the meal has begun, one should not eat until it is finished.
2.17.25	Except when there is a sighting of Rāhu.
2.20.4	Thus every day until the next full moon.
2.20.5	Two on the second day.
2.20.6	Three on the third day.
2.20.7	Thus, increasing by one each day, for a year.
2.20.8	He nourishes the great nourishment.
2.20.9	Fasting begins right away.
2.20.10	One should avoid eating food that has been touched by someone else.
2.20.11	The foundation is made of ashes and grass.
2.20.12	One should not use the foundation for washing one's feet or for standing.
2.18.1	He should avoid the use of honey, meat, and oil-cake, and the act of churning.
2.18.2	Black grains, food of the Śūdra caste, and other things which are not to be eaten.
2.18.3	One who desires memory, fame, intelligence, heaven, and prosperity should avoid twelve things: food that is not fit for eating, untruth, anger, and that by which one may be angered.
2.20.13	And shaking the feet.
2.20.14	And pressing the knees on the thighs.
2.20.15	And scratching with nails.
2.20.16	And snapping without reason.
2.20.17	And whatever else is described.
2.20.18	And being engaged in Dharma and in the possession of wealth.
2.20.19	And being a guide at a holy place.
2.20.20	And being in control at an unholy place, so that there is no fear.
2.18.4	Having covered the lower part of the body up to the knees, he should touch water three times, and should live without eating food cooked in fire, without shade, near a place, and for a year he should observe this vow. This is said to be forty-eight units.
2.18.5	The daily śrāddha
2.18.6	The pure ones perform it outside the village in a pure place.
2.20.21	And he is the collector of men.
2.20.22	And he is the enjoyer of pleasures not prohibited by religion.
2.20.23	Thus he conquers both worlds.
2.21.1	The four stages of life are householder, teacher, silence, and forest-dweller.
2.21.2	In all of them, one who proceeds without distraction according to the instructions attains peace.
2.18.7	There are nine substances.
2.18.8	By which food is prepared and in which it is eaten.
2.18.9	And they should give it to those who have eaten.
2.18.10	And should feed those who have gathered.
2.18.11	And should not give leftovers to one who is not of their quality.
2.18.12	Thus for a year.
2.18.13	The best of them should be made of iron and goat.
2.18.14	And should make a measure hidden.
2.21.3	All of them should live in the teacher's house from the time of Upanayana onwards.
2.21.4	All of them should be released from the study of Vedas.
2.21.5	Having understood the rites, one should undertake them as one wishes.
2.21.6	As for the student, this is the rule: he should not leave the teacher's home until he has completed his studies. The body of a celibate should be deposited in the teacher'house.
2.21.7	Now about the wandering ascetic.
2.21.8	One who is celibate should renounce only for this reason.
2.18.15	He should feed Brahmins in the northern half of the house.
2.18.16	They see both the Brahmins eating and the ancestors being honoured. This is what they are taught.
2.18.17	From now on, the rites are performed according to the rules.
2.18.18	The ancestors express their satisfaction through the Śrāddha rite.
2.18.19	One who desires prosperity should perform the rite on the Tīṣya constellation.
2.21.9	They instruct him thus:
2.21.10	"Let him be without fire, without a home, without a protector, without a refuge, a sage, abandoning speech, and living on alms, he should wander without this world or the next."
2.21.11	His robe is said to be released.
2.21.12	Some say that he is completely liberated.
2.19.1	Having made a powder of white mustard seeds, he should wash his hands and feet with it, and having eaten it in his mouth and ears, if the wind does not blow too much, he should sit on a woolen mat. This is the first rule for Bast. He should eat facing south, controlling his speech.
2.19.2	They say that eating with the face turned away is inauspicious for the mother.
2.21.13	Having abandoned the truth and untruth, happiness and sorrow, and having abandoned this world and the next, one should seek the Self.
2.21.14	The Buddha is the means of attaining peace.
2.21.15	It is contradicted by other scriptures.
2.21.16	If the Buddha is the means to attaining peace, one would not perceive suffering here itself.
2.21.17	This explains the other world.
2.21.18	Or, the forest-dweller.
2.19.3-11	The bowl should be made of Udumbara wood, with a golden rim, and should be used for serving. One should not eat with anything else. One should take food in the proper quantity. One should eat without making any sound. One should avoid making any sound. One should eat without making a sound. One may eat the entire portion of food along with the thumb. One should refrain from making any sound while eating. One should also refrain from shaking the hand.
2.21.19	Therefore, one who is devoted to celibacy renounces.
2.21.20	They instruct him:
2.21.21	"One should be a single-fire ascetic, without a dwelling, a sage without a protector or refuge, abandoning speech except for recitation."
2.22.1	His covering is prescribed as the forest.
2.22.2	Then, living on roots, fruits, leaves, and grass, he should wander.
2.22.3	Even the most advanced ones.
2.19.12	Having sipped water, he should hold the hands upwards until the water is absorbed.
2.19.13	Then he should touch the fire.
2.19.14	He should not eat during the day, except for roots and fruits.
2.19.15	He should also avoid the dishes that are prescribed for the Sthalipaka sacrifice.
2.19.16	He should eat with his upper garment on and wearing the sacred thread.
2.19.17	But he should give the funeral rites to his preceptor only with affection.
2.22.4	Then he should concentrate on water, wind, and space.
2.22.5	The subsequent ones are superior in terms of their effects.
2.22.6	Or some teach the sequence of the forest-dweller alone.
2.22.7	Having completed his studies, married, and established the fires, he undertakes the rites that are heard to be performed during the latter half of the moon.
2.19.18	Butter and meat are the first option.
2.19.19	If not available, oil and vegetables are the second option.
2.19.20	In the Magha constellation, one should feed Brahmins with butter according to the rules of a funeral rite.
2.20.1	In the monthly funeral rite, one should use a measure of sesame seeds, as much as one can afford.
2.22.8	Having made a house, with his wife and children, he should live outside the village with the fire.
2.22.9	Or alone.
2.22.10	He should live by begging.
2.22.11	He should not accept anything above that.
2.22.12	And he should offer oblations.
2.22.13	He should slowly approach the water, striking it, touching the water facing the sun.
2.22.14	Thus is the rule for sprinkling water everywhere.
2.22.15	They say that one should give one of the two things for cooking, eating, wearing, axe, and ladle.
2.22.16	Taking one of the two, giving the others, one should stay in the forest.
2.22.17	From then on, one should perform the fire sacrifice, subsist on forest produce, and wait for covering.
2.20.2	And he should feed those who have assembled, and should not give them leftovers that are not of the same quality.
2.20.3	In the ascending lunar fortnight, having fasted for one night in the waning lunar fortnight, desiring prosperity, having cooked a pot-rice offering with Tishya, having worshipped the great king, having fed a brahmin with that ghee-offering, and having recited the mantra for prosperity, one should recite the mantra for prosperity.
2.22.18	In those rites where there are cakes and oblations, they should be offered.
2.22.19	All this should be done in a low voice, along with self-study.
2.22.20	One should not invite a person from the forest.
2.22.21	For the sake of fire, one should seek refuge.
2.22.22	In the sky, oneself.
2.22.23	On a bed or seat not spread out.
2.22.24	When new grain is obtained, one should allow the old grain.
2.20.4	Thus every day until the next full moon.
2.20.5	Two on the second day.
2.20.6	Three on the third day.
2.20.7	Thus, increasing by one each day, for a year.
2.20.8	He nourishes the great nourishment.
2.20.9	Fasting begins right away.
2.20.10	One should avoid eating food that has been touched by someone else.
2.20.11	The foundation is made of ashes and grass.
2.20.12	One should not use the foundation for washing one's feet or for standing.
2.23.1	Or, if he wishes to observe a more extensive rule, he may collect alms every day with a bowl, in the evening and morning.
2.23.2	Then, living on roots, fruits, leaves, and grass, he should proceed, and finally resort to water, air, and space. The union of each succeeding one is superior to the preceding one in terms of fruit.
2.23.3	Now, two verses are cited from the Puranas:
2.20.13	And shaking the feet.
2.20.14	And pressing the knees on the thighs.
2.20.15	And scratching with nails.
2.20.16	And snapping without reason.
2.20.17	And whatever else is described.
2.20.18	And being engaged in Dharma and in the possession of wealth.
2.20.19	And being a guide at a holy place.
2.20.20	And being in control at an unholy place, so that there is no fear.
2.23.4	The eighty-eight thousand sages who have gone to the path of the right, they have gone to the cremation grounds.
2.23.5	The eighty-eight thousand who have gone to heaven, they have gone by the path of the left.
2.23.6	Thus is the praise of the ascetics.
2.23.7	Now, even if they are accomplished through imagination.
2.20.21	And he is the collector of men.
2.20.22	And he is the enjoyer of pleasures not prohibited by religion.
2.20.23	Thus he conquers both worlds.
2.21.1	The four stages of life are householder, teacher, silence, and forest-dweller.
2.21.2	In all of them, one who proceeds without distraction according to the instructions attains peace.
2.23.8	As the giving of progeny is like rain, and the other qualities are also appropriate,
2.23.9	Therefore, some people say that these stages of life are superior because they are the result of hearing and direct perception.
2.21.3	All of them should live in the teacher's house from the time of Upanayana onwards.
2.21.4	All of them should be released from the study of Vedas.
2.21.5	Having understood the rites, one should undertake them as one wishes.
2.21.6	As for the student, this is the rule: he should not leave the teacher's home until he has completed his studies. The body of a celibate should be deposited in the teacher'house.
2.21.7	Now about the wandering ascetic.
2.21.8	One who is celibate should renounce only for this reason.
2.23.10	The Vedas are the authority for the learned in the three Vedas. The rites that are heard there, such as the connection with barley, rice, animals, ghee, milk, skull, and wife, and the rites of high and low, are considered to be the authority. The conduct contrary to those is considered to be the non-authority.
2.23.11	But what is called the cremation ground is the rite of the end of various rites, which is prescribed for the purification of the person.
2.21.9	They instruct him thus:
2.21.10	"Let him be without fire, without a home, without a protector, without a refuge, a sage, abandoning speech, and living on alms, he should wander without this world or the next."
2.21.11	His robe is said to be released.
2.21.12	Some say that he is completely liberated.
2.23.12	Then after that, the fruit is heard to be endless and heavenly.
2.24.1	And even if he says that his birth is immortality, he says, "You are born after your offspring, that is your mortal and immortal."
2.24.2	And even if this very one is seen separately by direct perception, and similarity is also seen, the body is only different.
2.21.13	Having abandoned the truth and untruth, happiness and sorrow, and having abandoned this world and the next, one should seek the Self.
2.21.14	The Buddha is the means of attaining peace.
2.21.15	It is contradicted by other scriptures.
2.21.16	If the Buddha is the means to attaining peace, one would not perceive suffering here itself.
2.21.17	This explains the other world.
2.21.18	Or, the forest-dweller.
2.24.3	Those who are engaged in the remaining duties, by the merit of their ancestors, increase their fame and heaven.
2.24.4	Thus the lower and lower ones are of the higher ones.
2.24.5	They attain heaven till the end of the world.
2.24.6	In the future Puranas, they are said to be the seeds of the next creation.
2.24.7	But even then, it is said in the words of Prajapati:
2.24.8	The three Vedas, celibacy, progeny, faith, penance, sacrifice, and giving - those who perform these, they become one with the dust and perish. The others praise it.
2.24.9	Among them, those who commit sins perish, but they do not harm others, like a leaf of a tree.
2.21.19	Therefore, one who is devoted to celibacy renounces.
2.21.20	They instruct him:
2.21.21	"One should be a single-fire ascetic, without a dwelling, a sage without a protector or refuge, abandoning speech except for recitation."
2.22.1	His covering is prescribed as the forest.
2.22.2	Then, living on roots, fruits, leaves, and grass, he should wander.
2.22.3	Even the most advanced ones.
2.24.10	There is no connection of this with the acts in this world, nor with the fruits of acts in the other world.
2.24.11	This should be known by this.
2.24.12	This is the creation of Prajapati and the sages.
2.24.13	Among them, those who have done meritorious deeds, their natures are seen to be shining brightly.
2.22.4	Then he should concentrate on water, wind, and space.
2.22.5	The subsequent ones are superior in terms of their effects.
2.22.6	Or some teach the sequence of the forest-dweller alone.
2.22.7	Having completed his studies, married, and established the fires, he undertakes the rites that are heard to be performed during the latter half of the moon.
2.22.8	Having made a house, with his wife and children, he should live outside the village with the fire.
2.22.9	Or alone.
2.22.10	He should live by begging.
2.22.11	He should not accept anything above that.
2.22.12	And he should offer oblations.
2.22.13	He should slowly approach the water, striking it, touching the water facing the sun.
2.24.14	But some one may conquer the world of the end of the body by means of a part of his Karma or by penance, and there may be the fulfilment of his desire, but that does not make him the eldest of the orders.
2.25.1	The general and special duties of all castes have been explained. Now we shall speak of the special duties of the king.
2.25.2	He should build his house and city at the southern gate.
2.25.3	The house should be built in the middle of the city.
2.22.14	Thus is the rule for sprinkling water everywhere.
2.22.15	They say that one should give one of the two things for cooking, eating, wearing, axe, and ladle.
2.22.16	Taking one of the two, giving the others, one should stay in the forest.
2.22.17	From then on, one should perform the fire sacrifice, subsist on forest produce, and wait for covering.
2.25.4	The house in front of which is called the "invitation-house".
2.25.5	The assembly-house should be to the right of the city, with doors on the right and left, so that both the inside and outside may be seen.
2.25.6	All the fires should be without smoke.
2.25.7	Worship of fire should be done daily, as in the Gṛhyamédha.
2.25.8	In the house one should entertain guests, half of whom should be Brahmins.
2.22.18	In those rites where there are cakes and oblations, they should be offered.
2.22.19	All this should be done in a low voice, along with self-study.
2.22.20	One should not invite a person from the forest.
2.22.21	For the sake of fire, one should seek refuge.
2.22.22	In the sky, oneself.
2.22.23	On a bed or seat not spread out.
2.22.24	When new grain is obtained, one should allow the old grain.
2.25.9	Their residences, beds, food and drink should be provided according to their merits.
2.25.10	He should not live too long on the allowances of his preceptors and ministers.
2.25.11	In his kingdom, no one should suffer from hunger, disease, heat or cold, or should be deprived of anything, either intentionally or unintentionally.
2.25.12	In the middle of the assembly hall, he should place dice in pairs, made of Vibhitaka wood, and should throw them with a loud cry.
2.23.1	Or, if he wishes to observe a more extensive rule, he may collect alms every day with a bowl, in the evening and morning.
2.23.2	Then, living on roots, fruits, leaves, and grass, he should proceed, and finally resort to water, air, and space. The union of each succeeding one is superior to the preceding one in terms of fruit.
2.23.3	Now, two verses are cited from the Puranas:
2.25.13	The noble, the pure, and the truthful should be the gamblers.
2.25.14	The use of weapons, dancing, singing, and playing of musical instruments should not be found anywhere except in the service of the king.
2.25.15	A king who brings peace is one in whose realm there is no fear of thieves, whether in the village or in the forest.
2.23.4	The eighty-eight thousand sages who have gone to the path of the right, they have gone to the cremation grounds.
2.23.5	The eighty-eight thousand who have gone to heaven, they have gone by the path of the left.
2.23.6	Thus is the praise of the ascetics.
2.23.7	Now, even if they are accomplished through imagination.
2.26.1	The king who gives land and wealth to Brahmanas without harassing his servants, conquers the endless worlds.
2.26.2	The king who is killed while trying to conquer the wealth of Brahmanas, is said to be the sacrifice with himself as the sacrificial post and endless Dakshina.
2.26.3	By this, other heroes who fight for a cause and give up their lives are explained.
2.23.8	As the giving of progeny is like rain, and the other qualities are also appropriate,
2.23.9	Therefore, some people say that these stages of life are superior because they are the result of hearing and direct perception.
2.26.4	In villages and cities, he should appoint noble, pure, truthful, and virtuous persons to protect the people.
2.26.5	Those men would have such qualities.
2.26.6	A city should be protected from thieves for a distance of one yojana.
2.26.7	A village should be protected from them for a distance of a krośa.
2.26.8	If anything is lost there, it should be repaid by them.
2.26.9	He should collect taxes according to Dharma.
2.26.10	A brahmin is a tax-exempt person.
2.23.10	The Vedas are the authority for the learned in the three Vedas. The rites that are heard there, such as the connection with barley, rice, animals, ghee, milk, skull, and wife, and the rites of high and low, are considered to be the authority. The conduct contrary to those is considered to be the non-authority.
2.23.11	But what is called the cremation ground is the rite of the end of various rites, which is prescribed for the purification of the person.
2.26.11	All women of all castes.
2.26.12	And boys before they have reached puberty.

2.26.15	A Śūdra who has been initiated with the foot-touching rite.
2.26.16	Those who are blind, deaf, dumb, or afflicted with disease.
2.26.17	Those who have no use for their possessions.
2.23.12	Then after that, the fruit is heard to be endless and heavenly.
2.24.1	And even if he says that his birth is immortality, he says, "You are born after your offspring, that is your mortal and immortal."
2.24.2	And even if this very one is seen separately by direct perception, and similarity is also seen, the body is only different.
2.26.18	A young man who has intercourse with another man's wife or a girl without knowing it should be punished by words.
2.26.19	But if he does it knowingly with a wicked intention, he should be punished.
2.26.20	When there is a fight, the penis of the one who has a penis should be cut off along with the testicles.
2.26.21	But in the case of a girl, he should be killed after taking away his own.
2.26.22	Now, about the servant and the king:
2.26.23	And after that, the protection of the wife.
2.24.3	Those who are engaged in the remaining duties, by the merit of their ancestors, increase their fame and heaven.
2.24.4	Thus the lower and lower ones are of the higher ones.
2.24.5	They attain heaven till the end of the world.
2.24.6	In the future Puranas, they are said to be the seeds of the next creation.
2.24.7	But even then, it is said in the words of Prajapati:

2.24.9	Among them, those who commit sins perish, but they do not harm others, like a leaf of a tree.
2.26.24	But in the case of a helpless person, he may give it to his master.
2.27.1	In the case of a person who has gone abroad, the connection with Dharma is as before.
2.27.2	One should not tell others about a woman who belongs to the same family or caste.
2.27.3	They say that a woman is given to a family.
2.27.4	This is due to the weakness of the senses, and it is contrary to the scriptures.
2.27.5	For the hand is superior to the woman.
2.24.10	There is no connection of this with the acts in this world, nor with the fruits of acts in the other world.
2.24.11	This should be known by this.
2.24.12	This is the creation of Prajapati and the sages.
2.24.13	Among them, those who have done meritorious deeds, their natures are seen to be shining brightly.

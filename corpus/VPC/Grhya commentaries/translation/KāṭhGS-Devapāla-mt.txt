1.1	The word “vratas” means restraints and observances. The restraints are of the nature of prohibition of what is desirable, such as not eating meat, etc. The observances are of the nature that they complete the means of attaining the goal, such as living on alms, etc. The restraints are mentioned in the following verse: “Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-acceptance of gifts are the restraints” (Yoga Sutra 2.30). The observances are mentioned in the next verse: “Purity, contentment, austerity, study of scriptures, and devotion to God are the observances” (Yoga Sutra, 2.32). The restraints and observances mentioned there are also determined here as far as possible. One should be engaged in observing vows from the time of Upanayana (initiation) till the completion of Vedic studies.
1.2	The word “syāt” (may be) is to be applied to the following also. The difference between the path of the deer and the path of the bird will be stated later. “Vas” means covering, and “vasaḥ” means garment. And that is the deer-skin. One who has the path as his garment is called “mārga-vāsī”.
1.3	For, the act of cutting is the act of killing, not the instrument. The meaning is that the hair has been removed by a razor, not by a knife or other instrument. They say that there is repetition by the forthcoming statement, 'He who has his head shaved, or is matted-haired, or has a tuft of hair'. Or, it is said that he who has his hair in one form, i.e., in one form, is so. This is what is meant: 'He who has shaved his head, or is mat-ted-haired, has a tuft', this will be stated. There, for the purpose of removing the option of one of the three castes, the student, according to the difference of time, this is stated as a rule. The hair should be in one form only, i.e. in one form only. If he is matted-haied, he should not be shaven or have a tuft. Thus, in the case of shaving, etc.
1.4	The meaning of the word bhikṣā is a collection of alms. The teacher is one who has the characteristics mentioned in the verse beginning “One who initiates a disciple” (Manu 2.140). It is a rule that the celibate student should maintain his body only through alms. And his livelihood and maintenance depend on the teacher. The teacher may cause some people to give alms. Therefore, the teacher also has the livelihood and maintenance in the form of nourishing the student’s body, like other activities. Or, if alms are not obtained from elsewhere, the teacher himself gives food.
1.5	Here, even though the general statement is made, the stick is of palāśa wood, etc., as will be stated in due order, and the stick is present with the skin, and the one having the skin is the one having the stick. This is the implication.

1.6	The girdle is made of seven strands of Muñja grass, and is worn in three folds. Here, they explain the word "mekhala" as a garland of the male organ, because of the form "mayūravyaṃsakādi". It is indeed good, because "miha" means sprinkling, and "mihyate" means being sprinkled. The male organ is the organ of bliss, and above it, below the navel, is the male organ.
1.7	The prohibition of honey and meat is meant for those who are inclined to eat them for the sake of satisfaction. The story of the Ekīyas that the drinking of wine is prohibited for Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas is not correct, because there is no such inclination.

1.8	And that salt is of the kind called kṣāra, and is excluded from the use of the sāmudrika and other kinds of salt. He should use only the kind of salt called saindhava and sauvarchala, and should avoid all kinds of salt. Some say that he should avoid all kinds as well.
1.9	The meaning is that it is favorable.
1.10	Let there be study and other activities, but even mere action should not be done without the permission of the teacher. This is the meaning.

1.11-12	When the teacher is lying down, the student should get up first. When the teacher is sitting, the student should sit. When the teacher lies down, the student also lies down. The meaning of this is that when the teacher is sitting on a cot, the student should lie down on a lower seat, such as a mat or a bed. When the teacher sits on a bed, the student should also sit on a lower seat.
1.13	The student should give to his teacher the gold or other things that he may have received.
1.14	Although a celibate student may serve many teachers in due order for the sake of learning all the Vedas, Vedangas, and Upavedas, he should give to each teacher only what he wishes to give, and not everything to everyone.

1.15	The meaning is that the student should not sit on the bed on which the teacher is sitting, even with the teacher's permission, out of compassion or out of excess of affection, or out of carelessness. Thus there is no repetition by this of the statement "he should sleep in the lowest bed".

1.16	This is a prohibition of what is permitted. Others explain the sentence “ratha” as referring to the seat and vehicle occupied by the teacher, and the word “ratha” itself as referring to the horse and other vehicles. They also connect the second “na” in the sentence “na samvastrayet” with the first “na” by means of a series or by repetition, and explain the meaning as follows: “One should not mount the ratha, but if one is unable to go to the village etc. and does not get another vehicle, then one should mount the ratha occupied by the teacher with his permission.”
1.17	He should not wear the same clothes as his teacher. He should not wear clothes worn by his teacher. Nor should he keep his clothes in the same box or other container as his teacher's clothes.

1.18	All those acts which are done with the touch of the hand, such as holding, anointing, etc., should be avoided by him with all women. This is an exception to the Smrti that one should behave towards the wife and children of the Guru as towards the Guru himself. The exception is meant for acts like massaging the feet, etc.
1.19	The meaning is that one should not see a naked woman as if she were his own wife.
1.17	He should not wear the same clothes as his teacher. He should not wear clothes worn by his teacher. Nor should he keep his clothes in the same box or other container as his teacher's clothes.
1.20	The teacher should not speak of play, jokes, etc. for the purpose of play. Or, by saying “one is not independent in all activities”, when one is engaged in all activities after obtaining the teacher’s permission, the teacher says that one should not speak for the purpose of playing, urinating, and defecating, in order to obtain permission.

1.21	Ruci, Dipti, Rati, and Priti should not be taken as referring to a particular substance, etc. for that purpose. Ornamentation, play, etc. are not included.
1.22	Ruci is the purpose of this. It continues.

1.23	The meaning is this: Bathing is prohibited for the sake of beauty, but it must be done regularly. Because it is prescribed for Brahmachari also by the statement “Having bathed regularly, one should offer oblations to the sages and ancestors” (Manu 2.176). There is an option in that: bathing may be done sometimes with water sanctified by mantras, sometimes by sprinkling, sometimes by immersion. The former is stated here by saying “One should approach water”. With regard to immersion, it is said:

1.24	The word “yadi” (if) is used in the sense of a condition. The injunction is in the form of a statement. It is like “If one eats rice, then he should pour curd over it”, “If the Soma sacrifice is to be performed with the Rathantara Sama, then one should take up the Indra-Vayu grahas first”. Thus, the meaning is this: When the act of bathing is in the form dipping in water, then the Brahmachari should just move in the water with the staff. But for the sake of attaining beauty etc., one should not strive by removing impurities etc.
1.25-26	One who is shaven and has no hair on the head is called "Munda". The day is marked by the presence of the sun, the night is marked by the absence of the sun. The time marked by the sun rising half-way or setting half-way is called "sandhya". One should worship both the sandhyas every day. "Worship" means service. How does one worship? It is said:

1.27	He should stand facing the east, reciting the mantra, from the time when the sun has risen till the time when the light of the sun is visible.
1.28	He should sit facing the west, facing the setting sun, and recite the prayers from the time of the setting of the sun till the stars become visible. This is the prescribed way of worshipping the evening twilight.

1.29	This is merely an indication. Having risen at the Brahma Muhurta, having performed the body rites as prescribed, and remembering the words, “The body is extremely dirty, having nine holes, it flows day and night. The morning bath is purifying,” having performed the main or secondary bath, and remembering the statement, “Having sipped three times, wiped twice, touched the cavities, and purified with three Prāṇāyāmas, one deserves the Oṃkāra,” having performed the three Prāṇayāmas of fifteen mātrās as prescribed in Smṛti, and having performed the three Pranayāmas delimited by the repetition of the Savitri three times along with the seven Vyāhṛtis and the head, one should recite the Savitri along with the words, “Aghamarṣaṇa” and ending with the Sun worship, along with the three great Vyāhṛtis, “Bhūḥ, Bhuvaḥ, Svaḥ,” and the Savitri beginning with “Tatsavitur” which has been recited. The word “anvāha” means repetition. The words “Tatsavitura” are the symbol, even though the deity is Savitrī, it is for the purpose of excluding other Savitri verses beginning with “Ākṛṣṇena rajasā”.
1.30	When the sun has not set, one should go out of the village and collect eight green and moist kindling sticks for kindling the fire, if one desires prosperity in the form of Vedic study, its practice, and so on. This is indicated by the Veda, because Smriti is based on the Veda.

1.31	The going out of the village for the purpose of worshipping the sun at dawn and dusk is to be done. The begging for alms is to be done at dawn and dusk. For, it is said that eating is to be done twice a day. "As it is said, "The food of men at dawn and dusk was created by the gods" (Sanvarta, 1.12)." Thus, the kindling of the fire is to be done in both times. Four kindling sticks are to be offered in the morning, and four in the evening. These three statements are for the purpose of prescribing other specific times. The time before midday is morning, and the time after midday is evening.
1.32	"The opinion of some Vedic scholars is that the fire should be kindled in the evening." In this case, four kindling sticks should be brought.

1.32	"The opinion of some Vedic scholars is that the fire should be kindled in the evening." In this case, four kindling sticks should be brought.
1.33	This is only an illustration. There is a fault, a transgression, in not performing the morning and evening worship, in not eating almsfood, and in not kindling the fire, because of transgressing what is enjoined. As it is said, “He who does not rise for the morning worship, and who does not perform the evening worship, should be excluded like a Śūdra, from all the rites of the twice-born.” Now, when there is a failure in performing the morning and the evening worship, when one does not eat almsfood, when one does the Avakīrṇi vow as expiation for the sin that results from not doing so, and when one does not kindle the fire. Avakīrṇa means the voluntary emission of semen by a celibate student. The vow for one who has done this is prescribed thus: “He should beg for alms at seven houses, proclaiming his own duty. He should subsist on the alms obtained from them, eating only once a day. Bathing three times a day, he becomes purified in a year.” One who has not performed the morning and evening rites, etc., should perform the Avakīṇi vow. Is it to be performed for a full year? No, says the text, “for seven nights”. Others explain it thus: One who has not done the morning and evening rite, etc., for seven nights should perform the Avakiṇi vow for a full year. If it is less or more than seven nights, then it is less or excessive, says Yājñavalkya: “Having abandoned the begging and fire rites for seven nights, if one is not sick, one should perform the vow of the Niṣāda, the Garbha, and the Vaitat, and offer two oblations of ghee.” Here also the application is as before.
2.0	The duties of a student are mentioned in the section on kindling the sacred fires.
2.1	In the second section, "samid" is mentioned. The connection is made with "samidhamadadhati". The words "esho asi" and "edhi shimihi" are included. Similarly, with "samid asi" and "samedhi shimihi", and with "idam aham" and "bhava mihi". The fourth section is read completely.
3.0	The author states the limit of the vow of celibacy through the means of worshipping the preceptor.

3.0	The author states the limit of the vow of celibacy through the means of worshipping the preceptor.
3.1	The meaning of the Vedas, which are divided into the three classes of Mantras, Brāhmaṇas and Arthavadas, is to be learnt by one who is about to enter upon the life of a Householder, and who desires to take a wife, and who is desirous of learning the duties of a Snātaka. Having given his own wealth, he should honour the teacher, and then have the cow prepared for the Madhuparka offering. The cow thus prepared is to be given to the teacher. Some people say that the teacher gives the Madhuparka consisting of wine and meat to the pupil, and the pupil gives the Dakṣiṇā to the teacher. Others explain the cow as standing for the Madhuparka, and say that the pupil should have the cow prepared, and then have Madhuparka prepared for the teacher. The pupil, having received the Madhuparka, should honour the teacher with Dakṣiṇās, etc., according to his ability. Others again explain the text differently. The first half of the verse means that the pupil should learn the meaning of the Vedas and then have the Madhuparka prepared. The second half means that the pupil, having learnt from the teacher, should have the cow and the Madhuparka offered to the teacher. The teacher honours the pupil who has learnt from him, and then receives the Dakṣiṇa. The pupil, who has learnt from the teacher and received the Dakṣiņā, should honour the Teacher afterwards. Thus says Smṛti also—“One should honour the teacher who has come to him, who is wearing a garland, who is seated on a couch, who is the giver of the Brahma-gift, who is the son of his father, and who is the giver, with a cow.” The pupil who has learnt and received the Daksiṇā should bathe and then take a wife. The semen should not be emitted. The pupil should return after having given up the semen. Thus says the Śruti—“Indra lived the life of a Brahmacarin under Prajāpati. He returned after having given up his semen.” “The teacher is the Prajāpati of the Brahmacarin.” There are two kinds of Brahmacarins—the Upādhyāya and the Naisthika. The Upādhyāya is one who, having lived the life of the Brahmacarī, takes to the life of the Householder. The Naisthika is one who ends his life in the Brahmacarin stage. The text speaks of the Upādhyāya, because the duties of the Naisthikas are included in those of the Upādhya.
3.2	The other is the life-long student, the Vedic scholar. The word śrotriya is used in the sense of a Vedic scholar. The repetition of the word Vedic scholar is for the purpose of restriction. He is a Vedic scholar only, not one who performs the rites of bathing etc. His vow of celibacy lasts till death.
3.3	The meaning is that the one who is next to him, the one who is in the state of being a neophyte, does not have a bath. For the one who is undergoing the upanayana ceremony, who has a bath and so on, he says that there is a necessity for bathing.

The first half of the verse means that the pupil should learn the meaning of the Vedas and then have the Madhuparka prepared. The second half means that the pupil, having learnt from the teacher, should have the cow and the Madhuparka offered to the teacher. The teacher honours the pupil who has learnt from him, and then receives the Dakṣiṇa. The pupil, who has learnt from the teacher and received the Dakṣiņā, should honour the Teacher afterwards.

3.4	The village of cows is the village of cows, and the place occupied by it is the place occupied by the village of cows. The teacher who is the instigator of the act is directed thus: In the case of the matted hair, the matted hair is to be removed, and in the case of the tuft, the hair is to be cut. Having removed the matted hair etc., one should bathe, having sprinkled it with the three mantras beginning with "O water, thou art pure." One should bathe again with the two mantras "May the waters be auspicious" and "May the waters grant me peace." Here, by the mention of beard, the hair on the upper lip is also included. By the mention of hair, the hair on private parts is included, but not the hair on the eyebrows etc., as it would contradict the well-known practice of the noble ones. Then, having bathed thrice, having become sanctified, one should do this and that, says the text.

3.5-21	Here, since the order of the sūtras is stronger than the order of the words, the meanings of the mentioned and unmentioned words should be arranged in order according to their meanings. Thus, for one who has bathed three times and has emerged from a water body like a river, the washing of feet and other things are unmentioned, while the wearing of washed clothes and other things mentioned in the sūtras should be known in order. One should hold an umbrella with the mantra "The sky is your back..." according to one's ability. One should not give one's path to others. The practice of giving one's path is prohibited except for a specific purpose. The practice of going out through a door other than the one used for entering is prohibited. The practice of talking with a sweeper or one who wears dust is prohibited. The practices of sleeping with a menstruating woman, singing, and dancing in inappropriate places are prohibited. The practices mentioned in the sūtra "The sky is..." are explained here. The sky is your back, the earth is your seat, the atmosphere is your self, the ocean is your womb. Having seen with your eyes, stand forth and conquer the enemies. Those who desire the army, conquer them. O Agni, make this golden ornament for longevity and radiance. O Varuna, you also arrange the sharp strength properly. O Aditi, the mother of the gods, grant protection to this graduate, as if to a mother. O all gods, may the old and worn-out bodies be as they are. May they be as they are, means may they be as they should be. O gods, may the sandals be well-established, may they be well-established. Do not harm me.
3.5-21	Here, since the order of the sūtras is stronger than the order of the words, the meanings of the mentioned and unmentioned words should be arranged in order according to their meanings. Thus, for one who has bathed three times and has emerged from a water body like a river, the washing of feet and other things are unmentioned, while the wearing of washed clothes and other things mentioned in the sūtras should be known in order. One should hold an umbrella with the mantra "The sky is your back..." according to one's ability. One should not give one's path to others. The practice of giving one's path is prohibited except for a specific purpose. The practice of going out through a door other than the one used for entering is prohibited. The practice of talking with a sweeper or one who wears dust is prohibited. The practices of sleeping with a menstruating woman, singing, and dancing in inappropriate places are prohibited. The practices mentioned in the sūtra "The sky is..." are explained here. The sky is your back, the earth is your seat, the atmosphere is your self, the ocean is your womb. Having seen with your eyes, stand forth and conquer the enemies. Those who desire the army, conquer them. O Agni, make this golden ornament for longevity and radiance. O Varuna, you also arrange the sharp strength properly. O Aditi, the mother of the gods, grant protection to this graduate, as if to a mother. O all gods, may the old and worn-out bodies be as they are. May they be as they are, means may they be as they should be. O gods, may the sandals be well-established, may they be well-established. Do not harm me.
4.1	We shall explain the vow. The word “vow” is understood from the context. The vow that is mentioned in the four Vedas as lasting for forty-eight years is to be completed in one year. We shall explain that vow which is a substitute for the vow that is to be completed within forty-eight years. This vow is to be performed by one who has studied the four Vedas and whose vow prescribed for the time of study has not been completed. Therefore, this vow is called the Trividyaka vow. The purpose of mentioning this vow after the bath is that it is to be performed even by one who has become a Snataka, before marriage. Others explain that even when the vow prescribed for the prescribed time has been completed, this annual vow is to be done for the sake of attaining a higher degree of austerity. The word “atha” means the completion of the vow. As it is said, “The word ‘atha’ is remembered as having six meanings in auspicious occasions, completion, cause, and in the context of exceptions. It is also used in other contexts as appropriate.” The word “ataḥ” means cause. Since it is possible that some may not complete the vow prescribed for them during the time of study, therefore, we shall explain another vow which is a substitution for that vow.
4.2	The rest is self-evident.
4.3	The teacher should be taken as the basis for the rules regarding the places to sit and so on, which will be mentioned later. The practice of the qualities of the Vedas and the purpose of the practice should follow with the teacher as the principal.
4.4	One who is afraid of cold and heat and seeks shelter should not enter a hut or a house made of bamboo and reeds, etc., which are tied together, or a dwelling made of leaves, etc., which is specially made.
4.5-6	It is not only that he should not enter the special abode of others, but he should not even make his own abode. This is the meaning. If one thinks that there may be a fracture of the body due to the impact of wind, etc., then it is said: One should take refuge in a termite hill, etc.

4.7	Some say that the thread is the bamboo. Others say that the thread of the rope is the thread of the bamboo, which is different from the support of the sound produced by the bamboo struck by cold and other things, and which is stopped by the binding of the rope and other things.

4.8	The garment mentioned before is the same here. But there is this difference: Here the garment is made of wool or cotton, not of flax as is well known. Others say that it is made of wet and pounded darbha grass. The garment made of goat hair is called kuttapa. The measure of this garment is stated.
4.5-6	It is not only that he should not enter the special abode of others, but he should not even make his own abode. This is the meaning. If one thinks that there may be a fracture of the body due to the impact of wind, etc., then it is said: One should take refuge in a termite hill, etc.
4.9	The length of the garment should be from the chest to the upper part of the knees. This is the prescribed limit. It should be made of one piece of cloth. During the time of study, the lower part was made of Patol cloth and the upper part was made of leather. This is not mentioned in the world.

4.10	The time for eating is mentioned in the following verse of the Sanvarta-sutra: “The food of men is prepared by the gods in the evening and morning.” Here, the evening and morning of the first day are the two times, and the evening of the second day, excluding the morning, is the fourth time. Some say that one should eat and drink in the fourth time, i.e., one should eat at one time with a gap of one day. Others say that drinking means milk, buttermilk, etc., and that which is eaten in the fourth time is called “bhojya”. The word “bhoj” is seen in the case of drinkable things like milk, etc., as in the statement “One who eats water and eats air”.
4.11	He should not accumulate gold etc.

4.12	The collection of alms is bheksham. When the prohibition of accumulation of alms is obtained by the former, this is a counter-exception. One should eat alms every day. But for the sake of the body, one may eat only one alms, if unable to beg, one may accumulate only as much as is needed, such as molasses and grains. The word "but" is used with this intention.
4.13	When there is complete union of time and path, then the second day is from the word 'day', and one should sit on the second day, the meaning being that one should sit only above. One should sit at night, or sit down, or sleep when extremely tired, even occasionally in between, due to the absence of complete union. Therefore, there is no second day.
4.14	One should observe silence for both day and night. This is the vow of the sages.

4.15	Bhārgava Cyavana thinks that one should not speak to women etc. alone, but not to all. In the sense of one’s own, the Ni affix is used. “Rāma made the kingdom” like this. Those who are fallen, the three castes, the hasty, the speakers without being asked, such as Bhandavāṇḍi etc., and those who are menstruating, who smear their bodies with blood and make others give food etc.

4.16-17	This is meant for those who are incapable of performing the rites of the beginning and end of the year. One should perform the rites of fasting, sitting, and silence for twelve nights on both sides of the beginning and completion of the year. Thus, there are forty-eight days in the middle of the year. The beginning and end of each year are marked by two sets of twelve nights, twelve full moons, and twelve new moons.

4.18	The Palasha-wood is the substitute for the Palasha-wood which is always used by the Brahmachari-s. The Palasha- wood is the substitute for Palasha-wood. In the case of substitution, the trees connected with the Paridhi-wood are to be taken. The Paridhi-wood trees are the sacrificial trees. The Bilva, Khadira, Palasha, Rauhitika, Udumbara, Badhira etc. are the Paridhi- wood trees. The Brahmana and the Veda say: “The sacrificial post of the Soma sacrifice should be made of Bilva, Kha- dira, Palasha, or Rauhitika wood. The sacrificial post should be of Udumbara wood. One binds the sacrificial post with Khadira, Palasa, Rauhitika wood.” All the Paridhi-trees are sacrificial. It is heard in the Paridhi-Brahmana: “Indra brought the Paridhi-woods from the sacrificial trees.” Since the Palasha- wood trees are established as Paridhi-wood, they are mentioned separately. The word “always” is used here for the purpose of establishing the Palasha-woods as always used. It is said in the Sadya-satra: “When the middle post is established, the sacrificial post is performed.” It is said in Prakruti: “The sacrificial posts are performed in the Upa-sats.” When there is a doubt about the time, the Vikriti also takes the Prakruti. The Acharya has formulated the Sutra to make this meaning understood. The same is to be applied in other cases also because of the absence of contradiction. Therefore, one should know that the Palasha- woods are also to be used in the offering of Samit by the Aho-mugha-s. “Indra brought Paridhi-woods for the sacrificial trees.”

4.19	"He should do thus" is the remainder. With the two mantras beginning with "Medha, the great Angirasa..." and so on, he should perform the rubbing from above the navel up to the Brahma-door, which is the rubbing of the body. "One should rub above the navel with the hand" is remembered. In the morning Savana, midday Savana, and third Savana, in all three Savanas, and in all three parts of the night, one should perform the sprinkling of water thus. "Sprinkling, one attains well-being" is seen in the case of sipping water, touching, and bathing. It is not in the case of the penance for entering a river etc., which is established by the practice of good conduct. "Having sprinkled, they should offer Soma" is in the case of touching. "Having offered, they should sprinkle" is in the mere sipping of water. "One should sprinkle in a road etc." is in bathing. There, the determination of the specific case is based on the context, as in the case of words like "Saindhava". The water is pure always due to the conjunction of wind and sun during the day, the lunar wind at night, and the fire and wind at dusk. There, they say, having established the fire and placing gold. When the sun has set, like the taking of the Vasatīvari water, "Agni is indeed speech" is because of non-difference. Even in the case of difference, speech should be uttered. Thus, one should perform sipping water etc. at night also. Having bathed thus,

4.20	The relation is that one should perform the sprinkling with the four mantras ending with the word "namah" while offering oblations to these deities with water. Here the Sun alone, qualified by the limiting adjunct, is meant in the form of many deities. Thus the Sun is praised as the goer in the verse "Dramaham mamirgatau". The form of "ham" is "ham". The form of this is "himsa" in the instrumental case. It is Vedic. "Mohamaya" means "removing darkness". "Tapati" means "burning". "Tapas" means "burning and wandering". "Tapasa" means "one who burns". The Sun alone is praised in the form of Prajapati. "Tapyate" means "burning", which means the creation of the universe. "Tapanta" means "one whose creation is being produced". "Suno" means "one having a drop". "Vindate" means "one knows". "Vindate chetayate" means "Vindate". "Vindah" means "one causing agitation". "Vindah", in the form of the agitator, is Prajapati. Obeisance to him. "Vasundate" means "Vasundate". "Vasundate", in the same way, "Sarvasundate". There is a specific compound of these. "Paryatiri" means "one completing the action of crossing". "Paryanta" means "one crossing". "Paryantam tanute" means "Paryantam". "Urmyah" means "one deserving the waves of rays". "Surmya" means "one shining". "Chyavayati" means "Chyavana". "Bhrijjati" means "one cooking". "Bhargava" is the offspring of Bhrigu.
4.21	This is the vow of the student or the graduate, which has been prescribed for a year. Having performed it, he becomes free from the impurities of passion etc. and free from sin. In the demonstration of the absence of sin, it shows that this vow of a year is not the cause of expiation due to not performing the study prescribed for the purpose of study.
4.22	If he does not perform any other vow during the time of Vedic study, then when this substitute vow is performed, he becomes one who has performed the vow of all the four Vedas. The meaning is that he has performed the study of the four Vedas with the vow fulfilled. Those who describe this vow of a year as independent for the purpose of the excess of austerities of a Trividyak (one who has studied the three Vedas), they explain it thus: It is one sentence with the previous one. Having performed this vow of a full year, he becomes one whose vow is performed with all the Vedas. He becomes pure and free from sin, if he does not perform anything prohibited in between.

4.23	The word “tu” (but) indicates the inclusion of another fruit, and “khala” (indeed) indicates the certainty and the illumination of the Vedic nature. He purifies those whom he sees, even though they are not in a row, by the power of austerity. He also purifies those who are seated in a row but whom he does not see.

4.24-25	When this vow is completed, one offers oblations to the previously mentioned deities. The rice-based cooked rice offering is characterized by rice grains. The Suffixes are in accordance with the rule 'Chandasvat-sutra'. The word 'anna' is seen in the context of cooked, uncooked, and cooked-and-uncooked rice. In the context of uncooked rice, it is said 'One should perform the final rites with Heṣis for one desiring food'. In the context of cooked rice, it is 'One gives food, ghee, honey, and rice'. In the context cooked-and-ungcooked rice, it says 'One who eats food'. All three types of rice - cooked, uncooked and cooked-and uncooked - should be offered in sequence as appropriate. May the intellect be mine. The sages gave me intellect. Agni, Vayu, and Dhātar gave me intellect. May Varuna, Agni, Indra, and Surya give me intellect. May the goddess Sarasvati, the intellect that exists among the celestial nymphs and Gandharvas, and the mind that exists there, enter me here in this human body. May my body be wise, may my speech be sweet. May the three forms of Sarasvati yield sweetness to me. May I listen to what I have heard and understood. May what I have not spoken be pleasing to me. May it spread among my disciples and their disciples, ending with fruits. May I be able to speak what I wish to say. May we be devoted to learning. May the goddess be inclined to give us the fruits of learning. May we be united with her.
5.1	The person who believes in the evil done by him and in the practice of what is prohibited and not to be done is called Kṛcchra. Gautama also says: “Having performed these three Kṛcchras, one becomes purified in all the Vedas, in all the Tīrthas.” The three are Kṛcchra, Mahākṛcchra, and Taptakṛcchra. The meaning of Kṛcchra is either believing in the evil done or destroying it. The word Kṛcchra has lost its case-ending due to Vedic usage. The Carāyana Sūtra also says: “Purukṛte chashchhreyoḥ.” The words Puru and Kṛta have lost their case-ending. The meaning of the word Kṛcchram is either covering or destroying. It is also known as difficult to cross, dense, difficult, and hard. The meaning of this word is also understood from the script. The meaning of “I shall explain the Kṛcchravidhi” is that this statement is meant to attract the attention of the disciples. The same should be followed in other cases. For the purpose of praising and for his own sake, he states the Purākalpa discourse of this vow.

5.2	The meaning is that the vow of the gods etc. is praised here because it was practiced by the gods etc. for the purpose of liberation from sin. The gods themselves are the gods. The gods etc. practiced in such a way, we shall describe that way.
5.3	One should not converse with a woman or a Śūdra alone while performing the Kṛcchra.
5.4	He should sleep at night, resting on a wall or a piece of wood, only to relieve fatigue, and not to sleep. Thus his austerities become excessive.

5.5	He should stand throughout the day, not sit.
5.6	This shows that even a householder has the right to practice celibacy.

5.10	This vow is for the destruction of all the evil deeds committed in this life, as well as those committed in the past life, just as it is for the destruction committed during the time of study.

5.11	This is to be known as the Marut-vrata. For three days one should eat in the evening after the time of the Homa; for three days in the morning; for three days one should subsist on alms; for three days on fasting. Thus in order, this Vrata of Kṛcchra lasts for twelve days. This is explained as the Prājāpatya Vrata. Thus, any other Vrata which is accomplished by suffering is called Kṛcchra, such as the Kūrcānta-pana etc. Here, while indicating the Ati-Kṛcchra type, it is said:
5.8	The following passages are found in the Veda: “Honey is not defiled if taken without desire.” “Salt is not defiled.” “If one gives to gods and Brahmins and eats meat, he is not defiled” “One should carefully feed the grandson who is observing a vow at a śrāddha.” One should avoid honey etc. with special effort here in the vow, without considering the above scriptures.
5.12	The method of Atikṛcchra is the same as that of Kṛcchra, as mentioned in the above section. If this were the case, there would be no scope for the injunction of Atikṛcchrā, as it would be the same as Kṛcchra. To address this concern, the text says "thus it is enjoined" and "there is a difference". Thus it is said.
5.9	The skin of a cow, the skin of a cow with a fringe, the skin of an antelope, the skin of the head of a deer, the skin of deer, the skin that is said to be made of antelope skin.
5.13	The meaning is that there is a special rule regarding eating. Thus, one should eat one mouthful at each of these times, evening and so on, while practicing extreme austerity. As for the size of the alms, it is as long as the mouthful remains in the mouth without changing. Eating by filling the hands is called "alms-food".
5.10	This vow is for the destruction of all the evil deeds committed in this life, as well as those committed in the past life, just as it is for the destruction committed during the time of study. The wind gods and others also performed this vow for the same purpose. This is a strong proof that they are not deluded.
6.1-2	In times of distress, such as at sunset, etc., one should drink hot water, milk, ghee, and eat only what is begged for three days. One should subsist on air alone for the sake of purity and to sustain the body, and not eat or drink anything else. This is the prescription for three severe fasts.
6.3	The name of the Kurch is derived from the name of Brihaspati. The name Kurch is used in the sense of recommending. The mode of sitting and lying down in the Kurch has been mentioned. The word tu has a different order in the sense of also. It says something different from the previous one.
5.11	This is to be known as the Marut-vrata. For three days one should eat in the evening after the time of the Homa; for three days in the morning; for three days one should subsist on alms; for three days on fasting. Thus in order, this Vrata of Kṛcchra lasts for twelve days. This is explained as the Prājāpatya Vrata. Thus, any other Vrata which is accomplished by suffering is called Kṛcchra, such as the Kūrcānta-pana etc. Here, while indicating the Ati-Kṛcchra type, it is said:
5.12	The method of Atikṛcchra is the same as that of Kṛcchra, as mentioned in the above section. If this were the case, there would be no scope for the injunction of Atikṛcchrā, as it would be the same as Kṛcchra. To address this concern, the text says "thus it is enjoined" and "there is a difference". Thus it is said.
6.4	The barley-gruel is prepared with barley and wheat, and is mostly used as a drink. The barley-gruels are of two kinds, one is hard and the other soft. The vegetables are only those that are fit for sacrifice. In the case of eating in this manner, the Kṛcchra and other restraints should be observed in the evening. The water with Kuśa-grass is to be used together, as is indicated by the copulative compound. Thus there are seven Tri-days.
5.13	The meaning is that there is a special rule regarding eating. Thus, one should eat one mouthful at each of these times, evening and so on, while practicing extreme austerity. As for the size of the alms, it is as long as the mouthful remains in the mouth without changing. Eating by filling the hands is called "alms-food".
7.1	The remaining part of the sentence is "We shall explain the rules for Kṛcchra". The word "atha" indicates a separate section from the previous ones.
7.2	Here, the Homa is to be offered only to the Maruts, and they alone are to be propitiated with water. Both these acts are to be done after bathing.
7.3	The Kṛcchra-sāntapana is the form of Kṛcchra. It is the Kṛcchra and Sāntapana combined. Drinking of Kuśa water, cow's urine etc. on one day, fasting for one night, thus seven nights.
6.1-2	In times of distress, such as at sunset, etc., one should drink hot water, milk, ghee, and eat only what is begged for three days. One should subsist on air alone for the sake of purity and to sustain the body, and not eat or drink anything else. This is the prescription for three severe fasts.
6.3	The name of the Kurch is derived from the name of Brihaspati. The name Kurch is used in the sense of recommending. The mode of sitting and lying down in the Kurch has been mentioned. The word tu has a different order in the sense of also. It says something different from the previous one.
6.4	The barley-gruel is prepared with barley and wheat, and is mostly used as a drink. The barley-gruels are of two kinds, one is hard and the other soft. The vegetables are only those that are fit for sacrifice. In the case of eating in this manner, the Kṛcchra and other restraints should be observed in the evening. The water with Kuśa-grass is to be used together, as is indicated by the copulative compound. Thus there are seven Tri-days.
7.1	The remaining part of the sentence is "We shall explain the rules for Kṛcchra". The word "atha" indicates a separate section from the previous ones.
7.2	Here, the Homa is to be offered only to the Maruts, and they alone are to be propitiated with water. Both these acts are to be done after bathing.
7.4	This is the same as the Sāntapana, which becomes the Mahāsāntapana when practised three times in the proper order by eating cow-urine etc. or by the method of Danda-kalana. By this method, the Sāntapan comes to an end in seven days and the Mahāsātantana in twenty-one days. This is a great penance. But if it is understood that the Sāntapaṇa lasts for two days and the Mahasāntapana for seven days in the Yājñavalkya, then it is imagined only for another person in view of the need for the special capacity of choice. Because all Smṛtis are authoritative. Therefore, there should not be the trouble of curtailing everywhere by this much. There, the statement of Yājñavlkya is: “One should drink the five products of the cow, i.e., cow’s milk, curd, urine, and then fast on the next day while practising Sāntapāna.” (3.314) By this, the use of the five products of cow etc. is stated on one day, and fasting on the second day. Because it says about the Mahāsānta-pana: “The six days with fasting separately by the Sāntpana substances, this Kṛcchra is known as Mahāsāntpana in seven days.” (3. 315) Here, because of the separate use of the five cow products etc., there are six days, and fasting on seventh day.
7.3	The Kṛcchra-sāntapana is the form of Kṛcchra. It is the Kṛcchra and Sāntapana combined. Drinking of Kuśa water, cow's urine etc. on one day, fasting for one night, thus seven nights.
8.0	All the Kṛcchra-vratas are to be performed for twelve days, and the twelve-day vow is the principal one. Hence the Mantras and other rites pertaining to the twelve-day Vow are to be employed here, as subordinate to the rites of the Kṛcchras. This is the idea underlying the statement of the special features of the Kṛcchrā-vratas.
8.1	Of all these austerities, the method of undertaking the one that has been mentioned first, and the rules of conduct in connection with it, are described as beginning with the Dvādaśāha (twelve-day) rite; and the method of abandoning it is to be known from that itself.
8.2	In the first Trirātra, having bathed near the fire, one should take the vow with the mantras beginning with "Vasavas, the lords of vows, I have taken the vow. I tell you that. I am able to do that." Thus, at the end of the vow, the relinquishment of the vow should be done with the mantras "Vasavas, lords of vows, the vow I have performed, I am unable to do that. I tell you. Protect me." Thus, having taken the vow with these four mantras, one should offer oblations to the Vasus with water daily in the first Trirāatra, to the Rudras in the second, to the Adityas in the third, and to the Maruts and Angiras in the fourth Trirātra with water.
7.4	This is the same as the Sāntapana, which becomes the Mahāsāntapana when practised three times in the proper order by eating cow-urine etc. or by the method of Danda-kalana. By this method, the Sāntapan comes to an end in seven days and the Mahāsātantana in twenty-one days. This is a great penance. But if it is understood that the Sāntapaṇa lasts for two days and the Mahasāntapana for seven days in the Yājñavalkya, then it is imagined only for another person in view of the need for the special capacity of choice.

There, the statement of Yājñavlkya is: “One should drink the five products of the cow, i.e., cow’s milk, curd, urine, and then fast on the next day while practising Sāntapāna.” (3.314) By this, the use of the five products of cow etc. is stated on one day, and fasting on the second day. Because it says about the Mahāsānta-pana: “The six days with fasting separately by the Sāntpana substances, this Kṛcchra is known as Mahāsāntpana in seven days.” (3. 315) Here, because of the separate use of the five cow products etc., there are six days, and fasting on seventh day.
8.3	In the first three days, the offering should be made to Vasus with two mantras and a cake in the worldly fire by a student and a graduate, or in the sacrificial fire or in the domestic fire by a householder.
8.4	The offering should be made in the second three days.
8.5	This is for the third three days.
8.0	All the Kṛcchra-vratas are to be performed for twelve days, and the twelve-day vow is the principal one. Hence the Mantras and other rites pertaining to the twelve-day Vow are to be employed here, as subordinate to the rites of the Kṛcchras. This is the idea underlying the statement of the special features of the Kṛcchrā-vratas.
8.6	On the fourth day, the Homa of the Maruts and the Angiras should be performed daily according to the appropriate mantras. This is the meaning.
8.1	Of all these austerities, the method of undertaking the one that has been mentioned first, and the rules of conduct in connection with it, are described as beginning with the Dvādaśāha (twelve-day) rite; and the method of abandoning it is to be known from that itself.
8.2	In the first Trirātra, having bathed near the fire, one should take the vow with the mantras beginning with "Vasavas, the lords of vows, I have taken the vow. I tell you that. I am able to do that." Thus, at the end of the vow, the relinquishment of the vow should be done with the mantras "Vasavas, lords of vows, the vow I have performed, I am unable to do that. I tell you. Protect me." Thus, having taken the vow with these four mantras, one should offer oblations to the Vasus with water daily in the first Trirāatra, to the Rudras in the second, to the Adityas in the third, and to the Maruts and Angiras in the fourth Trirātra with water.
9.1	Here, the relation is to be connected with what is going to be said, 'Desiring the relation of the pupils'. Whatever is remembered as an accessory of study and teaching, that should be mentioned. And the initiation is also an accessory of study, and teaching. Thus, from 'Desiring the union of the pupils', the relation of the student with the fruit is understood. And from 'For him who desires this, for life', the fruit is understood without distinction of both the pupil and the teacher, from the mantra and the initiation employed by the teacher. There, the observances are stated for the purpose of accomplishing the state of being a triple-knower. And the residence of the pupil with the teacher is desired for the purpose of learning the main and subsidiary branches. And the Smriti says, 'Even one who has learned the arts should reside for some time in the teacher's house, as a pupil. The months of Sravan and Bhadra are the rainy season. There, the initiation should be done at the very first Sravan constellation, because there is no reason for abandoning the first. By the method, 'The first may be regulated, or there would be a reason for transgression', what is done by the pupil who desires the relation of the teacher and the pupil, who desires the relation with the teacher for the purpose of teaching the main and subsidiary subjects, and who desires the relation for the sake of the superior knowledge of the pupils? This is explained by the fruit.
8.3	In the first three days, the offering should be made to Vasus with two mantras and a cake in the worldly fire by a student and a graduate, or in the sacrificial fire or in the domestic fire by a householder.
8.4	The offering should be made in the second three days.
8.5	This is for the third three days.
8.6	On the fourth day, the Homa of the Maruts and the Angiras should be performed daily according to the appropriate mantras. This is the meaning.
9.2	He offers with the verses beginning with "Apā is thy name" and others. The other three verses are connected with the first verse beginning with "Tasyāste" due to the capability of completing the sentence. The connection is the completion of the sentence in all cases due to the equality of eligibility. Thus, there are three sentences beginning with "Rantir nāma asi, Tasyāste". The entire reading is from a different branch.
9.3	He who desires to attain the state of a yogi should be devoted to his teacher.
9.4	The mantra "Dadhikravan" is repeated only once for the consumption of curd. The Savitri mantra is repeated three times, as it is dedicated to the deity Savitar. The mantra "Tastvaritara" and others are very powerful and not others like "Aakrishna na rajasa". The three chapters beginning with "Ise tva" are the first, the second beginning with "Devasyatva", and the third beginning with "Vasoh pavitram asi". The question "Who yokes thee?" is employed in the horse sacrifice for the purpose of joining the boundary. The repetition of both is implied.
9.5	The time when the teacher is teaching and the pupil is studying is called the time of study.
9.6	The time when the teacher and the pupil are not teaching and studying is called the non-study time. The non-study time is limited to the present time. The nonstudy time is when lightning flashes and thunder roars.
9.7	The word ākalika is used in the sense of the same time. If the beginning and the end are the same, then the word ākalika has been used in the statement 'In the statement of ākalika and daiyant, the letter ka is for the purpose of feminine gender' (Pāṇini 5.1.114). The letter ka is for feminine gender. The lightning is ākalika. The time of beginning is the same as the time of destruction of the lightning. Similarly here also, the time of the beginning of the Devatumula etc. when the first blow of the bell is struck is the same as its end on the second day. This is what is meant by the word ākalikā. This means that the Devatumulas etc. arise in as much time as is required for the study on the second day, and there is no study in between. Those who connect the word ākalikä with the statement 'Not when lightning flashes, not when thunder roars, it is ākalika' and explain that there is no study for as much time as the Devatumala etc. last, they are told later that the study for a day and night is to be done by the word, and the repetition of what is obtained by the statement of the present is a repetition. There is the Devatumila created by Gandharvas etc. in the form of singing and playing instruments in the sky. The lightning is meant here as the lightning strike during the time of study for a day or night. The word 'bow' is also used for the rainbow, and the temporary nature of the rains is well-established except during the rainy season. The fall of a big meteor is also meant by the word 'meteor'. The word 'meteor' is also used in the case of a star falling.
9.8	Other causes of non-study are mentioned in the chapter on conduct, such as earthquakes, eclipses of the sun and moon, the death of kings and great men, etc.
9.9	The words that are beyond the prescribed limit are called ati-akshara. They are like the sounds of thunder, huṃkāra, and slapping. The continuous flow of saliva is also ati-aksharas. But it is not just the flow of saliva, because it is mostly present. These two are the causes of untimely non-study.
9.10	Those who have half of five months are the half-fifth months, which are four and a half. Similarly, the half-sixth months are the half fifth months, which are five and a half. Having studied according to the prescribed method, having performed the study which is the cause of the purpose of study, having taught, i.e., having instructed, he abandons the chapters, meaning he makes the resolution of abandonment. And there is no abandonment of Vedic study, or from the special days of non-study. He mentions the connection with the two mantras beginning with "We abandon".
9.11	This is another exception. The new moon day and the fourteenth day are exceptions because they are on both sides of the fortnight. Although the two full moon days and the two new moon days are mentioned in the chapter on conduct as having the fourteenth day, the mention again is for the purpose of prescribing the first day. It is said, “The mention again is for a secondary purpose.”
10.1	The disciples are meant. The Upanisads are meant for those who are fit to study them, after the preliminary rites of the teacher and the pupil, and in the course of their study. The Upanisad-fit pupils are meant, such as the lifelong celibate students and others.
10.2	One who is a celibate, one who is endowed with the vow of celibacy, one who has good conduct, one who is intelligent, one who is capable of grasping and retaining, one who performs rites, one who is devoted to performing the obligatory and occasional rites, one who performs the service of the teacher, one who is generous, one who is able to make abundant gifts, one who is at the end of the rite of initiation, not before, because it is prohibited, as it is said, “One who knows Dharma should not do anything for the teacher before” (Manu 2.2), one who is dear, one who is always virtuous, one who desires another knowledge through knowledge, those are the sacred places of Brahman, the means of giving and grasping the secret form of the Veda. A sacred place is known as a watering hole. Those who have good understanding desire three things: the sacred place, the watering hole, and the water frequented by sages.
11.1	The author will describe the Agnihotra rite in the next chapter. This is mentioned here in order to show that it is connected with the Agnihotra rite. One who desires to marry a woman who is a co-religionist should make her take refuge in a particular place. What kind of place should be made? It should be a place near the southern gate or the western gate, or a new place, made of wood and other materials not previously used. A place where the ground is even, without any high or low points. A place where there are roots of trees and flowers suitable for play. A place where water flows evenly, meaning that when water is poured there, it flows evenly and does not flow unevenly. A place where it is not too much inclined, meaning that it is not too inclined towards the east or the west. A place where if water flows evenly, it means that it flows evenly. A place where, if water flows evenly and does then flow unevenly, it means that the water flows evenly. A person should make a woman take refuge in a place where water flows unevenly, meaning that if water flows evenly towards the east or west, it means that water flows unevenly.
11.2	The hole is the place where the post is to be fixed. The post is to be placed in the hole. Having spread the darbha grass with their tips pointing towards the east or the north and arranged in the shape of a svastika, the middle post is to be inserted into the darbha grass which is the base. In the act of inserting, the following three mantras are recited: "O post, having made you firm and strong, I am inserting you into the hole. You are indeed the wife of immortality, the one who protects. Therefore, stand securely. What are you doing? You are giving away ghee. By taking ghee, all prosperity is indicated. Since you are like this, we wish to enter you, O post. Having entered, we wish to be dependent on your house in this life. May all of us be heroic, having many sons, very heroic, having good sons, and free from harm, having sons who are not harmed. O post, may you be adorned with immortality, being indestructible. May you grow and become like this: having horses, being connected with horses, having cows, being connected with the men of the house of immortality. May you have the true Vedic rites such as sacrifices. May you be energetic, nourishing strength. May you be having milk, having milk. May you make our house full of all prosperity." Therefore, it is said: "O post! May you turn towards us with milk." O post! May you be turned towards us with milk. May the young boy enter you, and the calf also enter you. The singular form is used in the place of the plural form. The pot of milk that has flowed out from the womb and other places of the moving world is covered. This pot of curd enters with the pots of curd.
11.3	The mantra is said to be "O you who are the central pillar, O you who are the king of the central pillar, with truth and with the form of the protector, you ascend the pillar. Stand above the pillar. What kind of? Fierce, being invincible, shining with distinction, and repelling others, destroy the enemies who are the cause of obstruction to our position. And then, after you, the lord of the house, are established, we ourselves will become wealthy, having many sons, and possessing wealth, by offering oblations every day. We ourselves are your own. The word "iti" indicates the completion of the mantra. The central pillar and the central pillar are employed in the mantra. The other pillars and pillars are recommended to ascend silently without mantra.
11.4	The text says, “One should erect the beam pointing eastwards.” And, “One should make the door facing east or south.” In this context, if the door is made to face east, then the beam should be erected with its tip pointing towards the east. This sutra is meant to convey this meaning. The erection means the proper fixing of the beam on the wall.
12.1	Then, when the marriage has been performed and the fire has been introduced into the marriage fire, the householder should enter the house. What should he do before entering? He should offer a cooked meal to Vastospati. Vastospati is the presiding deity of the house. The word 'Vastospati' is formed by adding the suffix 'sup' to 'muru' and then applying the rule of 'alunga'. Having offered the cooked meal to Vastosapati, he should enter the house, either by the relation of parts to the whole, or by the relation of the parts to the whole. For the sake of the disciples, he recites four verses beginning with "These are the bearers" and ending with "By the four". "These are the carriers, O Vastospati, entering all forms, be a good friend to us. O Vastospati! Accept us, be our own, be free from disease. Whatever we offer to you, accept that. Be auspicious to us, be auspicious to the bipeds and the quadrupeds. O Vastospater, be our protector, the one who removes darkness, the one who has cows and horses, the one who is free from old age in your friendship. Be like a father to us, O Vastospater! By what prosperity do you serve him? May we also obtain that. By what prosperity, O Vastospate, may we obtain that? By what prosperity, the auspicious, the golden, the singing, do you serve him?" And whatever excellent thing we have obtained through your grace, protect that. What does he do? He is engaged in the yoga of obtaining what was not obtained and in protecting what was obtained.
12.2	In that house, he should feed Brahmins. The name of that rite is 'Vamśodvīkṣaṇika' (i.e., looking at the family). They eat looking at the family.
13.1	The Pañcagni-sacrifice is to be performed after the marriage-ceremony. The Pañcagnis are so called because they are performed with five fires.
13.2	The singular number is used here in the context of the plural number, to indicate that the four sacrifices are of one kind, just as the eye and other senses are of one kind. The four sacrifices are mentioned by Gautama in the following verse: “The eight-day sacrifice, the Parvan-shraddha, the Sravanya, the Agrahayani, the Chaitryani, and the Ashvayuji.” The six sacrifices are mentioned in the following verse of the same text: “The six sacrifices are the Paka-yajnas.” The Huta sacrifice is performed by offering oblations to the gods. The Ahuta sacrifice is performed without offering oblations, such as the offering of food to the ancestors. The Prahuta sacrifice is performed at the beginning of a ritual, such as the Anvashtas. The Prashita sacrifice is performed by feeding guests and Brahmins. All these sacrifices are performed with the intention of offering substances to the gods.
13.3	The remainder is the natural. The Vedic Homa of the offerings made here is the natural. From that, the rites are derived. That which is followed is the natural. That which follows is the artificial. Thus, in the Vaishvadeva, the rites of gathering, sprinkling, spreading, offering with Svāhā, and throwing the food are performed.
13.4	The Vedic offering is the nature of the offerings here. Having spread the sacrificial grass and having performed the invocation, having offered garlands and fragrances, having offered incense, and having arranged the oblations, this is the procedure.
13.5	The Vedic Piṇḍapitṛyajña is the natural rite for the departed ancestors of this country, because it is the receiving of the Piṇḍa which is the remnant of the Vaiśvadeva rite. The Mantras used in the Piṇḍapitृyajña, and the acts of eating and sitting, etc., are transferred to it.
13.6	The two kinds of meals are those given to guests and those given to Brahmins. The Vedic Madhuparka offered to guests is the natural form. The Vidhi ends with the statement that the meal should be mainly of meat, preceded by offering of water for washing the feet, Arghya and Madhuparka to the Brahmins. In the case of offering meals to Brahmins with reference to a particular deity, the Brahmau-dana prescribed in the Agnihotra is the natural form, and the Vidhi ends with statements like “Let them eat” after the permission to eat.
13.7-8	This is a general injunction. The special injunctions are shown in the previous section. When the Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa sacrifices are enjoined without any distinction, the exception is stated in some cases. The performance of the Avṛt rite, the performance of the Upacāra rite, and the performance of the silent rite of pouring down and striking are meant. The meaning is that the performance of the rites of pouring down and hitting silently is without mantras.
13.9	That which is of no use, though seen in the original rite, should not be performed in the modified rite; e.g., the mortar and the covering, which are of no use in the cooking of rice, though seen in it. Similarly, the placing of the Samit wood is not to be done, because the Samit wood has been omitted, and because there is no Prayāja offering. The absence of the Samit-wood and other things will be explained by the enumeration (of the offerings). And by this much, the Pañcayajña rites do not become new, like the Darvihoma, Grihamedhya, etc. It is not to be said that it is said to be the original of the Darsha-Pūrṇamāsa, because it is based on the Dhruvāhoma and other rites.
14.1	The time for searching for a wife after bathing is indicated by the words 'one should bathe and then obtain a wife'. The wife deserves to be supported, hence the affix ṇyaṭ is added to the root 'arha' (to deserve) in the sūtra 'arhe krityatṛcśca' (3.3.169). It means 'to find, to obtain, to see'. When the sun moves from the southern direction to the northern direction during the Udgayana (northern solstice), it is called Uttarāyaṇa. The sūtra mentions the asterisms.
14.2	And the Krittikā and Svāti and the eastern ones, one should choose from them, one should employ, but one should not choose oneself. This shows the propriety of the optative.
14.3	The one who knows the characteristics of the hand and other parts should examine the auspicious characteristics. The order of meaning should be known according to the order of reading, because the order of reading is stronger. The selection is preceded by the examination of characteristics. When the characteristics are not obtained, another means of examination is stated.
14.4	The word 'api' (even) indicates the acceptance of other means. The word 'va' (or) indicates option. One should examine the fortunes with the help of the lumps. The meaning is that the means of pleasing the husband mentioned earlier are not obtained.
14.5	The altar is well known as the place for sacrifices. The ground dug up by a plough is called Sītā. A pond is a reservoir of water, such as a lotus-pond, etc. A cow-pen is a place where cows are kept. The place where gambling is done is called Ādahanam. The place where dead bodies are burnt is called Śmaśānam. The place where four roads meet is called Catuṣpatham. The place where there is no grass is called Iriṇam. One should take a lump of earth from each of these places and also from the ninth place, which is the place where all the lumps are collected together. The meaning is that one should collect a small amount of earth from each place, such as the altar, etc., and make the ninth place where all the collected lumps are kept. The mantra for taking the lumps of earth from the places such as the altar is given as "Rtam eva". The word "iti" means "in this way". Prajāpati is the supreme lord. He does not transgress or go beyond the truth. Therefore, he should be present here and illuminate the truth. This earth, which is in the form of the altar, etc. is supported by the truth. When it is said "this", one should understand it as referring to the maiden. The maiden is called "the one who is present in the form of Śobhāvatī, etc." because she is present in a direct manner. This is the fifth verse on the illumination of truth.
14.6-8	If he takes one of the four kinds of women mentioned in the Vedas, namely, the one from the sacrificial altar, the one from Sita, the one from a cowpen, and the one from a pond, then he should marry her. But he should avoid the one who takes others. For the woman from the sacrificial altar helps in the accomplishment of the meaning of the Vedas, the one from Sitā is fertile, the one from cowpen is suitable for cows, the one from pond is suitable for flowers and ornaments, and gives satisfaction, and is the cause of the caitya, and makes the husband live. The widow is certainly in the cremation ground, the one who loves gambling is in the gambling ground, the one always tormented is in the desert, and the one scattered is in the crossroads.
14.9	The word "manyante" is to be supplied. The meaning is that one should accept the bride on the auspicious days as mentioned in the Jyotish Shastra.
14.10	Upayam means acceptance. The meaning is these are the auspicious stars.
14.11	The meaning is that one has to follow the auspicious days as stated in the Jyotih Shastra.
15.1	The marriage which is given according to the Brāhma rite is called Brāhma-deya. We shall describe the procedure of the excellent gift. The word “atha” means “now”. There are eight kinds of marriages: Brāhma, Daiva, Ārṣa, Prajāpati, Asura, Gāndharva, Rākṣasa and Paiśāca. Among them, the procedure of the six marriages except Brāhma and Asura is well-known and does not deserve to be mentioned here. Therefore, the procedure of only Brāhma and Āsura marriages is mentioned. Thus, the Rākṣasa marriage is where there is forcible abduction. What is the use of mentioning the procedure there? Similarly, the Paiśāca marriage is where there are no mutual consent. It is also not mentioned because it is extremely sinful. The Gāndharava marriage is where there occurs union between one who desires and one who desires. Here also, the procedure is that one should not deviate from Dharma, Artha and Kāma. The procedure of Prajāpati marriage is well-known. The girl is given to the priest after adorning her within the altar. This is said to be the Daiva marriage by the Smṛti-writers. The procedure of the Ārṣa marriage is that one should give the girl to the one who desires her along with a pair of cows.
15.2	On the auspicious day of the bright fortnight, which is pure according to astrology, on a festival day or the full moon day, having spread darbha grass with the tips towards the north for the purpose of purification on a special mat, the giver and receiver should sit facing east. The receiver should be of what kind? Accompanied by his ministers and attendants. The giver, on the other hand, should sit facing west, and likewise the ministers, having spread darbh grass with the tips pointing north.
15.3	The officiating priest, seated in the southern direction facing the north, should make the connection between the giver and the receiver. Having done what? Having placed Darbha grass with its tips towards the east and its roots towards the north between the giver and receiver, and having placed a vessel of water on those Darbha grasses, and having placed rice and barley in that water, then the water is placed. Since the statement "water is placed" is general, how is the vessel obtained? Because it is seen in "gold is placed in the vessel" (16.5).
15.4	When the giver and receiver and their relatives have assembled, the priest should say, “The giver should say, ‘This girl is being given to him.’ The receiver should say, ‘The girl is being received from him.’ Then the priest should say three times, ‘I give it to you, I give it to you.’ The giver should also do the same. The receiver should say to the priest, ‘I receive it thus.’ The scriptural statement is, ‘The gods are true three times.’ It is well known that what is said three times does not deviate. Therefore, it is said that when they have assembled, they should do it. When the girl is given and received in the presence of many people, she cannot be taken away or abandoned.”
15.5	May your gift and acceptance be true and unfailing. With the words of the world, the priest recites the two verses "May your intentions be the same" and "May your minds be the same", looking at both the giver and the receiver. May your intentions be equal, may your minds be the equal, may your thoughts be the same, so that you may all be happy. May your minds be united, may your vows be united, may the thoughts be united, those who are separated, we do not bow to them. O giver and receiver! May your intentions be equal and united, may your minds and thoughts be the same and equal, so that no one may have any evil intention, such as stealing someone's daughter. May your minds be the samne, and I make them so for you by reciting this. May your minds come together so that you may be happy. Thus, may your minds come together, and may your thoughts come together. Those among you who are separated and have contrary conduct, some say "you", others say "these". Those who are seen to have bad conduct by their facial expressions and other signs, may they be separated. We do not bow to those who are separated. The word "neti" is added. We do not bend to them. We make them always follow good conduct.
16.1	The rule of giving is stated. This is the remainder. What is given with a fee, that is given with a price.
16.2	When gold is given by one to another for the purpose of conquest, then both the giver and the receiver become Asuras, because of their greed for gold, and because of the predominance of the Dasyus in their desire for conquest. Therefore, it is praised that they engage in mutual service. But when gold, which is the price of a bride, is given by one who is giving it away and received by one who is receiving it, then both the receiver and the giver are understood to have two purposes through the treatise.
16.3	The bridegroom gives the gold to the father of the bride with the words, "I give you this gold for the sake of progeny."
16.4	The father of the bride receives it with the words, “I accept you for the sake of wealth and nourishment.”
16.5	The gold which is the price of the girl is received and placed in a copper vessel filled with water, and they sprinkle it with the four verses beginning with "Hiranyavarnah." They sprinkle it for the purification of terrible sins. The plural number is in view of all the relatives, to show that all share in the sin. The verses beginning with "Hirannyavarnah" have been explained at the time of sweeping. Some use only these two mantras, "I give you for the sake of offspring, for the sake of wealth," and "I receive you for the sake offspring, for the purpose of wealth," up to the end of the sentence, like "Ise tvam," and so on. According to another opinion, the first one means "May you breathe after the offspring, and may the offspring breathe after you," and the second one means "I receive you, O Suparna, for the sake offspring and for the sake of valour."
17.1	Because the order of meaning is stronger than the order of text, the explanation should be done according to that, as it has been done in the case of "Jātam" and "Janinā juhoti", "Jātam atiprāṇiti". Similarly, "Agnihotreṇa juhoti", and "Yavāgūmadhiśrayati". Thus, the meaning is that the girl sits facing east on a beautiful seat with four legs, and there are four widows in the four directions - the mother on the left, the father on the right, the guru who performs the consecration in front, and the seventh one. With the cows belonging to the cow-donors, the guru covers the girl with a special cloth having a thousand holes, for the sake of good progeny, and adorns her with bracelets, earrings, etc. according to his ability, with the same mantras as the cow-donators, and covers her with a new, unused cloth. The guru performs the homa with the cooked rice. Here, the four leaves cover the cloth and the pavitra. The parents sprinkle water. The guru recites the mantras during the bath and adornment. The guru himself is the performer, and by that homa, there is the same performer. Those who explain the adornment as hair removal with the opposite characteristics, they are inauspicious. The cooked rice is mentioned as being taken. Therefore, oneness is intended, like the oneness belonging to the animal. The singular "juhoti" indicates that there is only one homa in the nine oblations, as indicated by the force of recognition. Therefore, he mentions the oblations as "Viśvāvasave Gandharvarāyaye". There is only one oblation, thus making nine. Indra is the Supreme Lord. Indrāṇī is Śacī. Kāma is the desirable one. Bhaga is the one to be worshipped. Hrīḥ is modesty. Śrīḥ is the one to seek refuge in. Lakṣmīḥ is the one for whom Lakṣaṇa is the sign. Posa is nourishment. Svāhā is the excellent offering.
17.2	All the instruments like the flute etc. are smeared with fragrant water and played first. While they are being played, the Guru recites the mantra. Therein, the flute, the bamboo, the Go-mukha (a kind of musical instrument) are the instruments. The meaning of the mantra is this: O Dundubhi, O Patha, make a sound, make a sound. Make a sound, make it sound. For what purpose? For the sake of good progeny, for the sake of good offspring. Similarly, O Go-mukha, make a noise. The girls play with each other, along with the girl whose marriage has been performed. Those girls too should be allowed to play, because friendship between those of similar nature is mutual. How are the girls? They are delighted, pleased, it means. May Indra also descend to play in this festival. May they be auspicious, singing with auspicious sounds. Now the mantras of the cow-giving ritual are explained. Those divine waters that have become milk, those that are in the sky and those that are on earth, I anoint you with the radiance of all those waters. With the radiance of the sacrifice, I anoint thee with milk. May Savita make thee as Mitravardhana, as one who increases the sacrifice. O daughter, I anoint thou. I anoint thee. With the sacrifice, with milk, with radiance, I make thee fit for the sacrifice. As Mitravardhana, the enhancer of Mitra, the heaven-dwelling animal, the son, and the sacrifice, may Savita, the Sun, make thee so. O daughter, may it be well-offered to Indra.
18.1-2	The one who is worthy of sacrifice, the one who is fit for sacrifice, is the one who cuts the branch of a tree that is fit for sacrifice. The cutting is done with a single stroke of the thread, which is stretched in the eastern direction and cut with a single stroke. The thread is then covered with a single-stranded thread. The teacher gives the girl the branch, saying "To the god you..." and ending with the words "I give her." The teacher recites the following verses to the girl who has taken the branch: "O daughter, whatever misfortune or bad omen may have come to you from your mother or father, or from the seed, or from anywhere else, I remove it from you with this mantra. Is it enough to do it alone? No, it is done together with the deity Tisya. I also remove it completely. And that which is removed goes to your enemy, the one who hates you. And to the one who is trying to remove the bad omen, I offer salutations to Tisya and Brihaspati. Others, however, cut off a part of the Yajur Veda and use it even when releasing the branch: "Salutations to Tisya, salutations to Brihaspati."
18.3	The place where the water is stagnant is called sthāvarodaka. The act of offering it to the deity is called pratipatti. The temple is pure. But it may be impure due to the offerings of wine, blood etc. Hence the word 'pure' is used.
19.1	The term 'havisyaka' is a technical term for a particular rite.
19.2	After ten years, the girl should not be kept by the father, or if there is no choice, the twelve years should not be exceeded.
19.3	At the end of the life of a student, before marriage, in a place where water flows from a spring, or in a temple, one should light two fires for the sake of consecrating the girl, and offer two goats as animals, according to the rules for animal sacrifice. One goat should be offered to Aryaman in the southern part of the fire, and the other to Prajapati in the northern part. We will explain the procedure and the mantras in the section on animal sacrifice.
19.4	When there is plenty of wealth, the animal should be offered to two deities. The offerings should be taken twice from the twelve parts beginning with the heart and ending with fat. The offering should be made with the formula, "Svāhā to Aryaman and Prajapati." There should be only one union, because the parts of the two are related by the property of being a part. For this reason, some do not desire the offerings to be doubled from the heart and so on.
19.5	When there is a scarcity of wealth or when there is a restriction on non-violence, one should perform the rite with rice. The mention of rice is for the purpose of making flour.
19.6	The Pishtasah animal is to be offered at the same place where the principal animal is offered. The oblations are to be offered to the heart and other organs. The offering of the cooked organs and the oblation of fat are to be offered as before. The binding of the rope, the placing of the sacrificial post, the cutting and other rites are to be performed as before. The oblation is to be offered without the discarded portion. The Sthalipaka oblation is to take the place of the Pasupurodasa oblation. The offering of fat is to be offered in place of the offering of the fat of the animal.
19.7	The oblations of fragrant ghee mixed with the essence of fragrant sandalwood and other substances are called gandha-ahuti. With these, one should offer oblations to the seventeen deities beginning with Agni, as mentioned in the Vatsa-putra-sutra. The deities are known from the singular form of the word. They should be worshipped by mentioning them with the fourth case ending and the word "svāhā" in the form "Agnaye svāhā" and so on.
20.1	This is also a technical term. The word is used in the sense of the act of performing the sacrifice with the sacrificial material like barley etc. on an auspicious day.
20.2	Having gone near water, in a village where there is a pond at a great distance, she should be bathed in milk cooked in a pot, in the place where she is born, with fruits of mango, bilva, and wood apple, and with all medicinal herbs and other fragrant substances, and with amalaka. She should be bathed with her head, indicating that women are bathed without their heads on other occasions. The Homa is done with the cloth that is struck by the bath, and the Staalipaka is desired before the bath. The fourth case is the transformation of the word for the deity, and the word svaha is as before. The deity is Agni, the son of life, which is one. Life is the wind, the son is the protector of this, it is a Bahuvrihi compound, the other word is Agni, which is the principal and is present. In "Maharaja", there is no prohibition like "not by worship" (5.4.69), because it is based on rules, and because of the statement "In worship, the word svaha should be used". Otherwise, there would be prohibition of the word svaha in "Paramaraja" and other places. Those who read the text ending with "ye ye tu maharaja" do not care for the rule of svaha.
21.1	The first night is the night of marriage. The second night is the night when the father is going to marry his daughter. The father is going to give his daughter in marriage. The father is engaged in giving his daughter in marriage, or the father is going with the intention of giving his daughter in the future. The first night is when the father is giving his daughter in this way. The father is giving his own daughter in marriage. The father is giving his only daughter in marriage. He is giving his daughter to someone else. The father is doing this. The father is performing this. The father has performed this. The father will perform this. The father performs this. The father gives his daughter in marriage.
21.2	For the man also, for the purpose of sanctification, it is prescribed that he should offer these very oblations to these very deities, and the three oblations beginning with the pot. This is the only difference: the woman offers twelve oblations, the man fifteen.
22.1	Those who are not widows, and are living with their husbands, should feed Brahmins with Shaka-mixed food, and then sing auspicious songs with those who sing along with the playing of the veena. The occasion for singing auspicious songs after feeding Brahmins is intended here, not excessive respect for the same performer. Therefore, they should feed Brahmins or others, and in any case, auspicious songs should be sung after feeding Brahmins. Or, one who is skilled in dancing should dance with four. If one possesses qualities such as gentleness, etc., then one should not dance with them. The word "or" is used with this intention. The practice, however, is as seen in the Arya-varta, and we shall explain it thus: The eight or four women, starting from the mother of the bride, should feed Brahmanas according to their means, and then sing and dance with enthusiasm along with those who sing with the playing of veena. Who are meant? The bride and others. The word "also" indicates inclusion. The entire group of women should dance with enthusiasm. One should bless them with the Gayatri verse "May you play." This has been explained in the context of austerities.
22.2	One should offer oblations to Agni, the lord of prosperity, with barley-flour, using the verse "Agni, the lord of wealth," and to Prajapati, using the verse beginning with "Prajapati." These two offerings are at the end of the oblations of clarified butter.
22.3	Where the deity is indicated by name or by the letters of the mantra, in the rites mentioned in the section on marriage, one should worship Agni, Pustipati, and Prajapati with unbroken grains and ghee at the end of the oblations. This should be understood in the rites mentioned earlier, where in some cases the deity is indicated only by name and in some cases by the letters of mantras. In all cases, the deity is well-known. By worshipping Agni, one should obtain wealth. 'Asha' means to pervade. One should obtain the nourishment and growth of what is pervaded and obtained, day by day. What kind of wealth? Wealth that is glorious, that brings fame, that is endowed with the best heroes, or that is endowed with sons who are superior to heroes. 'O Prajapati, not so' will be explained in the rite of birth.
23.1	The ceremony of departure is the ceremony of departure, which will be described later. The departure is for the bridegroom to reach the house of his father-in-law to perform the marriage.
23.2	In the rite of Prāsthāna, having performed the prescribed rites, the consecration of Agni is done by means of eleven continuous oblations preceded by the sprinkling, pouring and spreading of the Agni that has been raised and sprinkled. Here one should perform the Homa with the mantras beginning with Jaya. The Homa should be performed with the mantras mentioning Jaya. The meaning is that one should offer oblations with the mantras 'Ākūtam ca ākūtiś ca' and 'Bṛhaspatinā purohitaiḥ' and 'Rtāṣāṭ'. These mantras or the Homa performed with them are well-known as being accomplished by the words Jaya, Ātāraṣṭra, Bhṛd, and Ajyabhāga. And at the end of the Ajyabhāgas, one should worship Agni, Pūṣan Pati, and Prajāpati. Some say that this is according to the authority of the sutra that says, 'In all marriage rites, where the deities are not specified'. Others say that the word Jaya is defined here as the deities Agni and Prajāpati in the Homa, according to the authority given by the sutra-writer. Some say that the consecration ends with the Ajyabhūgas. Having performed the rites ending with the Ajybhāgas for the sake of prosperity, one should offer oblation to Agni, Pūsan Pati, with unbroken grains. This is done to establish the authority of the sūtra-writer. Otherwise, since the deities are known everywhere by name or by the words of the mantras, there is no marriage rite in which the deities are not mentioned. Thus there would be no establishment of the authority of the Sutra. Having performed the Homa with Jaya, at the end of Ajyabhāg, the sister, whether principal or subordinate, standing behind the bridegroom, silently takes the handle of the upper garment of her brother, silently taking hold of the handle of the sword, razor, or other weapon held in his hand. The taking of the handle is for the unseen sanctification, and the taking of the weapon is also for that purpose. Mostly that same weapon is seen later on, placed near the bed for protection.
23.3	"May Pūṣan protect me on the path." This means that they go facing the water with this mantra.
23.4	Having reached the water's edge, having performed the sprinkling of water and the sipping of water, having said the mantra beginning with 'The eastern direction is Agni as the deity', and having said the mantra indicating the direction in which they are to go, the bridegroom and others proceed. Here, the preceptor who performs the marriage, or the father of the bridegroom, recites the mantras. 'Pūṣan protect me on the path, Pūṣan, the protector of cattle, protect me, Pūṣa, the lord, protect me. Pūṣan nourishes and increases.' Pūṣan is the earth, the atmosphere, and the sky. The Brāhmaṇa says, 'This is Pūṣan on the path, the atmosphere is the protector of cattle; the sky is the lord.' This shows that the word 'Pūṣa' in the mantra refers to the earth, which is indicated by the term 'this'. The mantra 'The atmosphere is Pūṣa' also shows that the word Pūṣa refers to the atmosphere. Just as the earth nourishes, so does the atmosphere protect the cattle by providing space. The sky is also Pūṣa because it is the lord of all worlds, for it nourishes all worlds through rain and other means. The meaning of this mantra is that Pūṣa on the path, which is being traversed, should protect me; Pūṣa who is the protector of the cattle, should protect me, and Pūṣa the lord should protect me on the way. 'May the goddesses protect us.' These have been explained. 'The eastern direction has Agni as the deity. May he reach Agni, the one who is attacking me from that direction.' 'The southern direction has Indra as the deity. The western direction has Soma as the deity. 'The northern direction has Mitra-Varuna as the deity. They should reach Mitra-Varuna, the one who attacks me from that direction. 'The upward direction has Brihaspati as the deity. He should reach Brihaspati, the one who assaults me from that direction.'' 'This direction has Aditi as the deity. She should reach Aditi, the one who assails me from that direction'. The eastern direction has Agni, the deity. Therefore, the one who asssaults me from that direction should reach Agni. He should experience the dissolution of the senses with Agni as the focus. Agni should restrain the eyes and other senses of the one who is ascending the mountain. This is the same in all cases. Some say that the mantra should be recited only in the direction towards which one is going. This is appropriate because the mantra is meant to avert harm. When one proceeds towards any direction, disturbance is possible from all directions, from serpents, lightning, and others below and above, and also from the sides.
24.1	The bridegroom should be honoured by the father-in-law with water for washing the feet, water for sipping, and water for offering, before the marriage. The honouring of the six is to be done equally. The six are mentioned here. They are worthy of being honoured. The six are: the preceptor, the teacher, the instructor, the student, the king, and the one who is dear. The preceptor and the teacher are worthy of being worshipped by the student before the performance of the rites. The king, even if he is a kshatriya, is worthy of being worshipped in the kingdom, not in the form of consecration. The bridegroom is worthy of being married. The suffix 'nyat' is added to 'arhe' according to the rule 'arhe krtatricah'. The father of the bride is worthy of being honoured with water for offering. One who is dear to someone due to his excellence in qualities is worthy of being honored with gifts on the occasion of giving. The one who has just bathed is worthy of being respected by the preceptor.
24.2	The word "atha" means acceptance of the method to be described, because the word "atha" has many meanings. They honor, respect, and esteem this teacher or any of the others mentioned, in the manner to be described.
24.3	Some say that the offering should be made after marriage, as it is prescribed in the order of sequence as mentioned. Thus, the offering of Madhuparka etc. should be made after the marriage. They also explain this as being done after the marriage. To refute this, it is said that the offering should first be made before the ceremony, because the order of sequence in the text is more important than the order of sequence of meaning. This rite is meant to create a special competence of the officiating priests etc. in the ceremony by generating enthusiasm etc. If it is done after the ceremony of marriage etc. is completed, it would be fruitless. This rite is also prescribed in the Smritis before the ceremony. And the one who deserves to be married is one who deserves to marry, or one who must marry, or one whose marriage is necessary. The one who deserves to get married is one who must marry the girl. It is said in the Smriti: “One who deserves to be done, one who is to be done, and one who is to do; one who is to get married, one who is necessary, one who is inferior, and one who must be done.” And one does not deserve to be married after the marriage.
24.4	Water, either rice or barley, and darbha grass—these three are the argha. The author states the method of worship, which is preceded by the characteristics of Madhuparka, and which is not taught by the preceptor.
24.5	Here, the worshipers are understood by the meaning of the text. In a bell-metal vessel, a copper vessel, or a special wooden vessel, curd is sprinkled and honey is added. The vessel containing honey is called Madhuparka. That Madhuparka vessel is covered with a large vessel, wrapped with two sheets, and taken by the worshipers. They themselves perform the worship of the first offerings of water for washing the feet, Arghya, and Madhuparka, as appropriate, at the top, bottom, and middle, without expecting instructions there.
24.6	When the giver of the girl is near the bridegroom, the priest brings the water for washing the feet etc. to the giver of the bride. The bridegroom recites this mantra when the water is brought. If the bridegroom is not learned in the mantra, then the priest himself makes him recite it. This should be known in all cases. The meaning of this mantra is as follows: 'Duh' means filling, the filler, the nourisher. Viraj is Prajapati in heaven and other places. Water for washing the feet, etc. is mentioned. The meaning is: 'O water for washing the fee, etc., you who are the filler for me, for my sake, are the filler of Viraj, Prajapati. You are the filler of the water, etc., appointed by Prajapati for heaven. Therefore, you be for the purpose of my receiving the water for washing my feet. I shall obtain the water for washing feet, which is related to Viraj, Prajapatī. I shall see it.' The water for washing the feat is seen for the purpose of sanctifying it.
24.7	Having spread a mat of Darbha grass on the seat, the bridegroom sits down silently, with the mantra, "O mat, you are the mat, you become the mat. Therefore, you cover the seat. O mother, sit down on the seat."
24.8	The giver of the girl says each of the articles like water for washing the feet, etc. thrice to the bridegroom who is seated on a seat covered with Darbha grass and spread on the ground. "The word "āsināy" is in the fourth case, meaning "seated on the ground", and "viṣṭare" means "seated on the seat".
24.9	The word "bho" is used to address a person who is worthy of respect, and the word "marṣa" is used to refer to a person by name, such as "Brahmadatta". The author refutes this.
24.10	With the mantras beginning with "May the goddesses protect us" explained earlier, he sprinkles water on the feet of the bride, who is worthy of being honored, with water that is capable of washing the feet. The giver of the bride washes the feet of the one who is worthy of receiving the bride, with the mantras "The right foot" and "The left foot". This shows the immediate result of giving the bride, which is accomplished by the marriage ceremony, and which is related to the performance of the rite immediately. "I purify the left foot of the one who deserves to be married, which is endowed with brahminical splendor." "I give the one who deserves the bride, the splendor, energy, food, offspring, cattle, and brahminical splendor. May the splendor, etc., that has come to me in the one who deserves honor, remain in me for a long time."
24.11	The water is the highest, etc. With the mantra "I accept the Madhuparka with the permission of Savitar, the god of the sun, with the arms of the Ashvins and the hands of Pusan," he accepts the Madhuparka. With the verse "You are the spread, may you rest on the sky," he removes the upper spread and throws it away. With the words "That is the eye," etc., having seen the Madhuparka, with the verse "You belong to the earth," he places the Madhuparka vessel on the lower spread. With the three verses "The wind blows the truth, the rivers flow honey," "May the plants be sweet for us," "May the cows be sweet for us." "May the winds and breezes be sweet, may they be full of sweet juice." For whom does the truth blow? For him who desires truth or sacrifice. The rivers flow honey for him. May the plants be full of honey for us. May the night be sweet for us, and may the day be sweet for us. "May the earth be sweet for us" means may it be full of honey. "May heaven be sweet for us". "May the cows be full of honey" means may they be full-of-honey through giving milk, etc.
24.12	Having made the offerings beginning from the east and proceeding clockwise, the offerings should be consumed with the following mantras at the edges of the Madhuparka vessel. The offerings should be made in each direction according to the respective mantras. By the statement "in each direction according to each mantra," it is implied that the offerings should be made to the east and other directions as mentioned earlier. The meaning of the mantra is as follows: "O offering, may the Vasus, the deities residing in the eastern direction, consume you. May the Vasus be satisfied by you." What kind of Vasus? Those whose king is Agni. In the case of a compound ending in a masculine noun, the above is the rule. This is the same in all the mantras.
24.13	He eats four times with the thumb and each finger, taking the portions of the Madhuparka with the thumb and the little finger, then with the ring finger, the middle finger, and the index finger, each with the thumb. When the four portions are taken with the thumb, he gives what remains to his younger brother and others, saying, "This is the essence of the Madhu, the essence of nectar, the essence of the essence." The meaning of the mantra is that the elements such as earth are like nectar or amṛta, Madhvya means the essence of honey, the essence of amṛta, the essence of essence. "This earth is the essence of all beings" (Brh. 2.5.1), etc., in the Brhadāraṇyaka, it is stated that the earth is the essence among the elements. That Madhvya, which has the characteristic of earth, the essence of essences, by eating that supreme, most excellent form, which is in the form of food, etc., I become the supreme food, the supreme Self, the supreme Self in the form of eternal bliss, the supreme Self which is to be eaten, the supreme food, which is to be enjoyed with perfect awareness. By dissolving into that, may I attain the state of Brahman. "O Madhuparka, you are the glory of the three Vedas, the light of the three Vedas. You are the glory and wealth of prosperity. Therefore, I eat you for glory." "You are the radiance of Brahman, the supreme Self. You are the wealth of truth, the meaning of the Vedas, and the wealth of glory. Therefore, may prosperity be in me, may prosperity be again and again in me."
24.14	With this mantra he sips water. "O water for sipping, you are the spreading and covering of the nectar-like Madhuparka.
24.15	Having been honoured and offered the Madhuparka, taking up a sword in his hand, he says to the one who deserves honour and has eaten the Madhuparka: 'I will give the cow.' He requests permission with the intention of doing something else. The giving of the cow means its killing.
24.16	The cow is instructed thus: "Oṃ, do this." This means that the one deserving honor gives permission. The mantra for the one deserving honor is said: "O cow, for me and for Agniśarman and for Viṣṇuśarman, the worshipable one, for whose sake I am compelled by the Vedic ritual to do this undesired act, destroy his sin, that is, annihilate it. Or, my sin is destroyed, because this act is commanded by the ritual." "O destroyers, destroy my sin." "O cow, be done." This means that permission is granted.
24.17-18	At first, he should feed four Brahmins of different families and different castes, and then the deserving one along with his relatives. This is the first method for a Brahmin. The method of giving a cow etc. has been prescribed. It should not be doubted.
24.19	If the word 'if' is used even when something is certain, as in 'if the Vedas are authoritative', then one should let go the cow after stating the prescribed procedure, meaning 'do not kill'. One should recite 'This cow is the mother of the Rudras, the gods who move in the sky, the nourisher of the Vasus, the nourishers, the daughter of the herbs born from the earth, the sister of the Adityas, the daughter of Aditi. Therefore, I am speaking to the healer for the sake of the people. The word 'to' indicates certainty. Having determined, I am speaking for the sake of people who have superior consciousness. What do I say? O slayers! Do not kill this cow. What kind of cow? The one who is free from future sins, the one who is not injured by Aditi, or the one who is free of weakness. From where? Because she eats good grass. O cow! You are the one who has wealth, milk, and fame. May you be the one who has milk. May we also, through your grace, become wealthy, have wealth, and be famous. O one who is not harmed! Eat the grass. Because you are the giver of everything to everyone, drink the pure water through the means of milk. May you wander and roam everywhere.
24.20-21	The sacrificer, having said "Oṃ, I have decided without hesitation", says to the performers, "You all release the animal. Having been released, let it graze on grass as it pleases." Having seen the animal, a goat or a sheep, released, one should offer a piece of meat as a substitute. It is known from the Veda that the Madhuparka should be without meat. The word "ha" is used in history. Or, rice mixed with ghee should be offered to those who hate meat.
25.1	With the mantra "Anṛkṣarāḥ" and so on, he sends the person who has taken the water vessel to bring water. The meaning is that he sends a man to bring water for the use of the girls in bathing and other purposes. The meaning of the verse is that the path of the sun, which is the sage of Brahma, is singular in the locative case. "Anṛk-ṣarāḥ," the thorns and other rough grasses, are not found in them, hence "anṛkṣarās." Let there be paths that are straight and not crooked. Those by which our friends, the ones related to us, go to the place of water to be brought, such as the Ganges, in the plural by the rule of "sakhā" and so on. "Aryama," the sun, and "Bhaga" may bring our friend to the place where the water is to be brought. "O gods, the officiating priests and others, and the sun and others, may your grace bring the union of the husband and wife together, may it be well-controlled, stable, and complete." The word "jāspatyau" is used in the Chhandas in the sense of "jāyāyāḥ patyau".
25.2	Having been sent out, he should cover the water pot with a twig of the śamī tree with leaves, and bring the water.
25.3	Having taken away the parts of the water that are connected with these brought waters, and having prepared the water, he should perform the rites of burning the gold, sprinkling with fire, etc., with the water that is left, and not with any other water.
25.4	The girl should be bathed with water mixed with all kinds of herbs and fruits, reciting the mantra "May the waters be auspicious..." Then, with the mantra "Those who did not cut..." she should be made to wear a new, fresh, and unseen garment. Then, with the following mantra, she should be covered so that she is not visible. The girl should be dressed with a yoke made of Muñja grass or Darbha grass. The Anustubh verse "May the waters..." is explained. Those who were brought by the statement "Those who did..." are auspicious for us. The special meaning is "May they be auspicious." "Those who did" is in the Jagati meter. O youthful girl, wear this garment. May all those goddesses cover you with old age. May the goddesses make you old and decrepit, with your husband. May they make your life long. Who are those goddesses? Those who did not cut this garment, those who made it with cutting, those who are the presiding deities, those who made the garment, those who stretched it, those who stretched the thread lengthwise, and those who stretched it around the ends, the ends of the root and the leaves. Those goddesses are mentioned by their own names in another mantra: "May Revati protect you..." Desiring happiness, offspring, good fortune, and wealth, becoming a follower of Agni, she should be dressed. What is the purpose of binding the garment? For the purpose of the rites of marriage, prior rituals, and fire offerings. "Kama" means "for the sake of desire." Just as in "For the sake of the eyes, what is given first?" there is the understanding of "for the sake," similarly here also there is the understanding "for the sake" of good deeds. What kind of woman? One who desires happiness, a contented mind, good fortune, being agreeable to her husband, and wealth, and becoming a follower of the fire, one who is engaged in serving the sacrificial fire, should be dressed.
25.5-6	"The father or the elder brother, having taken her from the place of the dead, and placing her on his lap, should perform the rite with the mantra beginning with 'Ya akrntan', meaning that he should perform the rite by covering her with the upper part of his garment, as one would cover the lower part of the garment. The first and third verses are in Anushtup, the second in Tristup. O young lady, be released from this place. I release you. I lead you to your husband. Be released.' Here there is a change in the verbal form and the person. Thus, in another branch, the mantra is recited as 'I release the dead.' In the family of the father and in the family of the husband, may this chaste girl be well-bound and well-united. May no one separate her from the family of the mother and the family of the groom. May no one cause separation in both families. O Indra, the supreme lord, the bestower, may this girl be well-born and well-blessed. O young lady! May Pūṣan and Indra lead you from this place, holding your hand. May the Ashvins also convey you by chariot to the desired place. Thus, in due order, may you go to your husband's house. There, may the mistress of the house be the protector of the house, and may she be the lord. May she be obedient and have control over the servants. May she not speak against her husband in the sacrifice. May she be favorable to the Vedic rites.' Those who are obstacles on the path, unfavorable like thieves, may they not find you. May they not see you. May you go well. May you have crossed the bad path. May all obstacles, enemies, and those without wealth, be frightened and turn away. May they flee, obtaining the despicable state of stumbling.'
25.7	At this time, the rites that are well-known due to the customs of the country, caste, and family should be performed. For example, stating the purpose of coming, taking the name of the girl, worshipping the family deity, striking with the creeper of good flowers, and so on.
25.8	This is the fire of the Upavasatha rite. The Paakayajna rites are performed in it. The four kinds of fires are mentioned here as optional. The fire produced by rubbing two sticks together is called Nirmanthya. The fire produced from the stone heated by the fire of the fire produced by rubbing the two sticks together is the second. The fire produced after mixing the cotton and cowdung powder with the stone heated by fire is the third. The fire produced when the Sun-stone is placed in the sun is the fourth. Here, even though the text mentions without any distinction, it should be understood that the fire produced by the rubbing of two sticks is excluded from the fires of the cremation ground and the house. The fire should be placed in a pit dug at the height of the knee, outside the house. Sprinkling means touching with water in all directions. Pouring means sprinkling. Thus sprinkling with Darbha grass is well-known. Others think that the sprinkling is done in the east, south and west. Since the verse says "with three layers", it is seen in the Vaishravana view. Having offered the oblations beginning with the Ajya-bhag, the bridegroom and the bride, standing in the western part of the fire, are yoked to the sacrificial post in the order of their names, the bridegroom in the right part and the bride in the left part. The meaning is that they are yoked with the yoke. In the verse "In every union, in every strength, we invoke Indra, the friend, for the sake of protection", the word "union" means the state of being together. In the verse "In the food, in every food, we invoke Indra", the word "food" means food. Here, the word "food", which means food, is taken. The word "food" will be used to mean the means of food, as in the verse "In all the oblations, in all the oblations". The word "food" is used to mean food because of the root of the word "food". The word "tavas" means strength or greatness. The meaning is "greater strength" or "greater greatness".
25.9	The mantra prescribed is here also prohibited by the words “he remains silent”. Having released the yoke fastened with the rope, and having placed the gold in the hole of the yoke on the right side, he sprinkles it with water from the Darbha grass. How is it bound? Having performed the Nistarka rite, so that it may be easily released, that is the meaning. The Nistarka rite is for easy release. Having bound that gold, he then brings the girl to the auspicious place on the right side and sprinkles the gold and the hole of the right side of the yoke with the water mentioned earlier. At this juncture, there is a change in the positions of the girl and the bridegroom. They will remain in their respective positions. It will be said later, “The man is on the right side”. “Khe rathasya” is in the Anushtup metre. It is the Brahmanical verse. When it is said elsewhere, it is the Brahmanical one. The memory of the general observation that the Vedas emerged from him after the curved ones, “Then the Vedas emerged from the curved ones”, is based on the statement, “After the curved ones”. O Indra, the one with unlimited deeds, the supreme lord among the lustrous ones, may the Sun make this girl have the lustre of the Sun and the beauty of the Sun. Having purified her three times, how? Having made her pure three times. What kind of girl? One who is pure, fit for purification, and free to move about before marriage. Where? In the hole of the chariot, and in the hole of a cart and a yoke. Or, “Indra may make this girl pure like Apala”. This is an explanatory statement. As if Indra made Apala, the daughter of Atri afflicted with leprosy, pure by sprinkling her with gold water in the holes of the sacrificial post and other objects seen by her while bathing in an empty hermitage, and made her have the lustre of Surya, similarly may Indra make this girl free from sins and have the lustre of Sun. Thus it is said in the Puranas, “Apala, the daughter born to Atri, was afflicted with skin disease. Indra desired her after seeing her in the empty hermitage of her father. Indra sprinkled her in the holes of a chariot, a cart, and a yoke. Then she became happy.” “May your gold be auspicious”. This is in the Jagati metre. O girl, may your gold be auspicious. May the waters be auspicious for you. The word “u” is used in the sense of conjunction. May the waters also be auspicious for you, O girl. May the waters, which are auspicious and cause happiness, be auspicious for you.
25.10	When the consecration ceremony of the girl is performed, then the man becomes facing east in the other part of the fire, i.e., the girl becomes on the north. Here, some say that the girl is the principal because she is brought to the southern part and consecrated, while others say that the man is the principal because he is independent and always remains in the southern part.
25.11	The word "atha" means auspicious, says Matha. The word "atha", indicates the offering of unbroken grains and barley in between, says Adityadarsana. Indeed, it is necessary to offer these oblations in between the oblations mentioned above, as per the stated reason. Therefore, he mentions the oblations in order, saying "to Agni" and so on. It is heard that "in the beginning, women were enjoyed by the gods, Soma, Gandharva, and Fire". Therefore, the oblation is for their purchase. Although Soma is the first, still the oblation is offered before him here to Agni, with the intention that "by which rite one should cut off the mouth of Agni". To whom? To the one who knows the bride, the one who knows or obtains the bride. The same applies to the others.
25.12	The eleven Sāntanīs begin with this.
25.13	The meaning is that one offers the Jāyas and Ābhyatānas, and also the Rāṣṭrabhṛts.
25.14	Those three rites beginning with Jayā are to be performed in the order stated. Laugākṣi says that one should offer the Jayā oblation with twelve spoonfuls of ghee, reciting the mantra as learned. Some say that there should be twelve offerings with the Svāhā at the end of the Rk. Others perform it by reciting all the mantras with twelve spoonfuls taken from the ghee, and offering it once with Svāhā at its end. But they take up twelve spoonfuls for each mantra. In the Abhimantrita Homa, one offers with four spoonfuls. There, 'Bṛhaspatipurorhitāḥ' and 'Devahūtyām' are taken as striking. In the Rāṣṭrabhṛt, one offers thirteen times with twelve spoonfuls. Having offered twelve times with the Rtasāḍa, one offers once with 'Sa no bhuvanasya pate' and 'Rathaमुखेऽध्यध्याग्निं प्रियाणस्य' as stated. This triad is well-established in the Pākayajñas, and we shall explain it there along with the mantras.
25.15	The words 'lord' and 'lord' indicate the lords. They are twenty-one in number. Agni is the lord of beings. May he protect me. To him, salutations. Yama is the lord of the earth. Vayu is the lord of space. Surya is the lord of heaven. The moon is the lord of stars. Vishnu is the lord of directions. Pusan is the lord of paths. Tvashtra is the lord of forms. Savita is the lord of births. Indra is the lord of superiors. Mitra is the lord of truths. Varuna is the lord of duties. Rudra is the lord of cattle. Brihaspati is the lord of Brahmins. The Brahmin is the lord of speech. Soma is the lord of plants. The ocean is the lord of flowing rivers. Food is the lord of kingdoms. May it protect me. To it, salutations. Gayatri is the lord of metres. May she protect me. To her, salutations. Maruts are the lords of groups. May they protect me. To them, salutations. Fathers and grandfathers are the lords of the distant. May they protect us. May they protect the near. May they protect in this Brahminical act, in this field, in this blessing being received by the priests, which is the fruit of the couple. Although the priests recite 'may they protect me', still it is the sacrificer's fruit, since the act is bought by the Dakshina. In the Purohita act, in the Devahutis, where the gods are called for the offering of oblations, that Devahutis, the marriage ground, is here.
25.16-20	'For Akriti thee' and other mantras, having offered the oblations, one should offer the oblations of the oblations on the head of the bride. The offering of the oblations is for the purpose of removing the faults of the mantras. Some say that the offering of the oblation is for the purpose indicated by the mantras. Others say that the offering is for the purpose mentioned in the mantras. The entire Anushaka is to be known as one offering. The Agnipavamana mantras are those containing the word Agni. The Akriti is the intention, the desire. For the sake of fulfilling the desired object, the oblation is offered. The Agnipava mantras are those beginning with 'Agni'. The Agnipavamantras are those beginning 'Agni'. 'Agni' is the sage, the purifier, the priest of the five classes. We request that great Agni. 'O Agni, purify us, O Agni, purify us. What do you do? You purify us, O purifier, with the beautiful waters. You give us the beautiful splendor and strength, and also the wealth and nourishment.' Having offered the oblations with these three mantras, one should offer them on the head of a bride. The meaning of the three mantras is this: 'O bride, I make your wife-killing body wife-killing. By this offering of the obulations, I make your body, which is not for your sons, for your sons. I make your body which is not for cattle, for cattle.' At this time, one should offer unbroken barley grains according to the previously indicated procedure. The taking of the hand is stated.
25.21	The Guru should make the girl hold the hand connected with her, by means of the mantra "Devāsyāntarātmanaḥ Savitā" etc., which should be understood as being applicable to the same agent. When there is a doubt as to who is using it, it should be understood as the assistant. And the assistant, being authorized by the Guru, takes it. What kind of bridegroom takes it? One who is pure, authorized to take the hand, with a pure resolve that "This is for the purpose of Dharma", facing the opposite direction, standing in front of the girl, with the intention of making an exception to the rule "One should perform all rites facing the east", hence "facing the opposite direction". The right hand is well-known in the world, with the thumb, stretched out, lowered, moving very slightly to the right, and proficient in gestures. The right hand is called "nyak" because it moves slightly to the right. As it is said in the Dhanurveda, "One should first learn with the left, for the right is already accomplished." It is empty, with ornaments, or in the absence of that, with a golden lotus and other things, and in extreme poverty, with flowers and fruits. With the left, the left. This is a general statement about the entire mantra. "O daughter, I am taking your hand. You are the daughter of the inner self of the god Savita. You are engaged in the permission of the birth of the Vedic rites. You are engaged at the time of the permission of the shining of the sun Savita. You bow with your own arms made of leather to the arms of the Ashvins, and I take them with the arms of Pusan."
25.22	I take your hands for the sake of good offspring, that you may be with me as long as life, like Bhaga, Aryaman, Savitar, and the ancient Goddess. The four gods Bhaga, etc., have given you to me for the sake of the household fire. O Pusan, lead her to the most auspicious thought, in whom men sow seed, in whom the thighs of the longing one rest, in whom the longing one casts the seed. O Pusan Aditya, lead her to that most auspicious thought, by which she is the basis of the seed, in whom men cast seed, in whom, being desirous, the thighs of the one who longs rest, in whom, having cast the seed, the longing one casts it. Thus there is mutual affection between us. For thus it is said: “Where there is affection between husband and wife, there the three classes prosper.” Soma gave to Gandharva, Gandharva gave to Agni, Agni gave to me, and this maiden. This maiden was formerly connected with Soma. Soma, having enjoyed her, gave her to Gandharva. Gandharva gave her to Agni. Agni gave her to me. Agni, having given this maiden to me, may he make me prosperous with sons and wealth. This same meaning is explained in the fourth verse. Soma first knew you, Gandharva knew you next, Agni was your third husband, and I, a human, am your fourth. O maiden, Soma first knew you and became your first husband. Then Gandharva knew, and became your second. Agni was your third and became your husband. And I, a human being, am now your fourth.
25.25	The word “karma” means “practice”. The injunctions of the rites are completed by the performance of the rites once. In the case of the rites which are performed only once, the performance of the rite is followed by the performance of other rites. The rites are performed in a particular order. After performing the rites, one returns to the fire and performs the rites of marriage. The rites of marriage are performed in a specific order. The rites of the marriage are performed in the proper order. The rites are then performed in the proper sequence. The rites are repeated in the proper sequence.
25.26	The Homa offerings at the marriage ceremony, beginning with Jaya, and those beginning with "O Heaven and Earth", as well as the Svishtakrit, and the two Ajya-bhagas, all these are to be performed in the same order, as is indicated by the fact that they are not mentioned in the same context. Thus the two meanings of the Vedic texts, in the form of injunction and prohibition, have been indicated here as far as possible. The term "Svishtakrit" is used here to indicate the upper section of the text, and the term "Ajya-bhagas" is used to indicate the lower section.
25.27	There, in the one rite, having gone around the fire, having brought (the bride) back, having placed the feet of the bride and bridegroom on the darbha grass behind the fire, the preceptor makes the bridegroom recite, "You are that." The meaning is that the Rg was that, the Sama was that, and that is both the Sama and the Rg. Thus is the derivation of the word Sama. Having divided it into "both the Rg and the Sama," the bridegroom displays, "O bride, you are that Rg, you are that. I am that, I am that Sama. You are that, you are that; I am that, that." By repeating twice, he strengthens the nature of being both the Rg and Sama. "Come, let us marry." Both of us, O bride, come, let us marry, let us perform the marriage. For what purpose? "For a son, for a man, for making, for making." The affix "ten" is in the sense of the gerund, and the genitive case is used in "for a son, for making." "For a son" means "for making a son." Similarly, "for the sake of wealth, for nourishment, for growth, for the attainment of good offspring, for the sake of good offspring, and for the sake of the good and heroic, for the sake."
25.28	Having brought the bride and the bridegroom towards the fire, having placed a stone to the north of the fire, the preceptor, the performer, makes the bride and the groom stand on it with their right feet. The groom steps on the stone according to the mantra, the bride with the northern foot. The preceptor says, "May the two be blessed." The mantra is recited. "O groom, stand on the stone, be firm like a stone. May the Viśvedevas make your life a hundred autumns." "O bride, stand on this stone, be firm as a stone." "May the Dūrvāsīs destroy the enemies who desire to torment, may they perish." "May the Pṛtanās, those who desire to fight, be subdued, may they be conquered. May they be overcome by the southern foot." The northern mantra is also added here.
25.29	The brother of the bride or a student in the absence of the brother scatters the rice mixed with Samī leaves on the ladle with the verse, "This oblation may be for me, may it be tenfold, may it be endowed with all groups, for welfare. May it be for the self, for progeny, for cattle, for freedom from fear, for the world. May Agni make my progeny abundant, may he bestow food, milk, and semen upon us. The verse is in the Anushtup meter, the oblation called rice is for me, may be for progeny, may be tenfold, endowed with all groups of animals beginning with sons, for welfare, for non-destruction. May it be related to the self, related to progeny, related to cattle, related to freedom from fear, related to the world. Here in every case, the oblation is the other thing. May Agni make our progeny abundant, beginning with sons and grandsons, and may he bestow food etc. upon us. May he make it stable. By the use of the plural, Aryaman, Gandharva, and Tryambaka are worshipped and prayed to in the second half.
25.30	She offers the rice-grains without cutting them, in one offering, with the verse, "O Aryaman, the god, the maiden has worshipped Agni. May that god Aryaman, having come, release us from the house of so-and-so, svāhā." The deities are Brahman, Ārṣa, Gandharva, and Tryambaka. The verses for the upper Bṛhatī oblations are in the Anushtubh metre. "This maiden" is the Anushtubha verse. "The maiden has worshipped Agni, the god" means she has worshipped Agni. "Aryaman" is a qualification of Agni. "She protects from enemies" means Aryaman Agni. "She worships" is a change in the verbal form. Others worship Agni. Some explain the second as in the seventh case. "The maiden worships without Aryaman" means Aryaman alone is the deity. Having said this, the bride hopes for the fruit of the sacrifice. "Of so-and-such" generally indicates the name of the husband. "May that Aryaman, having been worshipped, release us from this house of so-such Devadatta, svāhā" means "May he not cause us to fall from this house of our husband." Svāhā means "May it be well melted."
25.31	The preceptor recites the mantra beginning with "Agni, may he make me the father of a son, may I be the wife of a living husband." "Jani" means wife, and "Agni" means the one who has a wife. May Agni make me have an unbroken connection with my wife through his grace. May I be the wife who is the wife of a husband.
25.32	This woman is speaking. This woman is speaking to me. The woman is speaking. The woman is saying. The woman is telling. The woman is reciting. The woman is praising. The woman is singing. The woman is chanting. The woman is instructing. The woman is teaching. The woman is explaining. The woman is proclaiming. The woman is declaring. The woman is announcing. The woman is revealing. The woman is disclosing. The woman is narrating. The woman is recounting. The woman is relating. The woman is describing. The woman is reporting. The woman is informing. The woman is communicating. The woman is conveying. The woman is transmitting. The woman is broadcasting. The woman is disseminating. The woman is distributing. The woman is dispensing. The woman is scattering. The woman is spreading. The woman is extending. The woman is enlarging. The woman is expanding. The woman is growing. The woman is increasing. The woman is multiplying. The woman is flourishing. The woman is prospering. The woman has a long life. The woman has long life. The husband of this woman has a long lifespan. The relatives of this woman have a long lifespan. This woman is saying what? The husband of this one has a long lifespan, and the relatives, friends, and so on, of this one are flourishing. What is she doing when she says this? She is offering parched grains.
25.33	The rite is to be performed twice, and then again twice. In order to show this clearly, he says:
25.34-35	The Parayana is the going around of the fire. The Yajamana is the one who is to be benefited. The one who is to do the act is understood. Then the placing of the stone. Having spread there, the sowing of the seeds. The Gandharva is the recognition of the husband. The Gandharvas are the recognition of the husbands. The girl says, "May the Gandharva god, having been worshipped, release me from the houses of that one." The Gandharva holds the earth. The Gandharv is the recognition of her husband. The girl says to another girl, "May the god Agni, having been worshipped by you, release me from my husband's house." The Gandharv holds the earth. This means that the Gandharva is recognized as the husband. The girl who has been worshipped by another girl says, "The god Agni, having being worshipped, may he release me from my own husband's house.
25.36	The meaning is that the teacher recites the mantra beginning with "Soma." "May Soma make me know my relatives. May I be the wife of the living one." It is explained that "Since Soma knows his relatives, may he also make me know my relations through this woman. May I be his wife."
25.37	The third Homa is done with the mantra "Tryambakam yajāmahe" etc. We worship Tryambaka, the fragrant one, the nourisher of the husband, like the Uvaruka fruit from the bondage of death, may I be released from the house of the dead, svāhā. We worship Tryaṃbaka, the auspicious one, by offering oblations. The fragrant one, the one with good fame, the word "gandha" is well-known to mean fame. The nourisher of the lord, the one who nourishes the husband. By the grace of the worshipped Tryaṃbaka may I be released. From what? Like the Uvaruka from the bondage. The Uvaruka is the fruit of the Karīra tree, which when ripe falls from its stalk and is released. Or it is shaken by those who desire it. Similarly, may I be always separated from death. From the house of the husband, may I never be released again. This is a prohibition.
25.40	The meaning is this: When the officiating priest is hired, the blessing of the sacrificer becomes the purpose of the sacrificer. The terms "yoke" and "yoke-strings" are synonyms, and the use of synonyms has the purpose of emphasis. Or, the meaning is: I release the yokes and not only the yokes, but also the yoke-strings, which means ignorance. The meaning is: I know the yokes and the yoke-strings and the fundamental afflictions such as attachment. When the yokes and yoke-strings of the couple are released, the fire on the marriage ground becomes released due to the movement of its own nature, because it is freed from the danger of being obstructed. Therefore, it is released and is requested again as before.
25.41	The performer makes the bride step seven steps towards the east on the darbha grass spread out to the north of the fire, with seven mantras. "Vishnu may follow you." This is to be added at the end of each step. "One step for food, 'Vishnu may follow.' 'Place one step for food.' 'May Vishnu follow you for two steps for strength.' 'Place two steps for strength and power.' As before." "Three steps for prosperity, 'Vishnu follows you.' 'Place three steps for the prosperity of wealth.' 'May four steps be for happiness.' 'Mayah' means happiness. 'Mayah' is that which is for happiness. Place four steps for that purpose. The meaning is that it is for the purpose of seeking happiness." "Five steps for offspring, 'Vishnu followers you.' 'Place five steps for sons and grandsons.' 'May six steps be for the seasons.' 'Place six steps for the sake of the seasons.' The meaning is that the seasons should be connected with fruits facing you." "The seventh step for long life, 'O Sarasvati, may you be friendly. May no one see you in the sky.' 'May Vishnu follows you.' 'May the seventh step be for long life.' 'May these seven steps be for the happiness of the husband.' 'Sarasvati' means 'friendly.' 'May no one see you' means that no one should see you naked or in a place shaken by the wind."
25.42	The creator of the world, having placed the sun in front of the girl, says, "May we see the hundred autumns, may we live the hundred autumns." "Devahitam" means "done by the gods", or "beneficial to the gods". "Sukram" means "white", "Uccarat" means "moving upwards", "Udyat" means "rising".
25.43	If the marriage is performed at night, or if the marriage is performed during the day, then one should establish the fire with this verse "That eye".
25.44	One who desires to marry a living girl should show her to the Guru beginning with Dhruva. Some here continue with "at night", because there is no sight of Dhruva and others during the day. Others do not continue, because the meaning is understood as "When asked 'Do you see what is ahead?' she replies 'I see', even though she does not see." The imperative "see" means only seeing. And here the reply is "I see". The Guru should ask each one by name, and she, when asked, should reply "I see".
25.45	The Guru, having seen the stars Dhruva etc., recites the following Anushtubh verse: "May this bride be auspicious and endowed with good fortune, by your grace. Having come together and seen this, give her good fortune and then set." The Kta suffix is used here. Therefore, this should be known even during the day. Seeing the stars Dhruvat etc. is said to illuminate life. Hence, even when not seen at this time, the reply "I see" is remembered for the purpose of averting untimely death. Therefore, whatever is shown by the stars Dhruvati etc., it is shown for the sake of well-being and non-destruction.
25.46	The four verses beginning with "Udu ttama" are recited to the bride going to her husband's house, facing the north-east direction, towards the house. She should go facing the direction where the house is. "She ascends the highest, as if scattering the enemies, she ascends the head of her husband, and becomes Viraja with offspring." "O bride, make her very virtuous and auspicious, give her ten sons, and make her husband the eleventh." "O Indra, make her very auspicious, give her eleven sons, and make the husband the eleventh." "O bride, be the queen of your father-in-law, be the queen also of your mother-in-law and sister-in-law. Be the queen of your husband's sisters, and be the queen of the gods." "O wife, be the queen, the most venerable, of your father- and mother-in-laws, and be the Viraja of your husband'sajas, of your relatives, of your wealth, of your husband, of your brothers-in-law." "Sajas" means relatives, servants, etc. "Hava" is "chanda" in both ways. In the middle country, it is read as long. "Of your husband's brothers" means everything in the house is under your control. From here onwards, the text ends with "O Agni, you are ours." Here, at the time of going to her husband, the Madhuparka section is recited. It will be explained in the section on the Snata.
26.1	When a bride goes to her husband's house on an auspicious day, she yokes the chariot or palanquin as much as possible. There, in that union, the meaning of the mantra is explained by repetition. She yokes the horse and other animals.
26.2	The Adhvaryu recites the verse "Agni and Maruts" etc. on the wheel of the chariot, or on the side of the wheel, once only. The mantra should be used once, because of the dual form. "Aṅku" means one who moves, "Nyanku" means one who goes down, "Aṅkunyanku" means both Aṅku and Nyanku, which are special movers, by whom the wheel moves. "Aṅkunyanta" means those two Aṅkus and Nyankus are present on both sides of the chariot. "May those Agnis protect us" means may they protect us from the path, or may they lead us across the path. Who are those Agnis? Those who are in the form of darkness, born from wood and other fuels, or those who rush towards the wind. The meaning is that they are in the form such as lightning etc. The Agni who is far away is in the form of distant-moving rays and the sun. The one who is in the form such a Patrinī and Vajini is in the form Patrinī and Vājini. The one who has the form of Patrinī is established in the forms of Garuda and others, and the one who has the Vājini form is based on the forms of barley and others. What kind of Agnis? "Pashya" means "Pree" means those who nourish, or those who fulfill desires. "Patri" is a form of "Pra" in the sense of fulfillment.
26.3	He puts the twig of the Sami tree in the holes of the axle of the chariot, in the holes of yoke and in the holes of other parts of the chariot, saying, "I put the twig in the holes of sky of the axle of chariot; similarly in the holes of yokes, in the holes in the yoke and in the other holes of the chariot. Thus I put the twig of Sami tree in the sky for the sake of peace.
26.4	Thus he makes the bride ascend the chariot. O bride, ascend the chariot. What kind of chariot? One adorned with beautiful palāśa flowers and other flowers arranged by the attendants, one with a beautiful salmali tree, which is naturally moving, or it is called so because it is made of salmali wood, one with various forms, one with a golden color, one surrounded by fruits, flowers, etc., or one with a beautiful wheel, one that is the source of immortality, the cause of the law of immortality, one that causes non-destruction, make it comfortable for your husband. It is called vahantu because it carries.

26.7	The two mantras are explained. "The four of these" is Tristubh. The sutra is clear in meaning. "He recites" is a continuation. "Those who are meritorious people in the cremation grounds, who lie down on corpses, may they enjoy there alone, and may the bride not see them." "In the cremation grounds, on the beds of corpses, those who are meritorious people, yakshas, and those who are shavas, ghosts, may they lie down in those cremation grounds, may they enjoy and have fun there alone, and let the bride not see." "Bride" is a genitive tatpurusha.
26.8	The mantra is also clearly explained.

Let there be salutations to the serpents, whatever they are on the earth, whatever they are in the sky, whatever they are above, salutations to those serpents. To those serpents who are in the Yatudhanas, or who follow the trees, or who lie in the holes, salutations to them.

The sacred places are explained as follows: "The three are called sacred places, by those who have learned the scriptures, the scriptures, the sacred places, and the water frequented by the sages."

27.1	The one with mantras is self-explanatory.
27.2	The meaning is that when some part of the chariot is broken and loose, one should recite the Brihatī hymn beginning with "Ya ṛte" (RV 10.97.1). "Ya ṛta" means "Ya ṛtam" (RV 9.97.2), "Ya ṛtena" (RV 3.53.14), "Ya ṝta" (RV 6.48.1), "Ya Ṛta" (RV RV 10.10.1), "Yo ṛta" (RV "O chariot, you who are separated from the joints, from the bonds, from the destruction, you who have been destroyed before, you who have not been harmed by cutting, you who have perished, you who have fallen apart, you who have become loose, you who have come to ruin, you who have lost your form, you who have gone to ruin, you have been restored by Maghavan, the binder, the one who binds, the one who has many riches, the one who makes the broken whole again." "Ya ṛtena" means "Ya rtena" (RV The meaning is that Maghavan will make you whole again, binding you completely. "The binder" means the one who binds. How will he make you whole? "The broken" means the one whose path is crooked. How is Maghavan the one who has much wealth? "Ci" is a filling word.
27.3	When the sun is in the shade of a tree in the afternoon, and its rays are seen above the trees and not below, then one should go to his house, by the word house his own village is indicated, having gone to near his own village, having seen his own house facing him, he recites the following: "Bearing strength, the giver of wealth, of good understanding, rejoicing, of good radiance, seeing the houses with the benign and friendly eye, we cross over the houses. We cross over the life of the houses. May the houses of ours give us life. I resort to the houses with good minds. The slayer of heroes, the lord of heroes, of good service, bearing food, pouring ghee, in the midst of whom one dwells, one gets much happiness. We invoke the houses, may they know us, may they be truthful, may they be self-sufficient, may they be possessed of food, may they be givers of peace. May the cows, goats, and sheep, and the gravy of food be invoked in our houses. May our friends, of much wealth, be invoked, may they be well-pleased, may they be free from harm, may our houses and all men be always." When the sun is in a tree's shade in the afternoon, its rays are seen only above the trees and nowhere else, then one should proceed to his house. By the word house, his own village is meant. Having gone to near his house, having seen his house facing him, one recites the following:"Bearing strength, the bearer of food, the giver of food, of good understanding," etc. "We cross over the houses" means we cross over the life. "May the houses of ours" means may the houses of ours grant us life. "I resort to the houses" means I go to the houses. "Of good minds" means of pleasing minds. "The slayer of heroes" means the slayer of enemies. "The lord of heroes" means one who has a heroic lord. "Of good service" means of good service. "Bearing food" means bearing food. "Pouring ghee" means pouring ghee. "In the midst of whom" means in the midst of which houses. "One gets much happiness" means one gets much happiness by dwelling in them. "We invoke the houses" means "may they know us". "May they be truthful" means may they be truthful. "May they be self-sufficent" means may they perform the rites of the ancestors. "May they have food" means may they have food. "May they give peace" means may they give peace. "May the cows, goats and sheep" means may the cows, goats etc. "And the gravy of food" means the gravy of food. "Be invoked in our houses" means may they come to our houses. "May our friends" means may our friends. "Of much wealth" means of much wealth. "May they" etc. is as before.
28.1	The grass called Vīraṇa is also called Ulapa, Vīraṇa, and Prāsuṇa. But the words Ulapa and Prāsuṇā are not well-known. In the Madhyadeśa and other places, the grass is known as Vīraṇa only. The priest spreads the row of Vīraṇa grass, starting from the place where the chariot is to be brought down, up to the special room where the bride will sleep.
28.2	Similarly, the groom enters the house with the bride, after descending from the chariot.
28.3	He enters the house, which is furnished with water-pots, with medicines, and with the sacrificial fire, which has been placed in it. After the offering of oblations to the guardian deities of the house, this entry is enjoined. For the Sutra says, 'Having offered the oblation of the Sthalipaka to the guardian deities with the four verses beginning with "O Vastospati, the remover of calamities," one should then enter the house." The first verse is a Gayatri. The remaining three are Tristubh. O Vastospati, O Brahman, be the remover of calamities. O Vayu, be the remover from us of calamities. Be free from disease. Be free from diseases. Be the remover of diseases. The remover of calamities is the remover of diseases; the remover from diseases is the cause of the stability of the absence of diseases. Thus there is no repetition. Be the remover from us. Be the remover. Be the remover for us. Be the giver of prosperity. Be the giver. Be the giver for us. Be free from calamities. Be free. Be free for us. Be without calamities. Be without calamities for us. Be auspicious. Be auspicious. Be auspicious for us. Be prosperous. Be prosperous. Be prosperous for us. Be a giver of prosperity. Be a giver. Be a giver for us. Be without calamities. Be free of calamities. Be free of calamities for us. O Vastospati! May we be united with your prosperity, which is endowed with speed and other qualities, and which is of the nature of happiness. May we be united. May we be connected with the gold and other things. May we be engaged in the activities of sacrifice and other rites. Having made the excellent gift, protect us who are engaged in the attainment of the goal and the preservation of what is attained. May you protect us. May you protect. May you protect.
28.4-5	The moon united with the Rohini or the Mula asterism is to be known. Or, the day which is said to be auspicious in the science of astrology. The Agnihotra fire is to be kindled in the house. The bridegroom, having seated the bride on the skin of a red cow, and himself sitting on the pure Darbha grass, having offered the oblations beginning with the Jaya oblation and ending with the Ajya oblations, which are to be offered in the prescribed order, having performed the rites of the Agnihotra, and having offered the obulations beginning with the Prai-schitta oblations and ending with the Triyagus oblation, and having offered oblations to the gods, the bride and the bridegroom should eat the oblations. The bridegroom should offer the oblations beginning from the Prai-chitta oblations and concluding with the Triyagush oblations, and then the oblations beginning and ending with the Agnihotra oblations. "O Agni, may I accomplish the oblation of the Dakshina-krama. O Agni, may I perform the oblation of Agni, the all-consuming one, who, being in the stomach, consumes all that is eaten, the curd and other things. Of whom? Of the conqueror, the horse, the lord of food, or the lord of food. May it be fragrant for us. May it be the mouth adorned with knowledge and belching. May it be curd. May it be eaten. May it be for us. May our lives be saved. May it be saved. The fifth form is explained."
29.1	Where there is silence, the offering of the oblation, etc., that oblation, being accomplished by its own juice, should be cooked with water, and the fire and Prajapati should be worshipped with a portion of it. The eating of the remaining oblation should be done silently, as in the case of the bride and groom taking food together in one vessel, because eating together is well-known as sahashana. The mantra "Savanam" indicates union. Others, however, do not desire eating together even in this case. Just as the sacrificer and his wife eat the Ida together, and the wives eat together, so the eating of the Ida and the Grihamethiya should be separate, even though the number five and the word "together" are heard together. The repetition of "silently" is for the purpose of prohibiting the Pakayajna. It is said, "In those, the offering is silent." The eating is done with the four Anushtubh verses beginning with "Vivanam" and "Savanam". The utterance of the mantra is for the sake of the oblation. "Vivanam", "Savanam", and "Sambhaktanau" mean food. "Savanam means food. "Sambhaktat" means food eaten together. It is said that food is the life of animals, by which they live. Food is said to be the best and most praised medicine, by which diseases caused by hunger, etc. are removed. The bridegroom says, "O bride, I am binding your heart and mind. "Sin" means binding. "Manan" means mind. "Manute" means it is known by this. The external senses are the five, and the heart is the mind. By what true knot? By the true, unadulterated conduct. It is said to be white, pure, and having the nature of Dharma. Food is like a gem, and life is like a thread. This is the form of a necklace. "O bride, may your mind be with my speech. May your mind be as your words are, without deceit. May your mind not be different from mine, and your speech not different from mine. May our minds be the same, and may our vow and prescribed rites be fruitful." "May your mind follow me, like a bull follows the wheel of a cart. Look at me and the sun alone. Do not have your mind in other men." "May our union be like that of the Cakravaka birds, which, having come together, share the rain, etc., and eat them. May our affection be like that." Thus ends the marriage rite composed by Sri Jalandhari Bhattopenra's son Haripala, the son of Devapala, in the Samantracharayani Grihya-Bhashya.
30.1	The vow is to be observed by each person separately. The first option is for one year. The second option is for the period of youth, which is excessive. The third option is in case of an emergency. The fourth option is to choose between twelve nights, six nights, three nights, or one night.
30.2	The bride and the bridegroom lie on the same bed. This is the first night after marriage. The rite of Ādhāna (kindling of the sacrificial fire) is also done in the same way, along with the recitation of the four mantras.
30.3	These three-footed verses are recited by the bride and groom at the time of the first union and the conception of a child. The first verse is recited by the woman, the second by the groom, the third by the woman, and the fourth by the groom. The inversion is the opposite, because the man is the principal. His action comes first in other cases, but here it is the opposite. The woman is the beginning of the inversion, and that is the inversion of the woman and so on. The groom says, "O son-desiring one, I see you, I see you shining, Chekitana, with divine splendor. With what mind do I see you? What kind of one? Born of austerity, the name of austerity is the good deed of Prajapati. Born from Brahma, Prajapati, and grown from austerity, I desire offspring in the form of a son and wealth. May I obtain offspring." The bride says, "O Prajapati, I desire your body, O Tvashtra! O Prajapati, you, being Indra, have suddenly been followed by all the gods with their strength. Knowing us properly, with the sacrificial ones, the gods, we shall be the mothers of many sons, without a mother." The groom says, “In the plants that end with fruit ripening, I alone place the embryo, the ability to generate fruit. Because there is no difference between the individual soul and the supreme soul, it is said like this. Therefore, it is said, 'I am within all beings.' Within the earth, I generate and shall generate offspring without fault. I generate sons in the wombs of women who are the mothers of the births, and I place the seed."
30.4	The fourth verse is self-explanatory.
30.5	The male organ is touched with the mantra "Karat" (doing), the female organ is touched with "Bhasad" (shining), the male organ is touched again with "Karat" - the meaning is "May I beget offspring."
30.6	The female organ is touched again by the mantra "Bhasad," the meaning is "You are the begetter of offspring, may you be shining and capable of generating the desired effect."
30.7	By this (verse) he puts the semen, which is generated by the great one, into the womb. The meaning is that it should be extensive and capable of generating a son.
31.1-2	From the third month of pregnancy onwards, on the auspicious day of the bright fortnight, the ritual known as "Sīmantonnayana" is performed. This is indicated by the use of the causative form "kurute", meaning "causes to be done". Some people desire this ritual to be performed only on the vessel, saying that the embryo will be benefited by the ritual performed on the vessel, just as the eyes are benefited by the ritual on the golaka. Thus, the Smṛti says, "Women of the twice-born castes, having been sanctified once by Sīmantonnayana, give birth to all their embryos sanctified." Others consider the ritual to be performed on the embryo, as it is logical to say "in the third month of the embryo". If the ritual were performed only on the container, then why would it be performed in the third month of gestation? The Smṛti says "Sīmant should be performed". Others say that the ritual is performed on both. Here, the ritual performed on only the field is considered to be the most approved by the knowers of Vedic meanings, as it is well-known to be performed only once. Having performed the rites from Jayaprabha to Ājyabhāga, and having made the prescribed domestic fire, the hair is completely released towards the rear part of the fire on Darbha grass, with the head facing east. It is clarified by the three verses that are going to be recited, using the wooden instrument called Kaṅkata, which has two sides and is used to remove the teeth, and by the Valaspasthīkaraṇa. The word "iti" is the principal instrument. The verse "The Sīmant that you have made..." means that the Kaṅkata was made by Indra or Śaci. The word "va" is used in the sense of comparison, as in "The ocean is the great being". The verse "The Kaṅkata that Indraṇī..." means that it was made by Indraṇī. Therefore, it is superior. The verse "O Agni, this wife..." means that she is given to her husband again along with progeny. The verse "Agni gave this wife..." means "May her husband live long and live for a hundred autumns". The word "lāṭ" is in the sense of "live".

31.4	Then, when the hair of this pregnant woman is divided into two parts, each going to one side, and is tied with a blue-red thread, the two parts are tied with a blue and red thread. The meaning is that the power of the embryo is manifested and its masculinity is manifested. The relatives of this pregnant woman increase. The meaning is, "May the power be manifested and the relatives increase." And the husband, when the bonds of affection, etc., exist, may be bound.
31.5	The preceptor who performs the ceremony of the application of the parting line of hair should be honoured according to one's ability with offerings such as honey and water.
31.6	At this time itself, the ceremony of removing the hair-knots from the heads of the unmarried girls of the Vāgdatta family should be performed. The anointing with all kinds of ointments, including saffron, which imparts a special beauty, and the parting of the hair, should be done. The principal sacrifice is performed with the fourfold offering beginning with "Agneya ye ke ca" and so on.
32.1	Then, after the ceremony of the parting of the hair, the rite called Pumsavana, which is a rite for the purification of the embryo, should be performed.
32.2-3	The ten months of pregnancy are mentioned in the Veda as ‘in the tenth month the child is born’ and also seen. Among them, the first five months are less, the sixth is more, the seventh is most, the eighth is the most gone among them. When the child is in these months of pregnancy, then in the eighth month, one should cook three oblations of cooked rice according to the practice of the learned. One should offer oblations to Agni, Indra and Vishnu. Taking any one of them, one should offer oblations according to the deity. Where there is one cooked rice oblation, even though there is a difference in the deities, there is one rite due to the oneness of the union of the substance and the deity. Here, due to the difference of both, there is multiplicity of rites due to the difference in the union. With the words ‘Agni stuvi’ one offers to Agni, with the words ‘Indra kshatram’ one offers to Indra, with the words “Pra tam Vishnu’ one offers to Vishnu. Having taken one part from each of the above, one offers to Svistakrit. Agni stuvi, Indra kshatram, Pra tam Vishnu, Puman, Agni stuvi, Agni stuvi. The father gives his son to the giver, who proclaims the imperishable, the most excellent, the most excellent Brahman, the imperishable lord.
33.1	Next is described the rite called Sosyantisavana, which is seen to be useful. The name is formed according to the rule. It is called Sosyantisavana because it is a rite for one who is about to give birth, and is about to give it.
33.2-3	The husband should place the hand of the pregnant woman, which is dripping with water, on her head and touch her heart. If the husband is not present, some other person, such as a god, can do it. The verse says, "With this mantra, he should touch." If that happens, she will give birth quickly and happily. This indicates the purpose of the ritual. Just as the wind blows forcefully and swiftly, or as the ocean surges and shakes, so may your embryo quickly be born, along with the placenta, and come forth.
34.1	When a son is born, the rite of birth is performed. After that, the name is given, after deliberation, saying, "This name will be given." Some explain it thus: "The name should be given on the eleventh day, on an auspicious day," which is mentioned in the Smriti after the purification from impurity. Others say that when the son is born, one should not exceed the eleventh day or the auspicious moment thereafter for the naming ceremony. We shall explain the truth of this in detail.
34.2	At the beginning of the name, the letter should be like the sound, and in the middle, the letter should have the name of the end. Where there are four letters, those are the letters. Here, the letter is not determined because of the absence of the letter "a".
34.3	It should be done according to the sequence obtained by the grace of the deity.
34.4	Where there is a birth, having brought the worldly fire there, having performed the offerings ending with the oblations of ghee there itself, one should pour the drops of the remaining oblations into a bronze vessel containing gold. "Hiranyagarbha" with eight oblations. "Hiranyagarbha" is one oblation. "The image of the year" is the second. "To whom?" "To whom?" and "To which?" and "To Prajapati" are four. "Prajapati, you alone have controlled all these beings." "Whatever desires we offer, may that be ours." "He is the son of so-and-so, he is the son of such-and-such." "May we be the lords of wealth, svāhā." "He is so-and-such" indicates the specific names. "He is Vishnu Mitra, the son of Yajna Mitra." The father and son are mentioned twice. The genitive case ending is used in the middle of the father's name, and at the beginning and end of the son's name. "May we be lords, owners, of wealth."
34.5	Having purified the face of the child with gold, touching the face with the hand moistened with water, the father of the child, in the presence of the mother, recites the following verses: "May Agni be your life." Having washed the child, the priest recites each verse separately, the last one being recited twice. The plural form "nipples" is used in relation to the child. "Madhu" is the name of the nectar that generates the universe and is the essence of eternal bliss, as known from the Madhuvidya. "Madhu Vata" means "Madhu flowing with the wind", "Madhu Ksharanti Sindhavah" means "Madhus flow from the rivers", "Madhvi Nasantu Osadhaya" means "May the herbs be sweet", "Madhu Naktam Utosasa" means "May night and dawn be sweet", "Maddhi Parthivam Rajah" means "May earth be sweet", "Dyauस्तु No Pita" means "May heaven be our father", "Madhumaan No Vanaspatir" means "May trees be sweet", "May the sun be sweet to us", "May the cows be sweet to us". "Rta" means "sacrifice", "Yajna" means "sacrifice". "Rtayascha" means "desiring sacrifice", "Shatranta" means "desirous of sacrifice". "May the wind be sweet to the sacrificer". "Sindhavah" means rivers, "Madhu" means sweet water. "May the herbs flow". "Osadhaya" means herbs, "Madhvi" means sweet. "May the fruits be sweet". "Naktam" means evening, "Utosasa" means dawn. "May the earth be sweet to us" means the world of earth. "May heaven be sweet". "May the trees be sweet". "The sun may be sweet to us." "May the cows of us be sweet." "May the sweet cows be sweet.
34.6	The father, having rubbed the golden vessels with honey, makes the child drink it. Some think that the vessels should be rubbed with honey and then made to drink. Since the rites of the father are performed at the time of birth, the father says, "O child, drink the life-giving nectar, drink thus, drink the aging nectar." The ghee or honey-mixed milk that is being drunk is the cause of your life and so on. Energy is food, strength is prosperity, wealth is nourishment, the prosperity of Vedic and other knowledge is brahminical splendor.
34.7	The Bodha and Pratyubodha are the verses of instruction. The rest is clear. May the Bodha and Pratyu-boda protect me from the east, the Asvapna and An-avadra-na from the south, the Gopayama and Rak-sama from the west, the Jagrivi and Arundhati from the north. May Indra protect us from the south, may he protect us from the west, may he protect from the north. The gods who are the bearers of the body, may they protect my body here. The gods who bear the body, may those gods protect my body here.
35.1	For the protection of the child and the woman in childbirth, these oblations are offered during the period of impurity. Therefore, they are only for the seen purpose. The Kambukas are the oblations. One should offer sesame seeds mixed with them, using a ladle, every evening and morning for ten days, with the four mantras beginning with "Shanda". The meaning of the collective statement is that Shanda and others should perish and flee from the place of the woman in childbirth. Shanda, Marka, Upvita, Tounduleya, and Ulukhala are the names of demons. Each mantra is related to one of them. "May Shanda perish from this place." Similarly, "May Marka, Upvida, Tounduley, and Ulukhal perish from this place. May it be well-offered." "May the one who writes and erases, the one who speaks, and Ulukha perish from this place" "May it be well-protected." This is the same as the previous one. "May the one with the eyes of a lion, the one with the pot, the one with power, the killer, and the one with the face of a pot perish from this place". "May Keshi, the one with hair like a dog, Kacha, Kaucha, and the one who shines perish from this place"." "May the one named Keshi, the demoness, and the one named Kesha, the one with dog-like hair, Kacha, Kacha, and the one shining perish from this place"
35.2	One should offer oblations for ten days in this manner. The meaning is that one should offer oblations until the period of impurity is over.
36.0	Now, the naming ceremony.
36.1	When the tenth day has passed, and the impurity is purified on the eleventh or twelfth day, if there is a defect in the constellation or other factors, the naming ceremony should be performed on the tenth or twelfth day, as it is remembered that it should be done on an auspicious day, at an auspicious time, or in a constellation endowed with good qualities. And because the thirteenth day is taken by the rule of the rising moon, not by the rule of rising from the bed and going to bed at an improper time, etc., as it is said, "In the remaining part of the night by two, in the morning by three," and because it is seen that impurity continues until sunrise even when the night has passed, Having bathed the newborn in the same fire of childbirth in the delivery room, along with all herbs and other fragrant substances, and with the auspicious fruits of mango and betel nut placed above, and having covered it with a cloth that has not been used, he offers oblations with the oblations related to that pot-cooked rice, alternating with the pot-cooked rice. He offers five oblations, saying, "By what wonderful (means)..."
36.2	The repetition of the words "Agner āyuḥ asi" etc. is similar to the Ayus-ishtya. The limit is mentioned up to touching the forehead. "He touches the forehead of the sacrificer and murmurs 'Pranah of the Asvins' (10). This will be stated later. After that, it is similar to the Aayus-ishttya. This is the meaning.
36.3	Here in this Anuvaka, in place of "asau", the same name is mentioned which was done in the Jatakarma, not any other.
36.4	Some others say that the two names are prescribed separately. For a Brāhmaṇa there are two names to be prescribed. The purpose of the secret name mentioned in the rite of birth is not to utter it when the enemy is performing sorcery. The public name is used from the eleventh day onwards. Thus the Veda says, “Therefore a Brāhmaņa has two names.”
36.5	Having first poured the purified ghee into a bronze vessel and then thrown it in, and having thrown gold into it, he should bind the gold in the form of a thread, suitable to be bound around the neck of the child, with the mantra "Agne, you are the life..." and offer it into the ghee with the five mantras beginning with "Indra's life..."
36.6	Before the offering of the established Yajus, Brahma places gold in ghee and holds it. All the priests hold it with the mantra "What is held in ghee for the purpose of binding the young neck and so on."
36.7	After reciting "From ghee, gold with Pavamana," he gives it to the sacrificer with the mantras "The gods are long-lived" and so on.
36.11	By reciting the verse "From limb to limb" etc. and touching the head of the child, he recites the benedictory verse. In some places, the reading is "By touching the head". In that case, it is said that the Ni affix is used in the sense of the self, and the mother is employed in the presence of the father. Some say that the priest is the one who employs the father.
36.12	Therefore, when the father returns from a journey after the naming ceremony, he should touch the head of the child in this manner. Similarly, on the birth anniversary every month, the head should be touched with ghee in the manner of the Jaatakarma ritual, using a pot of cooked rice. This practice should be followed for a year.
36.13	The mother and father of a child should not eat meat for a year.

What is hell according to the Vedas
37.1-2	When two months have passed from the time of birth, and the first half of the third month has elapsed, the child should be shown the sun. Here is the procedure: On an auspicious day, when the astrological texts are pure, or on a festival day, when there is a favorable conjunction of stars, etc., the child should be made to see the sun. Since it is seen that one festival day is optional with the collection of other days, it is understood that there is a superior excellence. When the sun has risen, having smeared a spot the size of a chariot wheel, in the courtyard of the house adorned with the rays of the sun, having installed the worldly fire there as prescribed, having performed the prescribed rites of sprinkling, sweeping, arranging, sprinkling, covering, sanctifying, melting the ghee, examining the ghee, and attending the fire, then having offered oblations with the verses beginning with "Jaya" and ending with "Aghaara", he offers ghee with the four verses "Tarani Vishvadarshate", "Divo Rukma", "Udu Tyam", and "Chitram Devanam".
37.3	"He offers" is connected. With the two verses, "Mitra, the friend of men" and "He is the friend of men," he offers the Sthalipaka oblation.
37.4	Turning the boy towards him with the mantra beginning with "Come back," the father or the preceptor raises him up.
37.5	The father of the child makes the child face the sun and places him on his lap with the mantras beginning with "Salutations to the seer, salutations to the sub-seer."
37.6	The Brahmins should be fed with food mixed with ghee, curd, etc. O Sun, you are the Tāraṇi, the illuminator of the world, the light-giver, illuminating everything. You are the Prajāpati's Arṣa (verse). The Gāyatrī is the deity. O Sun, you are indeed the Tāraṇī, the one who saves from the ocean of worldly existence. Thus, you are the illuminator of all, the one who removes the darkness. You illuminate everything that shines. You are the entire Prajāpati in the form of light. The golden one with far-reaching eyes rises from heaven, shining, the Tāraṇy, the one who accomplishes. Indeed, people are born by the Sun. He makes things happen, the waters. He is the one who makes things happen, moving swiftly. He is the Sun, rising from afar, moving from afar. He is the Prajāpati, the one who moves from heaven, from the sky. The golden one is the one with far-seeing eyes. The one who accomplishes is the one who accompleshes. The one who makes things happens is the one who causes things to happen. The one who moves swiftly is the one who moves swiftly. The one who is the Sun is the one who rises from afar. The one who rises from heaven is the one who is the Prajāpate. O Mitra, may the mortal who follows your vow be prosperous. He is not killed or defeated. No one harms him. He is not far away. O Mitra, O Sun, the mortal who follows the vow of your vow, he may be prosperous. He may be prosperous. The one who follows your vow is not killed by anyone. He is not defeated. No one causes harm to him. He is near, not far away. The horses of this Sun, the rays, are not seen. The shining ones shine like fires, following the people. The horses of this Sun are the rays. They are not seen. They are shining. They shine like fires. They shine following the people.
38.1	The word "evam" indicates the extension of the rite up to the smearing of the ground with the size of a chariot wheel. He says the special feature.
38.2-5	The worship of the moon should be done with the mantra "New, new..." The mirror should be given as dakshina. "The moon grows from the nectar, being born with words, the protector of the earth. May it grant life, offspring, nectar, and good fortune. The moon shines for a long time." The moon grows from the amrita, being born with the words of the protector of the Earth. May it grant long life, offspring, the quality of being immortal, and good fortune, i.e., being liked by the world. The repetition of "long life" is for emphasis. The moon, being born from the amrita at the beginning of the lunar fortnight, grows day by day. "May your streams and riches come together, may your strength and prowess come together. O Soma, being nourished by us, may you become immortal, for heaven." Give the best of food, the signs of the days and nights, and the foremost share. The new moon comes to the foremost share, giving the share to the gods. The moon, growing at the beginning of each lunar fortnight, becomes new, new. It comes to the foremost of the days and the nights, being the sign of the time beginning with the new moon. It gives a share to the gods, because it is made of amrita. The moon shines, saying "May long life come together."
39.1	From the sixth month after birth, the child should be fed with solid food.
39.2	Having offered twice with the two verses "May all the sacrificial foods be mixed together" and "May the life-giving god", one should make the child eat food with the mantra "O lord of food, give us food". "May the life giving god, wearing old age, wearing ghee, having ghee as his back, Agni, drinking ghee, the beautiful, may he lead this child to old age, like a father leads his son." "O Agni, the giver of ghee, the giver of immortality, the beautiful, drinking ghee, may he lead the child to old age." "Like a father leads his child." "O shining god, you are the giver of life. Therefore, wearing old age and increasing, wearing ghee and covering, having ghee as your back, being offered with the ghee that is above, being connected with the ghee that moves above, may he lead to old age." The Agni who is the giver of ghee and has ghee as his back is described. "May the green ones carry you, O Agni, who are the giver of ghee. May you drink ghee and worship the gods." For it is through Agni that the gods are satisfied. "O lord of the food, give us the food that is free from disease and nourishing. May you be the giver, the protector, and give us strength to the two-legged and four-legged." "O lord of nourishment, give us food, free from disease and nourishment, the giver, the savior, may you save us from the suffering of the ocean of worldly existence, and give us food and strength to the two legged and four legged, such as cows and horses." This is the eating of food.
40.1	When the third year from birth has passed, the Tonsure ceremony should be performed. The seventh month is more than half, and the eighth is more than that. When that has passed, it should be performed in the ninth month. The Tonsure ceremony should not be performed by the father himself, even if he is learned. This is stated in the Niṣṭhāgaṇḍī.
40.2	The Kapija-s should have their tuft on the right side of the head. The Kapija -s belong to the Vasishtha gotra. The tuft should be on the right side. The tuft is on the right side for those who belong to the right side, the beginning and the beginning of the beginning.
40.3	The tuft should be made for those born in the Atri and Kashyapa gotras on the right and left sides of the head.
40.4	The Bhrigu-s should have no tuft. They should be shaven.
40.5	Those born in the Angirasa lineage should have five-knotted hair.
40.6	Some desire the horse of the Angirasas, which is a row of hair.
40.7	Those who are born in the families of Agastya, Visvamitra, and others, and who are not mentioned in the above list, are called Shikhin. Why are they so called? For auspicious reasons. The absence of hair on the head is an inauspicious custom, a cause of misfortune. Thus it is said: "This head is impure, which is without hair." And also: "Where arrows fall, like the arrows of young men." The remembrance of the act of cutting hair, which is the root of censure and dispute.
40.8	Or, the one-tuft etc. may be done without transgressing the duties of the family, because the practices of the family are remembered as duties. “By that path by which his fathers went, by that path by which the grandfathers went, one should go by that path of the good, going by that path one does not perish.” (Manu 4.178)
40.9	The meaning of the verse beginning with "Puṇyāha" and ending with "Hūṃ" has been explained by the verse beginning with "Ayam agāta". The hot water is sprinkled with the mantra. The metre is Jagatī. The deity is Viśvedevas. The initiation is completed with the Brāhmaṇa. This Savitā has come with the hot water and the razor. O Vayu, you also come with them. O Ādityas, Rudras, Vasus, with consciousness, with one mind, you also shave this boy, as if he were a king, like Soma. The meaning is that you shave him. Because of the statement "Soma is the king of plants", they consider him worthy of respect like a king and shave him.
40.10	He should sprinkle the head of the boy with water enchanted with the mantra beginning with "Hot and cold" and ending with "for prosperity". The meaning is that he should sprinkle the head with water enchanted with this mantra. O waters, may you all, hot and cold, gather together and protect this boy right here. May Brihaspati and Savitar also consent to this protection. What kind of one? One who has true dharma, for his dharma is indeed true. His intention is true because of this. O waters, be the givers of moisture, be the giviers of moisture. The word "giver" is derived from the root "da" with the suffix "anu". Be the givers of life, be the giuers of life. May the waters that sprinkle and moisten give life, long life, and longevity for the sake of offspring. For prosperity, for brahminical splendor, for a special form.
40.11	Having placed a darbha grass on the right side of the head with the mantra "O herb, protect him," and having placed the razor with the mantra "May the razor not harm him," and having held the darbha grasses, the hair should be cut in the four anuṣṭubh verses beginning with "By whom he was cut" and so on, starting from the right side and going clockwise. The ritual should be performed in each direction with each mantra. The first verse should be recited on the right side, the second on the west side, the third on the north side, and the fourth on the front. "O herb, save this boy, protect him. O razor, may it not harm this boy. By whom he was cut, by whom he was cut. By whom Savitrā, the king of Soma, Varuna, was cut, by that, O Brahman, today cut and shave this boy's head. What kind of Savitrā is the wise one? Cut in such a way that this boy may live long, attain old age, and have long life. May he have long life and be able to see old age." The name "he" is specifically mentioned. By whom Dhātā, by whom Prajāpati, by whom Brhaspati, by whom Agni, by whom Indra, was cut, for long life, by that same razor, cut the boy's head for long life and fame, for well-being, for immortality. By whom Pūṣan... The meaning is understood by the subsequent name. By whom the night became longer and the sun could be seen more, by whom the night cut the sun again and again, for a long time, and could be seen, the night sees more. By that... and so on, it is the same.
40.12	The person who shaves gives the razor to the barber with the verse, "With the razor which is of iron." The word "iron" is a particular kind of weapon. Others say that the word "razor" itself indicates that it is of iron. Therefore, the word "iron" has been used for the purpose of praise. The meaning is, "With the best razor which has the qualities of sharpness etc." The word "yena" is a singular form of the third person. The meaning is "O barber, with the razor which has the best and beautiful qualities, with which you shaved the hair of the one who is being shaved, with which you are turning, may your life not be lost. The meaning is 'may he not die'. What then? Bind his head, purify his head.
40.13	With this Brihatī verse he recites over the falling hair. This is your well-known form, etc. May the hair not fall behind the hair. Thus may Prajapati Dhātā give you radiance. Thus may Indra, Brihaspati, and Savitā bestow radiance and form on you.
40.14	The rule is that the hair should be plucked by a friend. When they are being plucked, shaved, and falling, he collects them in green cow-dung. He collects them properly, accepts them, and mixes them with green cow-dung and makes them into a ball. This is the practice in some places.
40.15	With this Vaisvadevya (hymn) in Tristubh metre, he anoints the hair of the sacrificer going towards the east, with Mitra leading the way. The sacrificer, having shaved his head, having shaved it, finds out many places where the hair belonging to Varuna, the king, are deposited. Where are they? In the space between heaven and earth. Who are they? Soma, the moon, Dhata, Prajapati, Savitar, the sun, Vishnu, Agni, Avasi. Each is connected with them. Avasi means protection. One who desires protection. The affix 'kyac' is added. The meaning is 'one who desires protection'.
40.16	The text, “He makes his hair cling to the body of the friend in the cold region of the grass-like plants, etc., which are not empty,” shows that this rite is based on the Veda. This is indicated by the text beginning with “Where arrows fall down like young boys with arrows.”
40.17	The sacrificer gives the fee to the officiating priests according to his ability. They say that a cow four years old is the fee here.
40.18	The recipient of the water offering gives a sesame seed vessel wrapped in fine wool.
40.19	In the Chudakarana, the designation of the limbs and the non-mention of the principal (offering) indicate that the principal offering should be made with ghee, either to Agni or to Visvedevas. Some say that the principal offering is mentioned by the words "having brought together", and that is the principal offering. For those for whom the bringing together is only the sanctification of the fire, the principal offering is done first. Thus ends the Chudakarani.
41.1	The ceremony of wearing the girdle is the principal one, because it is only after this that one is entitled to study the Veda and observe the Smrti rules. Hence it is called the second birth. It is said in the Smrti: “The first birth is from the mother, the second from the binding of the girdle. Here the mother is Savitri, the father is the teacher.”
41.2	The son of a king is called a Rājanya. The Upanayana ceremony for him is to be performed in the tenth year from his birth.
41.3	It is similar to that of the Brāhmaṇa.
41.4	In all cases, the Upanayana ceremony for the Brāhmaṇas is to be performed before the sixteenth year, for the Kṣatriyas before the twenty-second year, and for the Vaiśyas before the twenty fourth year.
41.5	The boy having come, he having bathed, having his hair shaved, having his head shaven, having placed the boy in the prescribed manner, having placed the fire, having placed the white plaster on the ground, having placed the ghee, having sprinkled, having spread, having brought the staff, girdle, etc., according to use, having offered oblations with the verses beginning with "Jay" and ending with the asterisms, etc., having placed the new garment in his hand, he recites the following mantra: "This is the sequence of the garment's origin. First, the cotton is beaten with the Revati verses and the Lotanika verses, then it is made, wrapped, and made into thread, then it is stretched by the weaver, then it is rubbed with the wool, then the weaver weaves the cloth, and when the cloth is completed, ten edges are joined. This sequence is praised here by attributing the agency of beating, etc., to the specific deities of cotton, etc. "O cloth, the Revati deities beat you with special beating. The Krittika deities beat you in the state of cotton with Lotanika, etc. The Krittikas are the agents of wrapping. They made the thread. They made it by that means. The Apas, the Maruts, stretched you with special stretching. They made you into the form of stretching. The Dhios made you with special intelligence. The stretching of the cloth is accomplished by the special intelligence. The Gnas rubbed you with the wool. The wool is the instrument of rubbing. The Gnas are the agents of rubbing. They made the rubbing. They bound the edges of the thousand edges on both sides. The word 'nipat' means 'thus'. The word 'sahasra' means 'abundance'. The Gnas bound the edges of a thousand edges. The Gnas, the serpent deities, made the middle of the cloth. The word 'nu' is a word for speed."
41.6	With this mantra he makes the boy put on the garment. "O goddesses, Revati and others, this garment is being put on. Put it on for which god, for the shining boy. You also, O boy, put it on. Put it." "O Savitar, this garment is put on. For Savitar, the deity, the bestower of knowledge, for the boy. You also put it on. Having become Savitar, O garment, lead and bring this boy to which Brahman, to the state of a Brahman, endowed with the prosperity of the Veda, is the meaning. Make him live for a hundred years. Do this." This is the common mantra for putting on the lower garment of the three castes. The upper garment will be described as the antelope skin. "He recites the mantras beginning with 'May you go to old age' for the boy who has put on the garment." This is the view of the Adityadarsana. The practice of the teachers is not like this, nor is the indication of the mantras like this. The mantras are to be used differently. Each of the three mantras is for putting on each garment. Among them, one is common to all three castes, namely, 'O goddesses, for the god'. The second, 'May you go into old age', is common for putting on. The three beginning with 'The supreme' are each for one garment in order. Thus, each of the three mantrams is for putting on one garment.
41.7-8	The preceptor says to him, “O boy, put on this garment.” He says, “May you go to old age.” “May you become old and worn out.” “May you be long-lived.” “May you have long life.” “May you live a hundred autumns.” “May you enjoy a hundred autumns” means “May you live for a hundred years.” “May you protect the uncensured” means “May he protect the uncensurable, the absence of censure, the absence of sin.” “May you possess a hundred years” means “May your life be long.” “May you wear the garment for splendour, for greatness, for honour, for the protection of the good, for help, for the sake of the ear, for the Veda, for the study of the Veda, for understanding the Veda, for practising the Veda.” “May you sleep long” means “May there be long sleep.” “May you wake up long” means “may there be long waking.” “May you eat long” means “there may be long eating.” “May you drink long” means “There may be long drinking.” “May you go long” means “Let there be long going.” “May you come long” means “let there be long coming.” “May you stay long” means “long staying.” “May you sit long” means “Long sitting.” “May you lie long” means “Lying long.” “May there be a long life for you” means “May life be long.” The preceptor says, “O boy! Put on this garment.” “May you put on this garment” means “May we put on this garment”. “May you put it on” means “May it be put on”. “May you wear it” means “May I wear it”. “May you be put on” means “I may be put on”.
41.9	The teacher, beginning from the navel and ending at the head, anoints the student with the mantra "This is my vow" and so on. The meaning is: "O student, I give you my heart for my ritual. May your heart be a companion in the rites I desire to perform." The meaning is: May your heart be in accordance with my heart. May your heart follow my heart. The meaning is that your heart should be in accordance with mine. May your heart accord with my heart. The teacher says, "May you enjoy the speech that belongs to me, becoming one with the vow. May you study with one-pointed mind what I am teaching." The meaning is, "May you study with one mind what I am instructing." Speech is Brihatī. Its husband is Brihaspati. May he direct you through the gate of proper resolve, may he engage you in serving me and so on. For me, for my sake. If it is so for me, then the teacher's accomplishment will be beneficial.
41.10	The student says, "I have performed the Brahmacharya," and the teacher says, "You have performed the Brahmacarya." Having eaten three times the curd, the teacher, having used the student to eat, and having washed, the student says, "You performed the Brahmacharyam." The meaning is that he is reciting what was recited by the teacher. "I have performed what was done by Dadhikravan, the conqueror, the horse of the sun, the wind-blown. May it make our mouths fragrant, may it lead our lives to the other shore." This is explained as "I have performed Brahmacharya." The student says, "O teacher, I have performed Brahmacharyam, I have come to the feet of the Veda, I have attained, I have performed the Brahmacya as something that must be done. Therefore, please initiate me," meaning "please sanctify me." The Lot suffix is used in the request. The teacher says, "O initiator, your success as a teacher will be the fruit. Please sanctify me," indicating it with the reflexive pronoun. Aditya Darshan has explained this. The teacher says this: "Brahma Prajapati, I have come, I have attained his feet, the state of Brahma. Therefore, please bring me to Brahma," meaning "bring me to the presence of Brahma." The student says, etc. This is to be contemplated. "Om" is the name of Brahma. "Om" means Brahma. "Bhuvar" means the deities residing in the Bhuvar world are described as Agni. "Bhuvah" means the deities of the Antarikṣa world are as before because of their existence there, and that is Vayu. "Svar" means the deities in the Svarga world are described as being in the form of the Sun.
41.11	The teacher, reciting the Tristubh verse "This is the girdle, etc.," puts on the girdle. The student says, "The teacher recites." This girdle, being bound, prevents the rashness of speech, hands, and feet, and by the injunction of restraint, it purifies the three castes, Brahmana, etc., by removing their impurities, or it purifies their form, etc., or it purifides the naturally pure, or it putifies the worthy of purification. It came to me, giving strength to the vital airs, by means of recitation, etc. "Bhanja" means crushing. It destroys the form consisting of the castes, for when it is true, recitation is done, and that recitation is done by restraining the vital airs, so the strength of the vital airs is removed by it. The goddess, having the qualities of illumination, etc., is auspicious, pleasing, associated with fresh soft grass, the protector and guardian of truth and reality. When it is true, it prevents one from speaking as one wishes. It is the protector of the Vedas, etc., when the girdle is bound, by going to the places of the Veda-knowers. It is the ferry, the savior, the one who takes one to the other shore, the destroyer of Rakshas, the destroyer of the Yatudhanas, because of the statement "The girdle is indeed a thunderbolt." It is the one who withstands, the one who overcomes, the one who prevents the weakness and enemies. It says to us, "Come to us from all directions." "Come with good conduct." "O Girdle, may we, your supporters, not be harmed. You are the daughter of faith, the daughter of asceticism, born of asceticism, asceticism is your father. You became the sister of the sages who perform mantras and know true knowledge." "O Girde, you who are like this, please protect me." "Lila" means tasting. There is a variant in the verse. "Embracing me," means "bestowing asceticism and regulated study upon me," and "bestowing upon me the control of the six senses."
41.12	The rope is made of seven strands of muñja grass, and is wound in three layers. The three-layered vajra, the three-layered nine-layered, there the three-layered yūpa is surrounded. In the beginning, the three-layers of the rope, the three-layer meter, the three-fold stoma, etc., the word "three-fold" here refers to the nine-layered. The three-layer meter refers to the three-layered rope. Similarly, due to good conduct, some have explained the nine-layered girdle due to confusion. The name "mūrva" refers to a particular grass, its modification is mūrva, which is the bowstring. The king gives the bowstring, which is the extension of the bow, to the warrior. The silk one is given to the vaishya. Although it is a general name, it is given in accordance with the Smriti, the one made of cotton thread is given in the beginning. The sequence is to be understood as "then it should be tied".
41.13	Having tied the girdle-knot with the mantra "Thou art equal to the mind," he gives the skin of the black antelope to the Brahmana, the skin of the tiger to the Kshatriya, and the skin of the Ruru to the Vaishya. The mantras for the girdle-knot and the giving of skins are common to all three. "Thou art equal" means "Thou art equal in mind to the mind of the Brahmachari, who stands firm in purity due to vows and study." "Thou art divine" is a praise, meaning "Thou art related to the gods." "Do not be loose, do not be free." "Of the friend" is in Tristubh metre. "This skin of the antelope I have put on." "What kind?" The eyes of the antelope and the Ruru are well-known. In the case of the tiger also, the tiger is a friend, and the skin is given as desired by the king, and because of the recollection of valour, it is a support. "For strength" is for the ability to observe Brahmacharya. "For brilliance" is because brilliance is the cause of Brahmic lustre. "For fame" is for the one who makes fame. "For the aged" is for the vessel of respect, or for the more stable one. "For prosperity" is for the cause of prosperity. "For the non-striking" is for the prohibition of striking. "For the one who wears" is for the covering. "For the moving" is for the behaviour of going. "For the horse" is for the food, since it is known to be present in it. When it is worn, the food is given with devotion during the state of Brahmacharya, and its foodness is considered.
41.14	He makes the Adityas present themselves by means of the verse, "That eye, the divine, the bright, which shines forth in front, may we see a hundred autumns, may we live a hundred autumns." That eye shines forth in front of the three worlds, in the eastern direction. It shines forth, it rises, it is directed, it is created by the gods, or it is for the benefit of the gods or the senses. "May we see a hundred years" and "may we live a hundred years" - the student recites this while standing before the sun.
41.15	The teacher said, "Who is your name?" The name of Prajapati is "Ko". Thus, in the Brahmana, it is said, "Who was the name? Prajapati was the name." Due to being inclined towards grasping the Vedas, he is like Prajapati. This question is directly asked through the method of praising. When asked by the teacher, the disciple greets by uttering his own name. When it is said, "He is so-and-so," the name should be understood. "I am Vishnu Mitra, I greet you, O Venerable One." When greeted by the student, the teacher replies, "May you be long-lived, O Gentle One." This is said according to the Smriti that says, "One should greet a non-Brahmin with 'May you be long lived.'" And also according to the Smrti that says, "The last syllable should be lengthened."
41.16	The preceptor takes the right hand of the pupil with his right hand, according to the rules of marriage, and says, “O Brahman-student, I, the preceptor named Harisharma, am taking you in.” Having thus addressed the pupil by his own name, the preceptor, holding his hand, says, “He is one.” The word “one” is for the instruction of the pupil; the second is for the indication of the name of the preceptor. “I am taking your hand, of what kind? Of the kind that shines with the qualities of light, etc., of the kind that produces the knowledge of the meaning of the words of Savita. For what purpose? For the generation of excellent knowledge, etc.” In praise of this, he says, “Not thus is it to be taken, i.e., with the hands made of skin, belonging to me, with the arms made of skin, or with the hands made out of skin.” What then? “I am taking the hand of the kind that is held by the hands of the two divine physicians Ashvins, and of the kind that belongs to the god Pushan.” The preceptor, having taken the hand, says, Savita, the producer of the desired, has taken your hand. The preceptor himself serves as Savita. Agni is the preceptor of you. I am not. I myself am Agni, being the preceptor of yours, because of the burning by means of the knowledge of the Veda and its practice, etc. Who is Prajapati? I am taking you, who are Prajapati himself, in the form of the self.” This one named Vishnu-mitra is the best among all. He alone is purified by the removal of the faults of the body. “I am giving you to Prajapati for protection. I am offering you to Brahma.” When the preceptor asks, “Of which Prajapati are you a Brahman-student?” the pupil replies, “I am a Brahman-student of Prajna.” The reply is given by the preceptor himself.
41.17	O Brahmachari, I give you to Brahma, the protector, to the god Savitar, to the inner self, to Brihaspati. Speech is Brihatī, its lord is the self. I give him to that. This is for showing the name of the teacher. O god, shining by your own nature, O Savitar, the producer of desired vows, this Brahmachari is related to you. Protect him, may he live long, may he not die. The Vedic injunction of indirect indication even in the presence of the direct object is seen here. The Rig Veda is Agni's son, the Yajur Veda is Vayu's son, and the Sama Veda is Surya's son. O Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, and Sama Veda, this Brahmachary is given to you for protection. He is related to each of you. Therefore, protect him. Thus the Brahmana shows the sonship of Agni and others. "It is said, 'Prajapati was alone. He performed austerities. From his austerities, the three gods were born - Agni, Vayu, and Aditya. They performed austerities. For them, from their austerities, the Vedas were born - the Rig Veda from Agni, the Yajur from Vayu, and the Sama from Aditya.' Or, the son is one who protects many. Agni is also a son. Thus in other cases also, the application is seen." Now the teacher instructs him with the hand, saying, "O Brahmachari, you have now become a Brahmachari. Understand that these five things are to be done: Drink water, perform speech control when prompted, perform the duties of serving the teacher, studying the Vedas, etc., and avoid daytime sleep. By my grace, accept daytime sleep when the body is in a state of ease, because the desire for it is independent. Also, control speech. Do not speak untruth or harsh words."
41.18	The five verses beginning with "May the intellect be mine" and the sixth verse are spoken by the disciple and recited by the teacher. The intellect is the foremost among the Kusha grasses. The internal winds, namely, the vital airs Prana, Apana, Samana, Vyana, and Udana, given by the Angirasas, may they give me the intellect. The internal winds are the Angirasas. The seven sages beginning with Vasishtha may give me the intellect in this way. This is common in both verses. The intellect that is among the Apsaras, the mind that is among the Gandharvas, the divine intellect that directly perceives the meaning of the Vedas, and the human intellect that exists in this world, may all of it enter me, may it enter my body. May I be wise and learned. The speech that is in the form of the Vedas and is sweet, may it yield sweet fruits. May I listen to what has been heard, retained, and listened to by me. May what has been spoken by the teacher be pleasing to me. May I be able to repeat what the teacher has spoken. May we be fond of what has been heard. May our hearing be concluded. We shall determine with intellect. With reference to the Self, the disciple says this in the form of a Yajus: "O Antaratman, O Prana and others, I have grown, I shall grow, and you also have grown." That Prana and others will also excel through studying the Vedas. "O gentle one, you are Prana, the thread of the universe. Therefore, protect me. You are the essence of Brahman. The heard (by me) may not be abandoned. The heard (of me) may not leave me." Here, the fourth case is used. The Anushtubh verses are as follows: "I have grown," etc. is the sixth Yajus.
41.19	The Homa-offerings called Anupravacaniya are so called because they are performed after the Savitri-recitation. Or, they are so called because the Guru performs them after the Anupravacaniya-recitation. Here the teacher recites the Mantras and the disciple repeats them. These Homa-offer ings are performed with the four Mantras mentioned above and with the following ones, "May Medha be mine" etc., in accordance with the principle of the Kapinjala-adhikaranam. Some say that the fifth offering is made with the highest Yajus, as stated in the verse beginning with "Avridha". Others say that in this case, the fifth verse would not be applicable, and the use of the feminine form "uttamam" would not be proper, as the Anupravacanīya is masculine, and it is in relation to that that the highest is mentioned. Also, the word "hutim" is not mentioned here. Therefore, the meaning is that one should offer the fifth Anupravac aniya with the highest verse joined with the Yajus. The sixth Anupravacania Homa is mentioned as follows: "One should offer with the name of the rite." This is the seventh Anupravacanya Homa. How should it be offered with the name of a rite? It should be offered in the manner in which the rite is performed, in the manner in whicn the prescribed rite is performed. With the fourth case ending, with the word "svaha", and with the capacity to express, one should offer with the names of the rites. "For taking up, svāhā" or "For Upanayana, svāhā". All the rites mentioned in the Vedas should be offered in this way. All the rites mentioned in the Vedas should be performed with their own names, by offering "For the Vedas, svāhā", and in the manner of "For the Trividyaka, svāhā"
41.20	The teacher, seated on the Darbha grass behind the fire, facing east, recites the Savitri verse to the disciple seated facing him, three times, beginning with "That Savitri" and ending with "Savitri". It should be known that this is for a Brahmana. This is an indication, for other verses are to be recited by the Rajanya and Vaishya according to Smriti and good conduct. "By the Savitar who is not to be injured" - this is explained. "Protect us today, O Savitar, from injury, from the wicked, from the ill-wisher." "The wise one releases all forms, the good for the two-footed and the four-footed." "Savitar, the desirable one, has spread out the sky, shining without moving from the Usha." "These should be recited by the Raja and Vaishya in order. O Savitar, protect us today, protect our house, protect us with the protectors, with the rays that are not to be injured, with the auspicious ones that bring happiness. Since you are golden-tongued, with bright rays, for the new one who gives the oblation, for the creator of praise, you act like a boat. Therefore, protect us. May no one tell us what is evil. He who is the thief, etc., may he be powerful. Savitar releases, illuminates all forms, all states. The wise one, the intelligent one, the one with penetrating vision, generates, produces the good for the bipeds and the quadrupeds. The sky, the heaven, is explained, is spread out, is illuminated. The desirable one, the one to be chosen, the one to pray to, shines, having marked or diminished the movement of the Usha, the nights, due to the removal of the darkness of night.
41.21	This is the Palasha staff. It is straight, without any branches, and without any holes. It is smeared with ghee and held by the teacher with his own hand. The teacher places the student in the shade of the staff and teaches him to recite the Palasha. The teacher says, "O Sushrut, you are Sushrut. He who has good hearing is Sushrut. When it is used as part of a ritual, the hearing of the bad word that is the nature of sin does not occur." The Brāhmaṇa also says, "The gods spoke together, O Brahman. Then that Brahman was heard on the Palasha. He is known by the name Sushrut." The gods spoke together on the Brahman, the Veda. Then that Brahman is heard on the Palasa. The meaning is that it is based on the Palasa tree. That is why the Palasa tree is known by the common name Sushrut. This is the purport of the Brāhmaṇa. O Sushrut, make yourself Sushrut. Sushrut itself is Sushrut, that Sushrut. Just as you, O Sushrut are the guardian of the treasure of the Veda of the gods who are disputing, and are the protector of the collection of treasures of the Vedas, in the same way may I be the guardian of the Brahman, the treasure of the Brāhmanas.
41.22	Thus the staff which has been prepared is given to the Brahmana student of the Veda at the end of the recitation of the Veda. The Ashvattha tree is the Vat tree. The Nyagrodha tree is the Banyan tree. The teacher gives the staff belonging to the Nyagrodha to the Vaishya student. Having made him recite the Veda according to the rules mentioned before, and having given him the staff, the teacher asks him to do what.
41.23-24	What is prescribed by Manu and others, and what is not prescribed, should be observed and avoided respectively. Thus, praise and blame should be known. What is blamed should be avoided, and what is praised should be accepted. Or, blaming others should be avoided, while praising others should be done at the right time, with the aim of benefiting others. Thus, knowledge and ignorance should be known for the purpose of elimination and acceptance. Faith is belief, and disbelief is lack of belief. Similarly, truth and falsehood. The nectar that causes immortality is the sanction of the union of knowledge and action. My vow should be known. Death, which causes death and is the cause of worldly existence, should also be known by one who seeks the ultimate goal of others. For one seeking heaven, it should be accepted. Hearing is hearing the Vedas and other subjects, and not hearing is hearing what is censured, such as the Lokāyata treatises. Vow is true vow, and false vow is what is meant by "what should be done". The vow of a brahmin in the Vedas for the purpose of studying, etc., should be known by me. The vow of Agni, along with Prajapatī, should be known and performed by me. The teacher is understood to be bestowing grace on all. The use of "sa" is Vedic. By this, one offers a fire-stick into the fire. The use of the word "imam" is a change of case. "I offer this fire-stick to Agni." "Abhi" means "directly". "O Agni, by your grace, may I become one who observes all vows." "Adhīte" and so on are for praising the teacher. Only he who knows the mantras and the Brahmanas is authorized to perform the Upanayana, not others. He who performs the Upanayana teaches them the well-known Vedas with their endless branches. One may study one, two, or three of them, or all of them, along with all their branches. The word "ha" is used in history. Therefore, the Upanayana is praised here, and not as a mere ritual. Some say that even those who are not capable of performing the Upanayana should do it. That is wrong, because the Smriti is inferred to have its root in the Veda. If it is argued that the injunction is not directly perceived there, then the same applies to the Arthavada.
41.25	The preceptor gives the Dakṣiṇā to the person who is being initiated. The father is the master of the student. In his absence, the elder brother and others.
41.26	He should not be made to sit down or to move around.
41.27	The vow of celibacy is mentioned in the beginning itself in the statement beginning with “One should be a follower of vows from the time of initiation onwards”. Hence it is not mentioned again. Thus the Upa nayana is concluded.
42.1	The three Vedas are the three sciences. The vow of the Trividyaka is the possession or purpose of that. We shall describe it. The one to whom it is being told, he is an unawakened student. The instruction is useless.
42.2	The meaning is that it should be practiced by the teacher.
42.3	At the beginning and end of study, one should offer three kindling sticks to the fire with the words "aho muche" (O, release me from sin). The meaning is that one should make the offering only with the words "svaha" and nothing else. Otherwise, one should say "I offer". The mantras "aho muche", "aho muche from sin" mean "release me from sin". They are repeated again: "If we have done any harm to the gods, O gods, we have done it. May Agni release me from all sins." "If we have committed sins by day or by night, O gods, may Vayu release me from all those sins." "If while awake or asleep, we have committed sins, O gods, Surya may release me from all of them." "The gods themselves are the gods." "O gods, O gods" is a repetition for emphasis. "If we have caused harm to the gods" means "if we have caused harm by disrespect". "May Agni release me from the sins we have committed against the gods, from all sins." The repetition of "aho muche, aho muche" is for emphasis. The word "aho" is used for excessive suffering. The second and third verses are self-explanatory. The two verses "by day and by night" include the two twilight periods.
42.4	The taking of the vow is the acceptance, and the giving up is the relinquishment. This has been stated in the Darsha-Pūrnamāsa. Thus the sūtra there is: Having washed the hands, standing to the right of the fire, one should say: "O Agni, lord of vows, O Vayu, lord of vows..." "O Agni, I have observed the vow. I tell you that. I am able to do that. By that, I have accomplished it." "O Vayu, lord..." "O Surya, lord..." "I have observed the vow for Agni, lord of the vow. I was not able to do that." "I tell you that. Please protect me from that." "O Vaya, lord..." "These six are explained in the Kṛcchravidhi. Here, in the taking and giving up of the vow, they should be done similarly." "There is this difference: In the relinquishment, one should throw the staff into the fire, the girdle into the water, and the garment until the completion of the oblation." "Then, the staff and others should be repeated with the mantras. Thus Manu says: 'Whatever skin is prescribed for him, whatever thread, whatever girdle, whatever staff, and whatever garment, all that is in them.' Thus the Trividyaka with the Apvarga is concluded. This is the forty-second chapter."
43.1-2	The mantras beginning with "cittiḥ sruga" are said to be the four Hotṛs. In them, the vow of Catuḥhotṛka should be undertaken according to the injunctions of the Brahma-faring life, as indicated by the Vedic section that teaches the duties of a Brahma-faring student.
43.3	The main rule is that one should undertake this vow for a year. The alternative rule is that one may undertake it for eight or four months.
43.4	Having killed the Darbha-staff in the eastern direction of Agni, and having seated another student of the Vedas in the southern direction of Agni, he should place four kindling-sticks in the fire with the four verses beginning with "Golden-coloured" and "Golden-coloured", etc., as before. The four verses beginning with "Golden-coloured" have been explained in the context of sweeping.
43.5	The vow which is to be taken by a Brahmachari is mentioned in the text. In this connection, the fourth Mantra is to be used, viz., "O Brahmanas, the lords of vows, I have taken the vow. I shall tell you about it. I am able to observe it." The first three Mantras are already explained. They are still to be used here, viz., "Agni, the lord of vows, Vayu, the lord of Vows, Surya, the lord ofVows".
43.6-8	The rest is to be said. Here there are seven mantras for the four Hotr priests. The part from "having offered" is clear. He mentally recites each mantra offered by the four Hotr priest. He should contemplate the source of the mantras. The meaning is "through the gateway of the mantras". He should recite, "May the vow prescribed in the Vedas be fulfilled here for me."
43.10	The termination of the vow is the final release.
44.0	Now the vow called Godāna is described, whose words Keśānta and Samāvartana are synonyms.
44.1-2	From the time of birth, when one reaches the age of sixteen, one should perform the rite called "Godaan" while being a Brahmachari. One who desires to take a wife quickly, after bathing beyond this age, is released from the duty of taking a wife. But one who wishes to marry after studying the Vedas for all time, should start with Upanayana and perform Godaan at the age of sixteen. There is a view that one should practice celibacy for forty-eight years after studying the three Vedas. When one studies only one Veda, it becomes sixteen years. If one's Upanayana happens at the age of 16 due to some calamity, then the Godaan rite is completed in the fire, meaning the completion of study. Even one who studies only a part of the Veda and then dies, this view applies to him. The Godaan rite, which is a variant of Keshantaka, is explained here as Sikhakarman. Here also, everything is the same up to the Kshurakarman rite, which is the conclusion.
44.3	Having performed the rite of purification, he bathes in the fire and then sits facing east on darbha grass. The Brahmachari is sprinkled with water with the two verses, "Those waters that have become mixed with milk, those that are in the sky and those on earth, I sprinkle you with the radiance of all those waters, with their splendor." The meter is Prastara Pankti, the verse is for the attainment of immortality, and the Anushtubh is for the king. O Brahmachari, I sprinkle you, the king, with the radiance and vigor of all those waters. With what kind of radiance? With the radiance that exists together with gold. Of which waters? Those that are in heaven, present in the sun, as stated in the scripture, "Rain is born from the sun." And those that are in space, present in the sky, meaning in the clouds. And those that are on earth, present on earth, in rivers and so on, and those that have become mixed together with milk, meaning they have become mixed with all the oblations in Agnihotra and other offerings. The sprinkling is done with the verse, "I sprinkle you, I sprinkle you." The meaning is, "May you become radiant and wealthy, and may you be a performer of sacrifices." As you are the one who increases friends, the one who makes friends flourish, may Savita make you so. The Let suffix is used in the sense of the Ling affix.
44.4	In the same way, the king should be anointed. Since the entire pair of mantras is employed, it is transferred to that. By the Anuvaka beginning with "O god, you are the first, the father, the protector, the shield for him", one should do other things as mentioned, such as armoring and so on. Is everything done? No, it is said. "Except for what is not in the sacrifice", where sacrifice is the Soma sacrifice, and what is not in it is the effort made by giving up wealth and so on. By the direction of the Anuvaka and by that indication, even these are prohibited.
45.1	After the completion of the vow, the Veda-student should be married after bathing. The rites of cooking are prescribed for one who has been married. They are performed in the fire. For one whose father is alive, there is an option in the marriage fire. If one whose father is still alive does not maintain it, then he must produce it internally. The acquisition of another fire after the father's death is preceded by the cessation of the ancestral fire. He says that the cessation is when the father is dead, only one companion remains, the ancestral fire. The rite of unification of that single fire should be performed by the son alone, not by the family priest and others. Another explanation is that one who has only the ancestral fire and not the marriage fire himself, being in the house of the single fire, when the father dies, the word "unification" means both the abandonment of the previous fire and the bringing of the fire from the house. Because it is the proper installation and cleaning. Due to the multi-purpose nature of verbal roots and affixes, he says this to clarify it.
45.2	The supreme lord, the father, has said that when the fire is extinguished, it should be rekindled by the son. This is the meaning of the statement.
45.3	All the priests and relatives should be seated near the fire.
45.4	The time of dawn is the time when the dawn has passed and the sun is about to rise. One should light the fire that has been set aside for the day, until the sun rises. The meaning is that one should light the fire until the sun rises.
45.5	The fire should be extinguished with a mixture of water and powdered beans, placed in an udumbara or bell-metal vessel. The verses of the Viraṭ-pankti are the Brāhmaṇas. The meaning of the Rg verses is: We invoke, we offer oblations to the gods. Whom do we invoke? Savitar, the one with golden hands, and also Vayu, Indra, Prajapati, and the Angirasas. For what purpose? May the fire-eater be extinguished.
45.6	The ashes of the fire which has been extinguished should be placed on a bundle of grass made of the special grass of the Kāsas. The fire which devours flesh should be sent away with the Tristubh metre. The reading may also be "the bundle of grass made by the Kāsas". There, the bundle of grass is made of grass whose roots and tips are not properly joined. The meaning of the verse is that the fire which devours raw flesh is sent away from the sacrificer, and is thrown far away to the king of Yama, who is the carrier of the heap of sins of enemies. The other fire should go far away with that fire. I will bring back Yama. This fire should carry oblations to the gods here itself. What kind of fire? One who knows, one who has attained wealth, or one who has attained knowledge. Even one who has not performed marriage rites, they desire to adopt another fire in the form of Prajapati.
45.7	In the south-west direction, at the intersection of the south and west directions, having placed the ashes in a pot, which were burnt with the mantra "nirdaghtham" (burnt), and the head of the deceased father, which was supported by a wooden frame called "upadhana".
45.8	The Upasthāna is to be done with four Mantras beginning with "Apasmadetu". "Apasmadetu", "Nirrti", "Naha syā", "Agotām", "Nāṣṭrām", "Pāpman", "Sarvam tad apāhaṃ", "Apasyai Nṛtān", "Pāśān", "Mṛtyoḥ ekashatam ca ye", "Apasyāye sināḥ pāśān", "Ekashatam suve", "Ekashat sinā naddhāḥ", "Tān pāśān apasy aham", "Suve", "Iśe", "Karīṣu samartha bhavāmīti" arthaḥ. "Ye te pāśā ekashatam mṛtyo mṛtyāyahantave", "Tān te yajñasya māyayā sarvān avayajāmahe". "He Mṛtyo ye te pāśā ekaśatam mṛtyāya hantive hananāya, tān te sambandhinān sarvān avayaṃsmahe yajñakarmaṇā apanayāmahe yajñasya mārgeṇa yajñakarmāṇi kṛtvā, yajñakāryāṇi kārīṣyāmahe iti". "Devīm aham Nṛtīm badhāmānam pitā iva putram damāmi vacobhiḥ". "Yā jāyamanasya jāyamanas-syasya śiraḥ devī prati sūriḥ vicchate". "Yasminn asti jantur jāyate tasya sarvasya devī Nṛtī śiraḥ prati vicchate pratikūlam paśyati". "Aham etāṃ devīṃ Nṛtīm damāmi anuśāmi vacobhir vedikamantraiḥ apasarāmi akāryāt". "Pitā iva putram badhāmānas tam damāmi vacorbhiḥ".  Translation: The Upasthana is to be done by four mantras beginning with "Apa-smadetu". Apa-smade-tu, Nirrti, Naha sya, Agotām, Nas-tram, Papman, Sarvam tad apā-haṃ, Apasyai Nṛ-tān, Pāśān, Mṛtyoḥ eka-shatam ca ye, Apasyāye sinäḥ pāśān, Ekashatam suve, Ekashat sinä naddhāḥ, Tān pāśān apa-sy aham, Suve, Iśe, Karīṣu samar-tha bhavāmiti arthaḥ. "Ye te pāśaḥ ekashatam mṛtyo-mṛtyāy-ahantave", Tān te yajnasya māyayā-sarvān avayajāmahe. "He Mrt-yo ye te pāśa eka-shata mṛtyā-yahantave hananāya tān te samban-dhinān sarvām apanayā-mahe yajñamārgeṇa yajnā-rthāni karīṣyāma iti". "De-vīm aham Nrtīm badhāmānaṃ pitā iva putraṃ damāmi vacorhiḥ". Yā jāyamananasyā-jāyamananasyasya śira-ḥ devī prati sūrī vicchate. Yasminn asti jan-tur jāyate tas-yas sarvasya devīnṛtī śiras-prati vicchate pratikaulam paśyati. Aham etā-ṃ devīm nṛtīm damāmī anuśāmi vaco-bhi-rvedikamantrai-rapasarāmi akārāt. Pitā iva putra-ṃ badhāmā-nas tam damā-mi vacorbhi-rvedika-mantrai-rapasarāmī akārāt.
45.9	Then the Vetasa branch and the bundle of reeds should be placed in the same place where the lead ash is kept.
45.10	O ye, take up the boat, the bull, the raft, may it carry you across all evil. Climb ye on to the golden boat of Savitar, with its six waves. May we cross the sea of worldly existence, O ye, the sons of Bandhu. Take up the raft, the bull, which is the means of crossing the sea of worldly life. Go to the attainment in the form of following it. The meaning is that ye may touch it. And that bull may carry you across all evils, all sins. May it carry you across without any remainder. May it carry away. May it remove. Climb ye on the boat belonging to Savitar, the knowledge of truth. Savitar is the sun, the Prajapati, the illuminator of all activities. The boat is the golden, the stainless, the boat not agitated by ignorance. From which we may cross the sea of the world, the sea of worldly experience, with its six agitated waves, and attain immortality, the state of the supreme Brahman. The meaning is, may we reach the other shore of the ocean of worldly existence. The six waves are passion, hatred, pleasure, pain, delusion and intoxication. Or the six senses mentioned by Kanada. Or the six waves are the objects of sense, such as form, taste, smell, touch, sound, pleasure, etc. The six waves, along with the mind, are ignorance, smiling, passion, hatred, attachment and pride.
45.11	Those who have returned to their homes and those who are in the house, they sprinkle them with the uninjured smoke of barley and other seeds. Those who have come with the ashes, they themselves sprinkle. Having sprinkled, taking the fire in the hand, with the prescribed cow, they go around the fire three times, as it is on the ground, in the direction of the fire, reciting the verse beginning with "We have gone around the cow," "We have gone round the cow, we have gone around the fire, we have made the food among the gods, who can overcome these?" We have gone around the cows, we have gone round the fire, we went around the fire, We have made the food, the oblation, among the gods, Who can overcome these? He is able to conquer.
45.12	Having placed a stone, gold, or all seeds in a vessel filled with water, they touch the stone and others with their own hands, saying, "The stone is flowing." With the Tristubh meter, "This stone is flowing." "Lee" means touching. The stone is connected with water, therefore, O friends, relatives, and others, rise up, be enthusiastic, be energetic, perform the rites of Japa, Homa, and Yaga, having purified your bodies by touching water. Here, we abandon those who are absent, those who are not present, we abandon them. May we go beyond the obstacles, the obstacles, the ones facing us, the ones facing the path. We may go beyond, may we go, may we attain, because of the auspiciousness.
46.1	The meaning is that when the Brahmanas and others are purified from their impurity due to the death of Parameṣṭhin, the Śrāddha should be performed for him and the fire should be kindled. Though the Śrāddha for Parameṣṭhin is prescribed in the monthly Śrāddha, etc., yet the Śrāddha on the new moon day, etc., is not prescribed for many persons. It should be performed in the same fire, because there is no abandonment of that fire. The plural number in the words “to the Pitṛs” indicates this intention. All the rites like Pākayajña, etc., are mentioned. Even one who is not married should kindle the fire for the purpose of performing Śrāddhas, etc. Then he should marry for the sake of accomplishing what is necessary. Thus, the rites like seeing the sun, etc., are established. But generally, those who live in Āryāvarta and have no marriage, and whose fathers, etc., are dead, perform the first Śrāddhas in the worldly fire, and then marry after the Sapandīkaraṇa rite. They look for haste in taking possession of the fire. Even there, the good do not show disrespect. Having said that the Śrāddha is to be performed in the fire, he says the kindling of the fire for the Upaṣṭambha rite.
46.2	The food eaten by the person observing the fast is called aupavastha. It is eaten after taking fire from the ordinary fire, after excluding the food of meat, vegetables, salt, etc., and after eating only such things as vrīhi, barley, milk, ghee, etc. He eats it with a companion. The food eaten on the tenth day is called aupavastra. On the eleventh day, there is śrāddha. On the eleventh, if one observes the fast, then on the twelfth day, there will be śrāddha. One should keep awake. The meaning is that one should protect it till night. One should also lie down near it, along with the priests and relatives. The word "and" indicates that the sprinkling of the Garhapatya pit, the sprinkling of the earth with the sprinkling of the sprinkling of the sprinkled earth, and the mixing of the earth with cow dung, sand, and cow dung, is also included.
46.3	When the fire is almost extinguished, when the light is dim, then one should take out the ashes from the fire-room, which resembles the Garhapatya pit.
46.4	Having placed the earth-materials, beginning with sand and ending with gravel, in a pit, and having thrown them in, with the first of the seven verses recited, namely, "From the ocean" (RV 10.190.1), which is the first of the verses.
46.5	Here, though there is no difference, the last one is taken from the mantra syllable, such as 'What is not nectar on earth', etc., and the last one is 'This was the highest', etc. Others say this.
46.6	The meaning is that the Garhapatya is produced in the other half of the pit, as it was produced before. The meaning is that it is produced by the mantras and the rites of procedure. Just as the Garhapaty is produced by the two kindling woods of Ficus Religiosa and the embryo of the Acacia Catechu, by the special mantras and other rites, so also this domestic fire, the Avasathya, is produced by the Upapada rites.
46.7	Having held the fire produced by churning the fire-wood, which is of the size of the knee, and which is well-kindled, he places it on the ground, on the earth, and in the heaven. The placing of the fire is done by reciting the Aṅgiras-sūtra, "May the Gārhapatya be auspicious." The meaning is that he places it by reciting this. Having held it by lowering it to the height of the knee, he places it. This much is meant.
46.8	The twigs of the golden-leaved trees, each separately, having been brought, the barks of the trees such as Udumbara, Ashvattha, Sami, and Palasa, having been cut, the twigs are placed on them. The mantra is "O Agni, you are the one who is born from the golden-leaved tree."
46.9	Having collected, having sprinkled, having spread, having offered one ladleful of ghee with the verse, "Seven are thine, O Agni," and the second with cooked rice and other things with the verse, “Svāhā to Prajāpati,” one should offer two oblations. Here the oblation is equal to the ladle. The offering of two oblations is done with four spoonfuls of meat. Here it is connected with the Agniyeka.
46.10	The mantras to be used at the time of laying the fire are now described. The mantras are to be used in accordance with the context. The mantras to he used at the time when the fire is laid down are to be used as they are found in the context. The following mantras are to he used at that time. "O Agni, thou art the best of all, the most excellent, the most brilliant, the most shining, the most glorious, the most auspicious, the most auspicious of all. Thou art the best of the gods, the most excellent of the gods, thou art the most auspicious of the gods, O Agni." "O Agni, the best of all the gods, the best of the deities, the most auspicious among the gods, O god, thou art the bestower of wealth." "O Agni the best of all gods, the most auspicious and the most excellent of all gods, O god thou art the besTower of wealth." "Thou art the best of gods, the most brilliant of gods, the best among gods, the most shining of gods, the bestower of riches." "O Agni thou art the best among gods the most auspicious of gods, the bestower of wealth." "The best of gods, O Agni, the most auspicious one, the bestower or wealth." "O god, thou art best of gods, most auspicious of gods." "O Agni best of gods, bestower of wealth, most auspicious of all gods." "O god thou art the best, the most auspicious." "O Agni most auspicious of gods the bestower of all wealth." "O best of gods, thou art most auspicious, the bestower ot wealth." "O most auspicious of gods thou art the bestover of wealth." "Of thy auspicious forms, O Jātavedas, which are in the sky, on earth and in heaven, do thou, O Agni, come hither with thy retinue, with thy friends, with thy golden womb, and carry the oblation."

1.1.2	The same is the injunction of creation etc. because of the difference. Or, it is the same that is the authority of the Veda. Why then is its non-perception stated? It is said, 'Because of the release of Brahmanas'. Indeed, just as the injunctions of the beginningless Vedas are understood, so is the injunction understood here. The meaning is not stated by the collection. The injunction and the promised are mentioned. The word 'sa' has the sense of subsequent connection. And the cessation of authority from the word 'sa'. The authority of the Veda is the only injunction. The understanding of the injunctions of injunctions as the remainder of the injunctions is the meaning. Therefore, the nature of substance, quality, action, result, and cause is known from the world. Indeed, the Veda is created because of its nature as sound, like the conquest of the earth. And the creator of that is unknown. What is known? And that is perceived by other means. Indeed, the nature as sound proves as much as the creation. And the Cupid, who is in the womb of Hiranyagarbha, proves the entire bondage. And there is also other perception and inference here. The creator of the Veda is not the Lord etc., because of being the creator, like substance and person. Therefore, the example is not related to what is to be proved. He states the meaning of the word 'Amana' (Veda).
1.1.3	And because of constant practice, the Veda is mentioned again. The word 'mantras' means those which end with the settled (meaning). The Brahmanas are those beginning with 'Brahma indeed was here first'. The plural form is used because the mantras are many and are used in rituals. The Brahmanas are mentioned in the plural because they are many and are meant for the purpose of the mantras. The words 'What is in the cloud', 'Virat indeed is this', 'Brahma indeed is this' are mentioned for the sake of general understanding. The injunction of rites is from the mantras and Brahmanas. The injunction of other rites is from the signs and the special rules. The word 'again' is as before. The word 'mantrāḥ' is used in the plural because it refers to the mantras of the Kalpaja branches. The word 'twice' and the word 'Aamnaya' are used to indicate both mantras and Brahmana. The word 'Aamnayika' indicates the injunction of the meaning.
1.1.4	Here, in this scripture, just as the Brāhmaṇa prescribes, so also the mantras prescribing the rites prescribe. But why is it not the case that the mantras alone are the prescribers? The Brāhmaṇa alone is said to be the prescriber, because the Brāhmaṇas are more abundant in prescribing. Therefore, the Brāhmaņas are the prescribers. The injunction of the meaning understood in that way is the prescriber. For example, "One desiring heaven should offer Agnihotra." "I pour out what is pleasing to Agni, in the impulse of the divine Savitā, with the arms of the Ashvins, with the hands of Pūṣan." "I sprinkle what is pleasing to you, O Agni." "In the impulse of the Divine Savitā." The mantra for spreading the fire is an example. If the mantras are the prescribers, like the Brāhmaņa texts, then the meaning of these mantras is accomplished by understanding the rites. The purpose is stated by the statement of application. The purpose is inferred by the statement of the application, and the sequence of injunctions is imagined. But in this way, "They crossed over that river, the first ones." "Having milked as stated, one should pour it." The purpose of such statements as "One performs the water for peace for the deceased, for those who have been designated," etc., should be stated. The mantras are for the purpose of application.
1.1.5	As the Brāhmaṇas have a different meaning, so also the Mantras have a different meaning. The statement of the different meaning of the Mantras is generally the statement of praise, censure and benediction. Out of fear of the heaviness of the text, the statement of the difference is not made. The statement of an example is made. The statements of the Mantras are like this.
1.1.6	Those mantras which have the Brahmana as their authority are called Brahmana-type. But in the example, 'Unpleasant is the enemy', the Brahmana-type is not found. The meaning is that the Brahmana is a statement of meaning. The Brahmana-type refers to the knowledge of the meaning of the words 'He who knows thus'. The Brahmana says, 'These verses praise'. And it is said, 'I saw the cowherd', 'The eye is in front', 'That was here'. This is a statement of the manner. The Brahmana is Brahmana-type because of the Brahmana-authority. The Brahmanas 'Virat is indeed', 'He who knows', 'The Vratika was' are similar because of the similarity of meaning and because of the recitation in the middle of the mantras. The application is like that. The mantras 'To that eastern direction' are prescribed in the Nakṣatrakalpa. Then where the cows are afflicted, there are rites. It is said, 'From where were they born? Which one is that?' Is there a rule for the arising of this or not? It is said, ‘From where were they? By whom was the heel? In which limb? He who is the past and the future. The celibate. In the leftovers. The anger.' The others are related to other sections. Therefore, the connection with the Self and the Deity is known. And because of the connection with all rites without distinction, there is the connection with all the rites. The collection is connected with the rule. Therefore, the taking of the mantras is for the purpose of application. The means of knowledge has been stated. In Dharma, the means of knowledge is also scriptural and smrti. Here, this is stated for that purpose.
1.1.7	In the absence of that scripture, the right giving is untouched by passion etc. The Smṛtis of Manu etc. are also the authority in the relation of injunction. Know that from the fact of being released. Because the authority of that is released by the learners. The meaning is that it has disappeared. And in the absence of that, Smṛti does not say what is expected in the face of many contradictions. Or, the absence of that is the authority of the self-instruction in the absence of the direct heard and the inferential. From what? From the fact of being liberated. Because of being related to liberation.

Therefore, the taking of the mantras is for the purpose of application. The means of knowledge has been stated. In Dharma, the means of knowledge is also scriptural and smrti. Here, this is stated for that purpose.
1.1.8-9	The meaning is that of the learned. "It is established that Dharma has its root in the Veda and Smrti. Now this injunction is stated as a supplement." We shall state for the purpose of sacrifice, because of its being non-worldly, for the purpose of the promise of Darsha etc. And hence these definitions are for all purposes.

1.1.10	The sixth case is for the purpose of the fourth case. The word "pitṛ" is used in the sense of the deity because it is the deity that is benefited by the word. Sacrifice is giving, because of the recollection of the word. That giving is to the gods and the ancestors. The word "gods" and "ancestors" are used together, and it is said to be a sacrifice of union. This is the only exception. Therefore, it is said in the context of "samavartaniya" and "samapanīya" that the word "gods" is the purpose. In the context of "piṇḍapitṛyajña", here one offers oblations to Agni Kavya-vāhana and Svadhā to the ancestors. Here the word "ancestors" is used in a collective sense. The sixth case is also for the purpose of giving. The giving of wealth to the gods and ancestors is called sacrifice.
1.1.11	The person who is wearing the Yajñopavīta should recite the Mantras in a low voice. Here, the direction is not mentioned because the option of directions is mentioned later.
1.1.12	The person who is wearing Yajñopavītta should perform the rites. Though it is well-known from Smṛti, it is mentioned here because of the mention of the cow and other animals. But if one does not wear it, it is for the purpose of expiation.

1.1.13	The person who wears the sacred thread in the manner of the ancient sages is called the Pitryupavitī. The statement has a purpose.
1.1.14	The word "or" is used to indicate the option of facing east or north. In reality, one should face east, as stated in the Veda, "One who is not facing east" and also "The eastern offering is combined with the eastern offerings."
1.1.15	The performer of the rites for the ancestors faces south.
1.1.11	The person who is wearing the Yajñopavīta should recite the Mantras in a low voice. Here, the direction is not mentioned because the option of directions is mentioned later.

1.1.16	In the eastern direction, the rite of the gods is to be completed, or in the northern direction, because it is stated that the rite and the dharma belong to the performer. And there is no mutual understanding between the two words, as it would lead to an extreme purpose. And in the Ajyatantratantra, it is said, "Installing in the east and north." Each of these is connected with the finality. This is its completion. It is said: digging, sprinkling, filling the northern side, taking possession, spreading, making it square, covering, consecrating, etc.
1.1.17	The conclusion is the finality. The beginning is for the purpose of preventing the cessation of the control of the gods.

Because the word "karma" is used, it means "the act of the ancestors is done once".
1.1.23	The offering to the gods should be made with the utterance of the word "svāhā". And the gift should be given with the utterance of "vaṣaṭkāra". "Svāhākāra-prādanā" is a bahuvrīhi compound. "Vaṣaṭkārapradānā" is a Bahuvrīhi compound also. The utterance of "vaṭaṭkāra" is for the purpose of option. There is a combination with the Rk. There is no difference between these two because of the difference in the purpose. The Svaras are as per the scriptures. Because of the statement "with svāhā at the end", there is no presence of the Rk in the middle. Therefore, it is given.
1.1.21	The right hand is to be held in front of oneself in the performance of the rites of the gods, such as the taking up of the Veda, etc.
1.1.22	The performance of rites with the left hand turned away is to be done as in the case of the Agnipariniya rite.

1.1.25	Darbha grass should be cut near the roots and used in the rites for the Pitṛs. In the case of offering salt, there is a reversal between the gods and the Pitṛs; the procedure for the gods is for the purpose of connecting with the gods. Otherwise, the Pitṛs would have authority.
1.1.26	The grass cut at the knots is to be used in the rites of the gods.
1.1.27	The performer, using the mantra "pra" (to take), gives the well-known grass-cutting instrument, which is cut at the knots, because it is suitable for collecting grass. Although it is like fire, still the sprinkling mantra is for the sake of the sacrificer, because it is heard in the benediction. The sprinkling substances are as they are.

1.1.28	Having loosened the knots of the grass with the remaining Rk, he brings the grass silently and places it on the northern side of the fire silently. The statement "silently" is because of the indication of the bringing. Let the first handful not be separate and barren. Then the grass for covering the altar is loosened, then the grass for eating around is loosened. The repetition of the mantra is for all, because it is required for the consecration of the mantras and because it is a special thing being taken. In the Ajyatantrās, there is no handful because of the absence of application.
1.1.24	All that was said in the previous Sūtra should be repeated here. The example is: "Om, salutations to Agni, the carrier of oblations, to the Pitṛs, the ancestors."

1.1.29	When one returns after having reached the fire, the performer, Brahma, the sacrificer, or the wife, should not turn back with his body. This is the order of the elements for the purpose of returning.

But in the case of causing the smoke to rise, there is the understanding of the covering.
1.1.30	One should not touch the sacrificial implements, such as the ladle, with the left hand.
1.1.28	Having loosened the knots of the grass with the remaining Rk, he brings the grass silently and places it on the northern side of the fire silently.

1.1.31	Having placed the right knee on the ground, one should offer. In the case of the oblique arm, the offering is made with emphasis. The offering is made in the case of the two offering-makers, because of the use of the word 'juhoti' in the statement 'One offers each successive one together'. "The two kinds of authority have been declared, and the common property has been stated, and the prohibition of the attainment of the meaning has been stated, because of being a part of the injunction, the remaining is stated."

1.1.32	The full-moon day of the previous month is the full-moon day, and the fifteenth day is the new-moon day. The former is the principal, because there is no contradiction. The two full-moon days are mentioned by different injunctions. The full-moon of the latter month is the first day, because of its connection with the latter, and because there is no transaction. The name is meaningless because of the absence of transaction. The meaningfulness is due to its being the cause of action. The time is always meant for the purpose of that action. The action of accepting the vow, etc., is permitted because of the injunction "One gives oblations to the gods from the latter". And because of the injunction in this way, it is meant for the purpose conveying the knowledge of a particular time. The acceptance is done on the full-moon of previous month, and the giving is done on the latter. This is said to be the supreme. If the full-moon were at midday in the latter part of that day, then the acceptance would not be known as the well-known one. It is said that the acceptance should be done on the former full-moon day so that it does not differ from the Kausikas. And there is doubt about the determination of the Upvasatha day, because of the statement "Today is Upvasatha". The acceptance is meant for conveying the knowledge of the purpose of the sacrifice. The offering of food is accepted as the vow, and the offering of the principal oblation is accepted as the offering of the oblation.
1.1.33	The meaning of this is the same as that of the preceding Sūtra. The full-moon day is the most distant from the sun and the moon, the new-moon day is just the opposite. The day on which the moon is not visible is called Sinīvālī, and on that day the word “Vālas” is used. Therefore, the Piṇḍapitṛyajña is performed on the new-moon. And since the Śrāddha is a part of the Piṇḍa-offering, it is also performed on the new moon. The offering of food is made for the purpose of giving, and the connection of the two is due to their having the same purpose, because the performance of the sacrifice on the new- moon and the performance of the Piṇda-offering on the new-moom are both possible.
1.1.34	The householder, having ascertained that the day of fasting is suitable on the fourteenth day of the bright fortnight, eats the food of fasting. The food of fasting is the food of one who is fasting.
1.1.32	The full-moon day of the previous month is the full-moon day, and the fifteenth day is the new-moon day. The former is the principal, because there is no contradiction. The two full-moon days are mentioned by different injunctions. The full-moon of the latter month is the first day, because of its connection with the latter, and because there is no transaction.

The offering of food is made for the purpose of giving, and the connection of the two is due to their having the same purpose, because the performance of the sacrifice on the new- moon and the performance of the Piṇda-offering on the new-moom are both possible.
1.1.34	The householder, having ascertained that the day of fasting is suitable on the fourteenth day of the bright fortnight, eats the food of fasting. The food of fasting is the food of one who is fasting.
1.1.35	Honey, honey-like, and honey-wine are prohibited. Salt is of all kinds. Meat is nourishing. Even one who desires nourishment should eat the Idā-oblation, etc., which are prescribed in the scriptures. But all this is not to be eaten, because of the possibility of total loss. He should avoid beans and other things on the day of fasting, and also wine, etc., which is always prohibited. Therefore, they are not to be prohibited here. Fasting is the day of fasting. What one eats, that is eaten by him. Because of the mention of eating. The statement "today is the day of fast" is not determined. Why? Because of the relation of the former and the latter parts. Because of the relation with the sacrifice in the former and the later new moon days, and in the battle and the assembly, and because of the action in the morning, not in the latter part. Because of the non-obstruction of the action in today's day of fasting, the action in the battle and assembly, the action in today is determined. The day of fasting in the latter part should be understood as not to be fasted. Because of the meaning of the action of fasting, it is for the purpose of eating. Therefore, because of the absence of the action of fast in the present day, such as the Aghamarṣaṇa, etc., there is no action. The statement "one who is fasting should eat" is for the purpose. Because of the statement of eating in the afternoon.
1.1.36	The Agnihotra is performed with one verse, because of the rule. The offering of the Samidhs is done by the rule. The mention of Samidhs is because of the rule, and because of the statement of the sacrificer. In the Agnihotra, there is a vision of Agni and Soma, and there is no vision of Indra and Agni. This is stated in the text. The mention of the rule is because of the statement, "O Agni, mine"
1.1.37	Since there is no action in the order of this optional rite, it should be said that one takes up the vow by placing the kindling woods with the verse, "O Agni, may my radiance be in the vow. You are the lord of vows." Thus, when it is said like this, both the optional and obligatory rites would be applicable. And then the statement would be appropriate. And here, the word svāhā is not for the purpose of the previous offering, because it is taken from the vow. What is the vow again?
1.1.35	Honey, honey-like, and honey-wine are prohibited. Salt is of all kinds. Meat is nourishing. Even one who desires nourishment should eat the Idā-oblation, etc., which are prescribed in the scriptures. But all this is not to be eaten, because of the possibility of total loss. He should avoid beans and other things on the day of fasting, and also wine, etc., which is always prohibited. Therefore, they are not to be prohibited here. Fasting is the day of fasting. What one eats, that is eaten by him. Because of the mention of eating. The statement "today is the day of fast" is not determined. Why? Because of the relation of the former and the latter parts. Because of the relation with the sacrifice in the former and the later new moon days, and in the battle and the assembly, and because of the action in the morning, not in the latter part. Because of the non-obstruction of the action in today's day of fasting, the action in the battle and assembly, the action in today is determined. The day of fasting in the latter part should be understood as not to be fasted. Because of the meaning of the action of fasting, it is for the purpose of eating. Therefore, because of the absence of the action of fast in the present day, such as the Aghamarṣaṇa, etc., there is no action. The statement "one who is fasting should eat" is for the purpose. Because of the statement of eating in the afternoon.
1.1.38	The rest is to be supplied. The prohibition of sexual intercourse is implied by the words “one who is a student” and “one who is observing a vow”.
1.1.39	On the ground which is not covered, one should sleep on the bed of Darbha grass, etc., on the first day of the month.
1.1.36	The Agnihotra is performed with one verse, because of the rule. The offering of the Samidhs is done by the rule. The mention of Samidhs is because of the rule, and because of the statement of the sacrificer. In the Agnihotra, there is a vision of Agni and Soma, and there is no vision of Indra and Agni. This is stated in the text. The mention of the rule is because of the statement, "O Agni, mine"
1.1.37	Since there is no action in the order of this optional rite, it should be said that one takes up the vow by placing the kindling woods with the verse, "O Agni, may my radiance be in the vow. You are the lord of vows." Thus, when it is said like this, both the optional and obligatory rites would be applicable. And then the statement would be appropriate. And here, the word svāhā is not for the purpose of the previous offering, because it is taken from the vow. What is the vow again?
1.1.38	The rest is to be supplied. The prohibition of sexual intercourse is implied by the words “one who is a student” and “one who is observing a vow”.
1.1.39	On the ground which is not covered, one should sleep on the bed of Darbha grass, etc., on the first day of the month.
1.1.40	Having offered the morning oblation, one should not offer the evening oblation. One should begin the evening oblation only after the morning oblation. Then the performer should wash his hands with water, saying, "For you, O Agni, for you, O Agni." Then, taking the sacrificial grass for eating, and placing it behind the fire, he spreads it. On top of that, he spreads a red-colored skin, with the hair pointing upwards, and makes two purifiers. Having offered the fire, the performer washes his hands with the three mantras, saying, "I wash my hands." Since it is said, "One should apply the mantras as appropriate," the verses of other schools are not used, due to the possibility of excess. The word "having washed" is for the purpose of indicating the same agent as in the pouring down. Therefore, in the ghee ritual, the washing of the hands is not done. The word "in them" indicates the subsequent establishment. In order to establish the subsequent state of the sacrificial grass on the skin of other offerings, it is said, "After the fire, the consecration of the offerings on the skin" is for the purpose indicating the sequence of the purifier ritual. Just as the sequence of the rite of water for peace is in the Aghayana, so here is the sequence of the ritual of ghee. Therefore, the sequence of the ghee ritual indicates the sequence of the purifying ritual and the rites on the altar. Since it is said "The oblation is not purified," the purifying ritual is washing, because of the word "consecration."
1.1.41	The grass used for eating is to be removed, and the grass with uncut tips is to be taken and washed. This is the ritual of purification. Then comes the wiping with a mantra. The term "apāvītara" means "one who has been purified". Those who know the great meaning of the Vedas, the great-grandson of Vatsasharman, Bhatta Darida, has composed the commentary on the Kausika Sutra. The first chapter is completed.

Therefore, the sequence of the ghee ritual indicates the sequence of the purifying ritual and the rites on the altar. Since it is said "The oblation is not purified," the purifying ritual is washing, because of the word "consecration."
1.2.1	Having placed the barley grains between the purified skin and the earth, he offers the oblation on the skin, with the mantra "For the god thee" By the mention of the mantra, the action is understood. The offering is done with the mantra. If there were no mention of the mantra in the explicit injunction, the action would not be possible. Therefore, even though the action is established by the mantra, the mention of the offering is repeated. With the right hand, he silently makes three handfuls and the fourth. In the case of the oblations to be offered in the ash, there may be a doubt about the specific mention. We shall explain the specific mention. There are four kinds of oblations to be cooked in a pot - those with explicit mention, those without explicit mention, those with explicit and implicit mention, and those to be offered in ash. Examples are - "One offers to Indra with a cake", "One should perform the Samavartaniya and Samapaṇīya sacrifices", "One offers to the one who has established the fire, with the mantra 'This is that which is in your mind'", "One eats after returning". These are the examples.
1.1.41	The grass used for eating is to be removed, and the grass with uncut tips is to be taken and washed. This is the ritual of purification. Then comes the wiping with a mantra. The term "apāvītara" means "one who has been purified". Those who know the great meaning of the Vedas, the great-grandson of Vatsasharman, Bhatta Darida, has composed the commentary on the Kausika Sutra. The first chapter is completed.
1.2.2	The mantra for the offering of oblations is "to Agni and Soma". The oblation to Agni and Soma is offered. Thus, it is understood that the offering is made to Agni and Soma. When the meaning is understood in this way, the specific statement "to Agni and to Soma" is made in place of "to Agni".
1.2.3	Thus, even in the case of the New Moon sacrifice, where the injunction is not explicit, the offering of the Pavitra and other things should be done. But there is a difference in the case of this sacrifice. The offering is made to Indra and Agni, and the New Moon sacrifice is mentioned. This mention of the New Moon is purposeless, because the relation with Indra and Agni is already established. It is not purposeless, because it is necessary to mention the New Moon sacrifice in the context of the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice. The mention of the New moon is necessary to exclude the Agniṣṭōma sacrifice. The Agniṣṭoṃma sacrifice is always performed before the New Moon sacrifice. The mention is necessary to exclude this sacrifice. The Agnișṭōma is always performed before, because it is mentioned first. Therefore, there is an option between the Agniṣṭom and the New Moon sacrifices.
1.2.1	Having placed the barley grains between the purified skin and the earth, he offers the oblation on the skin, with the mantra "For the god thee" By the mention of the mantra, the action is understood. The offering is done with the mantra. If there were no mention of the mantra in the explicit injunction, the action would not be possible. Therefore, even though the action is established by the mantra, the mention of the offering is repeated. With the right hand, he silently makes three handfuls and the fourth.

These are the examples.
1.2.4	And the Agniya rite should always be performed first. When the rice is being divided after the Avahanana, those that are divided first are the Agniya. After the Avahanana the Agniya is performed first, not in vain.
1.2.2	The mantra for the offering of oblations is "to Agni and Soma". The oblation to Agni and Soma is offered. Thus, it is understood that the offering is made to Agni and Soma. When the meaning is understood in this way, the specific statement "to Agni and to Soma" is made in place of "to Agni".
1.2.5	He sprinkles the rice-grains placed on the skin with the Pavitra-water, saying, "I sprinkle thee for Agni, for thy liking." "I sprinkle thee, for Agni and Soma, for thy liking," is the example. In cases of indistinct injunctions, the sprinkling is done without any mantra, as in the case of the offering of the rice-grains. The sprinkling is done according to the rules laid down in the Nirvapa-mantra, just as the washing of the hands is done according to rules laid down in a mantra.
1.2.3	Thus, even in the case of the New Moon sacrifice, where the injunction is not explicit, the offering of the Pavitra and other things should be done. But there is a difference in the case of this sacrifice. The offering is made to Indra and Agni, and the New Moon sacrifice is mentioned. This mention of the New Moon is purposeless, because the relation with Indra and Agni is already established. It is not purposeless, because it is necessary to mention the New Moon sacrifice in the context of the Agniṣṭoma sacrifice. The mention of the New moon is necessary to exclude the Agniṣṭōma sacrifice. The Agniṣṭoṃma sacrifice is always performed before the New Moon sacrifice. The mention is necessary to exclude this sacrifice. The Agnișṭōma is always performed before, because it is mentioned first. Therefore, there is an option between the Agniṣṭom and the New Moon sacrifices.
1.2.4	And the Agniya rite should always be performed first. When the rice is being divided after the Avahanana, those that are divided first are the Agniya. After the Avahanana the Agniya is performed first, not in vain.
1.2.6	The pestle, mortar and winnowing basket should be washed with the mantra "Whatever is black". The washed articles should be placed on the skin. The sacrificer should throw the prepared grains into the mortar and pound them. The Havishkrit (one who prepares the oblation) releases his speech three times with the mantra "O Havishkrit, come!" The washing of the mortar and other articles is done with the mantra "What you are black". The term "washed" refers to the purified substance. The statement "placing on the skin" indicates the connection of the ritual with the purification of the oblation on the skin. The term "grains" is for the purpose of understanding the oblation of the Darsha-Paurnamasa sacrifices. The term "nirvapa" is for the understanding of all oblations. From the statement "One should lie down behind the fire silently" onwards, the Havishkrit is like a canopy. The Havishkrit comes because he is the performer of the Havishkrita rite. The term "Havishkrita" refers to the offering into the filter. The pounding is done by the Havishkritas. The statement "having pounded" indicates that the action is performed by the same agent.
1.2.5	He sprinkles the rice-grains placed on the skin with the Pavitra-water, saying, "I sprinkle thee for Agni, for thy liking." "I sprinkle thee, for Agni and Soma, for thy liking," is the example. In cases of indistinct injunctions, the sprinkling is done without any mantra, as in the case of the offering of the rice-grains. The sprinkling is done according to the rules laid down in the Nirvapa-mantra, just as the washing of the hands is done according to rules laid down in a mantra.
1.2.7	Having carried (the rice) and having made the husks and chaff fall off, having washed the rice with water, he places the rice-cake on the fire, saying, "Rice-cake to Agni." The taking of the rice-cake is to prevent the new potsherds and skull-bones from being offered together, because of their being together.
1.2.8	By this verse he sprinkles (the rice). By the transference of the context, the sprinkling of rice along with the mantra takes place. The taking of water is to prevent it from being milk.
1.2.9	Immediately after the sprinkling of water, he pours the rice. The taking of rice is to prevent it being cooked with sesamum. Since there is a difference in time in all cases, the taking of rice is the water and the rice in it.
1.2.10	And with this (verse) he thrice turns the rice around the fire. The verse is recited only once, because of the necessity of turning the rice three times, for the purpose of turning away from the three quarters.
1.2.11	The turning of the rice with the verse is done with the face towards the east. The turning means shaking. The rice is shaken and turned around. The turning is done without looking at it. The word 'right' is used for the purpose of regulating as one pleases.
1.2.6	The pestle, mortar and winnowing basket should be washed with the mantra "Whatever is black". The washed articles should be placed on the skin. The sacrificer should throw the prepared grains into the mortar and pound them. The Havishkrit (one who prepares the oblation) releases his speech three times with the mantra "O Havishkrit, come!" The washing of the mortar and other articles is done with the mantra "What you are black". The term "washed" refers to the purified substance. The statement "placing on the skin" indicates the connection of the ritual with the purification of the oblation on the skin.

The term "Havishkrita" refers to the offering into the filter. The pounding is done by the Havishkritas. The statement "having pounded" indicates that the action is performed by the same agent.
1.2.12	Henceforth, whether it is with or without striking, whether it is clockwise or counterclockwise.
1.2.13	Having taken up, he places the kindling wood there.
1.2.14	To the north of the kindling wood.
1.2.15	The text "he sprinkles" is a continuation of the sentence, because of the statement "Thus the rites are indicated by the words".
1.2.7	Having carried (the rice) and having made the husks and chaff fall off, having washed the rice with water, he places the rice-cake on the fire, saying, "Rice-cake to Agni." The taking of the rice-cake is to prevent the new potsherds and skull-bones from being offered together, because of their being together.
1.2.8	By this verse he sprinkles (the rice). By the transference of the context, the sprinkling of rice along with the mantra takes place. The taking of water is to prevent it from being milk.
1.2.9	Immediately after the sprinkling of water, he pours the rice. The taking of rice is to prevent it being cooked with sesamum. Since there is a difference in time in all cases, the taking of rice is the water and the rice in it.
1.2.10	And with this (verse) he thrice turns the rice around the fire. The verse is recited only once, because of the necessity of turning the rice three times, for the purpose of turning away from the three quarters.
1.2.11	The turning of the rice with the verse is done with the face towards the east. The turning means shaking. The rice is shaken and turned around. The turning is done without looking at it. The word 'right' is used for the purpose of regulating as one pleases.
1.2.16	He sprinkles the sacrificial grass with the formula, "I sprinkle thee for the satisfaction of Pṛthivī." The taking of the sacrificial grass and the kindling wood is for the purpose of sprinkling both of them. The entire formula is to be recited. The taking of the kindling wood and the sacrificial grass is for the purpose sprinkling both of them.
1.2.12	Henceforth, whether it is with or without striking, whether it is clockwise or counterclockwise.
1.2.13	Having taken up, he places the kindling wood there.
1.2.14	To the north of the kindling wood.
1.2.15	The text "he sprinkles" is a continuation of the sentence, because of the statement "Thus the rites are indicated by the words".
1.2.17	The first handful of grass that is cut, he places in front of the fire with the tip towards the east. The mention of the first handful of grass separately at the time of cutting is due to the cessation of the injunction. The mention at the time of the cutting is due to its necessity here. The mention of ghee in the section on ghee is due to the absence of mention elsewhere.
1.2.18	After taking the Darbha grass from the Paribhojanīya (grass), one should place the Darbha grass around the sacrificial fire. The Veda says, "The altar is the sacrifice." The seat of the Brahman is called Brahmasana. Here there is the Brahmanvarana (covering) and the Vritajapas (recitation while covered). The Veda says, "One recites while covered." It is like a canopy. One says, "I am the lord of the earth."
1.2.19	Having begun from the middle of the northern Veda, he goes around covering it all around. He goes around covering it, going along the southern side of the fire as far as the western half of the Veda.
1.2.16	He sprinkles the sacrificial grass with the formula, "I sprinkle thee for the satisfaction of Pṛthivī." The taking of the sacrificial grass and the kindling wood is for the purpose of sprinkling both of them. The entire formula is to be recited. The taking of the kindling wood and the sacrificial grass is for the purpose sprinkling both of them.
1.2.20	The Brahman instructs the performer to spread the Prastara first. The instruction to spread again is for the purpose of spreading the other half. Otherwise, the Veda would have been spread only partially. Hence, there would have been a repetition of the act. The verse "Devasya tvā" is used here for the purpose of connecting the halves. Therefore, the instruction to spread the middle part is a general rule. Since it falls in the middle and is an instruction, only two halves are instructed to be spread. The Brahman instructs the Brahman instructs the performer. In the absence of the Brahman, the sacrificer instructs. The absence is due to ignorance or incapacity.
1.2.21	Taking a handful of grass for the purpose of spreading the altar, he spreads it with this mantra.
1.2.17	The first handful of grass that is cut, he places in front of the fire with the tip towards the east. The mention of the first handful of grass separately at the time of cutting is due to the cessation of the injunction. The mention at the time of the cutting is due to its necessity here. The mention of ghee in the section on ghee is due to the absence of mention elsewhere.
1.2.18	After taking the Darbha grass from the Paribhojanīya (grass), one should place the Darbha grass around the sacrificial fire. The Veda says, "The altar is the sacrifice."

It is like a canopy. One says, "I am the lord of the earth."
1.2.22	As the sending forth etc. up to the spreading of the grass is done in the southern half of the altar, so it should be done in the northern half of the altar also. Thus, since there is a general statement without any specification, it means that as many handfuls are offered in the southern half, so many should be offered in the northern half. The use of the word "yuga" in the Uttara-adhyaya is for the purpose of understanding oneness elsewhere. Therefore, in the Ajyatantratantra, the sending forth is done only once, and everything else is done as per the original.
1.2.23	The place where the covering is joined should be placed on the right side above the left.
1.2.19	Having begun from the middle of the northern Veda, he goes around covering it all around. He goes around covering it, going along the southern side of the fire as far as the western half of the Veda.
1.2.24	The sprinkling is mentioned in the context of spreading the grass on both sides. The sprinkling would be as it is. There is no connection with the spreading of the grass. Although the sprinkling is mentioned in this way, there would be no sprinkling due to the absence of mantras in the Anārabhyavāda. How could there be sprinkling without mantras? It is said that the absence of mantra is due to repetition and like the fist.
1.2.20	The Brahman instructs the performer to spread the Prastara first. The instruction to spread again is for the purpose of spreading the other half. Otherwise, the Veda would have been spread only partially. Hence, there would have been a repetition of the act. The verse "Devasya tvā" is used here for the purpose of connecting the halves. Therefore, the instruction to spread the middle part is a general rule. Since it falls in the middle and is an instruction, only two halves are instructed to be spread. The Brahman instructs the Brahman instructs the performer. In the absence of the Brahman, the sacrificer instructs. The absence is due to ignorance or incapacity.
1.2.21	Taking a handful of grass for the purpose of spreading the altar, he spreads it with this mantra.
1.2.25	The grass spread on the altar, if not sprinkled, does not attain the requisite condition. The injunction of all the purposes is here. Let there be no sprinkling of the grass spread on the sacrificial ground. The text is "Having spread the Darbha grass behind the fire" and "Having spread the seat of light".
1.2.26	The grass, if not sprinkled with water, would not attain the requisite state.
1.2.22	As the sending forth etc. up to the spreading of the grass is done in the southern half of the altar, so it should be done in the northern half of the altar also. Thus, since there is a general statement without any specification, it means that as many handfuls are offered in the southern half, so many should be offered in the northern half. The use of the word "yuga" in the Uttara-adhyaya is for the purpose of understanding oneness elsewhere. Therefore, in the Ajyatantratantra, the sending forth is done only once, and everything else is done as per the original.
1.2.23	The place where the covering is joined should be placed on the right side above the left.
1.2.27	The Utpāvana (the ceremony of planting) is performed with the Pavitras (blades of Kusa grass) at the Vaishvadev (ceremony), the Madhuparka (ceremony of offering honey and curds), the Vratapatant (ceremony of the end of the vow), and the Adbhuta (ceremony of propitiating the gods in case of an unusual event).
1.2.28	The Daryudayuvana (the ceremony of giving away the Daryu) is performed with black antelope skin and other things.
1.2.29	Then, when the things are dried after washing them, he places them there. This is for the purpose of understanding the sequence of events. Since it is established here by mere presence,
1.2.30	The ladle is well known as the vessel in which the oblations are poured. The vessel in which the clarified butter is kept is called the "ajyadhani". After the spreading of these two, the other oblations should be placed.
1.2.24	The sprinkling is mentioned in the context of spreading the grass on both sides. The sprinkling would be as it is. There is no connection with the spreading of the grass. Although the sprinkling is mentioned in this way, there would be no sprinkling due to the absence of mantras in the Anārabhyavāda. How could there be sprinkling without mantras? It is said that the absence of mantra is due to repetition and like the fist.
1.2.31	The melted, purified, and free from hair and insects ghee is called "vīlīna pūta ghṛtam". Having taken it, placed it on the fire, and heated it with a hot stone, he places it behind the fire with the northern end facing upwards, and pours it into the vessel with the two Pavitras.
1.2.32	Thus he pours it first with this mantra.
1.2.33	This is the second.
1.2.25	The grass spread on the altar, if not sprinkled, does not attain the requisite condition. The injunction of all the purposes is here. Let there be no sprinkling of the grass spread on the sacrificial ground. The text is "Having spread the Darbha grass behind the fire" and "Having spread the seat of light".
1.2.26	The grass, if not sprinkled with water, would not attain the requisite state.
1.2.35	The word "ajya" is used in the sense of a particular kind of substance, because it is said in the text "having taken the ajya". Hence, even in the absence of the injunctions, there is the sanctification. The third injunction is for the purpose of sanctifying the ajya by the two previous mantras. The fourth injunction being for the purpose of establishing the number three, the third injunction is for establishing the connection of the parts of the mantra with the action. The sanctification of the ajya is at the time of placing the vessel containing the ajya and the oblations, because there is no pouring of the melted substance. Here, the injunction of the sanctification before the offering is for the purpose
1.2.36	When the oblation is known to be cooked, then he pours it with this Mantra. The taking of the oblation is for the purpose of excluding the clarified butter.
1.2.37	Having poured it, he brings it to the northern direction, for the purpose of conveying the oblation to the northern direction.
1.2.30	The ladle is well known as the vessel in which the oblations are poured. The vessel in which the clarified butter is kept is called the "ajyadhani". After the spreading of these two, the other oblations should be placed.
1.2.38	He places the cooked rice in the western part of the vessel of clarified butter. The sprinkling of clarified butter is done with the ladle. The sprinkling of the cooked rice is done with the same ladle. He sprinkles with the ladle having the tips pointing upwards, beginning with the verse "With the ladle having the tip pointing upwards" and ending with the verse "Silently the fourth". The connection is with the same ladle because the clarified butter is unchanged. This is the end of the rite of offering the oblation, because of the application of the same procedure.
1.2.31	The melted, purified, and free from hair and insects ghee is called "vīlīna pūta ghṛtam". Having taken it, placed it on the fire, and heated it with a hot stone, he places it behind the fire with the northern end facing upwards, and pours it into the vessel with the two Pavitras.
1.2.32	Thus he pours it first with this mantra.
1.2.33	This is the second.
1.2.39	Because the subsequent injunctions are not obstructed by the mantra, the repetition of the oblations is due to the difference of substances.
1.2.40	The meaning of the verse "One who rises sees" is that it is for the purpose of the three injunctions, because there is no other action.
1.2.35	The word "ajya" is used in the sense of a particular kind of substance, because it is said in the text "having taken the ajya". Hence, even in the absence of the injunctions, there is the sanctification. The third injunction is for the purpose of sanctifying the ajya by the two previous mantras. The fourth injunction being for the purpose of establishing the number three, the third injunction is for establishing the connection of the parts of the mantra with the action. The sanctification of the ajya is at the time of placing the vessel containing the ajya and the oblations, because there is no pouring of the melted substance. Here, the injunction of the sanctification before the offering is for the purpose
1.3.1	The third case is used because it is an injunction. The fourth and fifth cases are optional. The use of the word "iti" is only for these two cases, so that the option would be between them. The fifth case is used in the form "yunajmi tvā". After the installation of the fire, it is the same. Since the substance is mentioned, it is called "savapākayajniya". The use of the particle "atha" indicates that the kindling wood is to be placed in the middle. The statement "upasamadādhāti" is for the purpose of stopping all injunctions and optional rites. This is the second chapter composed by Bhatta Dārila, the great scholar of the Vedas, the grandson of the teacher Vatsaśarman.
1.2.36	When the oblation is known to be cooked, then he pours it with this Mantra. The taking of the oblation is for the purpose of excluding the clarified butter.
1.2.37	Having poured it, he brings it to the northern direction, for the purpose of conveying the oblation to the northern direction.
1.3.2	Since the placing of the Kalpaja vessel is done silently, as per the statement "placing the vessel silently", the mention of the Jangamayana is for the purpose of convention. This rule does not apply to the inner (ritual).
1.3.3	With two Kalpaja vessels, then "placing the water vessel and offering clarified butter by sprinkling", there the placing is up to sprinkling. It should be like this.
1.2.38	He places the cooked rice in the western part of the vessel of clarified butter. The sprinkling of clarified butter is done with the ladle. The sprinkling of the cooked rice is done with the same ladle. He sprinkles with the ladle having the tips pointing upwards, beginning with the verse "With the ladle having the tip pointing upwards" and ending with the verse "Silently the fourth". The connection is with the same ladle because the clarified butter is unchanged. This is the end of the rite of offering the oblation, because of the application of the same procedure.
1.3.4	The five oblations of the Kalpa are offered to Agni. The connection of this mantra is established by the statement of the rite in the mantra itself. The statement "The living beings" is repeated four times, and the oblations are consumed once. The statement "Let the performer and Brahma rise up" is for the understanding of the mantra. The statement "With the nine Sāman chants" means "with the tenth one for longevity". The rising up is done with the repetition of the words. The repetition is the distinction.
1.2.39	Because the subsequent injunctions are not obstructed by the mantra, the repetition of the oblations is due to the difference of substances.
1.2.40	The meaning of the verse "One who rises sees" is that it is for the purpose of the three injunctions, because there is no other action.
1.3.5	The performer of the sacrifice, without reciting any mantra, examines the seat of the Brahman. Or the performer of the sacrifice examines the seat belonging to the Brahman. The seat is examined while it is spread. In this way, the sacrifice can be performed comfortably. And in the text, "Having placed the fire on the ground, having placed the long-handled ladle, having placed the pot-cooked rice, having placed the seats of both the Brahman and the performer of the rite," the mention of the long-handled vessel indicates the removal of the fire. Therefore, the seat of the Brahmana is mentioned as such.
1.3.6	Taking grass from the seat, he throws it to the right with his left hand.
1.3.7	Thus, because of the connection with the Brahma seat, it is called "Kalapaja".
1.3.1	The third case is used because it is an injunction. The fourth and fifth cases are optional. The use of the word "iti" is only for these two cases, so that the option would be between them. The fifth case is used in the form "yunajmi tvā". After the installation of the fire, it is the same. Since the substance is mentioned, it is called "savapākayajniya". The use of the particle "atha" indicates that the kindling wood is to be placed in the middle. The statement "upasamadādhāti" is for the purpose of stopping all injunctions and optional rites. This is the second chapter composed by Bhatta Dārila, the great scholar of the Vedas, the grandson of the teacher Vatsaśarman.
1.3.8	The statement of the Brahma-mantra is made for the purpose of the special meaning of Brahma, even though Brahma may not be present. Or, the statement of the Brahma mantra is for the purpose of obtaining the Brahma mantra in the Indra-mantra.
1.3.2	Since the placing of the Kalpaja vessel is done silently, as per the statement "placing the vessel silently", the mention of the Jangamayana is for the purpose of convention. This rule does not apply to the inner (ritual).
1.3.3	With two Kalpaja vessels, then "placing the water vessel and offering clarified butter by sprinkling", there the placing is up to sprinkling. It should be like this.
1.3.9	Having well purified the two Darbha-blades used for eating, the Hotṛ, taking up the spoon with its tip pointing upwards, recites the mantra for heating it. Having taken the root, he recites the mantra. The Hotṛ, taking the spoon, recites the following mantra: "May there be no confusion between the taking of the spoon and the scraping of the ladle." The scraping and other acts are implied by the context.
1.3.4	The five oblations of the Kalpa are offered to Agni. The connection of this mantra is established by the statement of the rite in the mantra itself. The statement "The living beings" is repeated four times, and the oblations are consumed once. The statement "Let the performer and Brahma rise up" is for the understanding of the mantra. The statement "With the nine Sāman chants" means "with the tenth one for longevity". The rising up is done with the repetition of the words. The repetition is the distinction.
1.3.10	Having taken up the clarified butter sanctified with the ladle, he raises it with the verse, "What is in the vessel of clarified butter..." because of the indication of recognition. The first statement is for the purpose of distinction. The statement "grahas" means "grahas and the share of clarified butter". Having taken up the grahas means having taken up the grahs in the Nakṣatra-kalpa.
1.3.11	It has been explained as before.
1.3.5	The performer of the sacrifice, without reciting any mantra, examines the seat of the Brahman. Or the performer of the sacrifice examines the seat belonging to the Brahman. The seat is examined while it is spread. In this way, the sacrifice can be performed comfortably. And in the text, "Having placed the fire on the ground, having placed the long-handled ladle, having placed the pot-cooked rice, having placed the seats of both the Brahman and the performer of the rite," the mention of the long-handled vessel indicates the removal of the fire. Therefore, the seat of the Brahmana is mentioned as such.
1.3.6	Taking grass from the seat, he throws it to the right with his left hand.
1.3.7	Thus, because of the connection with the Brahma seat, it is called "Kalapaja".
1.3.12-13	The pouring of the oblations is to be done as before. After the offering of the oblations, there is no taking up of four spoonfuls, because there is no mention of it. Nor is there the offering of seven spoonfuls for the purpose of the offering before. In the Pitryajna, the offering before is taken up, because there is a mention of the taking up of the Grahas. Therefore, the taking up of four is for all purposes. The pouring back is also for the purpose of nourishing, because of the presence of the word 'avadyati'. The statement 'One pours back what is in the vessel of clarified butter' indicates that it is for the purpose of nourishment. Our great-grandfather Vatsasharman says that one pours back the oblation. The statement 'One offers from where one pours back' indicates that it serves the purpose of nourishing.
1.3.8	The statement of the Brahma-mantra is made for the purpose of the special meaning of Brahma, even though Brahma may not be present. Or, the statement of the Brahma mantra is for the purpose of obtaining the Brahma mantra in the Indra-mantra.
1.3.14	The rites of the king are concluded with the words "The terrors of the east" and the rites of sorcery with the words "Surrounded on both sides". There are five mantras for the planets in these rites: "I take thee for the life, for the breath, for the circulation, for the equal, for the upward movement of Rajyavardhana." The fifth is "For him." The name of the enemy is to be added. The use of the fifth case in both places is for the purpose of taking each mantra separately.
1.3.9	Having well purified the two Darbha-blades used for eating, the Hotṛ, taking up the spoon with its tip pointing upwards, recites the mantra for heating it. Having taken the root, he recites the mantra. The Hotṛ, taking the spoon, recites the following mantra: "May there be no confusion between the taking of the spoon and the scraping of the ladle." The scraping and other acts are implied by the context.
1.3.15	Because each of them is a ritual act, he offers the clarified butter from the vessel of clarified butter into the fire with each of these mantras and with each ladle.
1.3.16	The term "samanta" is used for the purpose of convention. The plural form in "samanta, samvidhāna, samṛddhi, and śānti" is used for each verse for the purpose of distinguishing the acts.
1.3.10	Having taken up the clarified butter sanctified with the ladle, he raises it with the verse, "What is in the vessel of clarified butter..." because of the indication of recognition. The first statement is for the purpose of distinction. The statement "grahas" means "grahas and the share of clarified butter". Having taken up the grahas means having taken up the grahs in the Nakṣatra-kalpa.
1.3.11	It has been explained as before.
1.3.17	In the southern direction of the fire, not far away, is a vessel of water. There he brings the drops of ghee offerings. The statement "to the south of the fire, a vessel of water" is for the purpose of understanding the nearest vessel of water when there are many vessels of water. The statement "the southern direction of the Agni" is for the sake of understanding the southern direction of Agni. The statement "a vessel of water" has been determined for the purpose of addressing. The drops are the remaining oblations. Bringing them is said for whom?
1.3.12-13	The pouring of the oblations is to be done as before. After the offering of the oblations, there is no taking up of four spoonfuls, because there is no mention of it. Nor is there the offering of seven spoonfuls for the purpose of the offering before. In the Pitryajna, the offering before is taken up, because there is a mention of the taking up of the Grahas. Therefore, the taking up of four is for all purposes. The pouring back is also for the purpose of nourishing, because of the presence of the word 'avadyati'. The statement 'One pours back what is in the vessel of clarified butter' indicates that it is for the purpose of nourishment. Our great-grandfather Vatsasharman says that one pours back the oblation. The statement 'One offers from where one pours back' indicates that it serves the purpose of nourishing.
1.3.14	The rites of the king are concluded with the words "The terrors of the east" and the rites of sorcery with the words "Surrounded on both sides". There are five mantras for the planets in these rites: "I take thee for the life, for the breath, for the circulation, for the equal, for the upward movement of Rajyavardhana." The fifth is "For him." The name of the enemy is to be added. The use of the fifth case in both places is for the purpose of taking each mantra separately.
1.3.15	Because each of them is a ritual act, he offers the clarified butter from the vessel of clarified butter into the fire with each of these mantras and with each ladle.
1.3.16	The term "samanta" is used for the purpose of convention. The plural form in "samanta, samvidhāna, samṛddhi, and śānti" is used for each verse for the purpose of distinguishing the acts.
1.3.18	The offering of these oblations is for peaceful purposes, not for the purpose of harming others. The oblations are offered with the verses, "Agni in Agni, purified by the heart," "To Agni, the great," and "What today I offer to you with effort." The oblations are concluded with the verse, "To Akriti." The offering of these additional oblations is for prosperity. The offering of oblations of ghee in a vessel of water is for the purpose of understanding that the oblations are of ghee, even though the text mentions "oblations." The verse, "The binding of the Aśvas, the bathing, the conveyance, and the food are accompanied by oblations," and the verse, "All are to be recited with mantras," indicate the sequence of the oblations for prosperity. The qualification "peaceful" is for the purpose that they are to be performed here together with the oblations. The prosperity oblations are not to be performed in the context of cooking. The oblations offered before the cooking are not to be offered in the context of oblations. The oblations for peaceful purposes are offered with the verse, “O Agni, whatever heat is yours,” “Thus it is, O Agni,” and “Drive him away, remove him.” These are the oblations for harming others. Alternatively, the mention of oblations of clarified butter is for the purpose understanding that the oblatioins offered before the cooking, etc., are of clarified butter, even though the oblations are mentioned as being accompanied by oblations.
1.3.19	"The word "iti" is for the purpose of indicating the peacefulness. The meaning is "these two are peaceful". These two are peaceful by themselves. By the general rule, even the Homa-offerings at the beginning and at the end of the sacrifice are peaceful by themselves." The taking of the Ajya-portion is for the sake of convention. Here are the Sampāta-offerings.
1.3.17	In the southern direction of the fire, not far away, is a vessel of water. There he brings the drops of ghee offerings. The statement "to the south of the fire, a vessel of water" is for the purpose of understanding the nearest vessel of water when there are many vessels of water. The statement "the southern direction of the Agni" is for the sake of understanding the southern direction of Agni. The statement "a vessel of water" has been determined for the purpose of addressing. The drops are the remaining oblations. Bringing them is said for whom?
1.4.1	Thus, in the northeast corner of the altar, one offers clarified butter to Agni. The mention of the deity along with the name is for the purpose of establishing the location of the corner in this region, because of the similarity of the deity, and also for the purpose of accomplishing the exception mentioned in the statement "The northern portion of the offering to Agni".
1.4.2	"To Soma" is like "to Agni".
1.4.3	The principal offering is made between the two portions of clarified butter offered before and after the oblation. This is because of the authority of the text. And the offering of the two portions of butter is not necessary, because of the text, "The oblation together with the offerings before and after." How is the oblation to be offered?
1.4.4	Having placed clarified butter in the ladle, he takes up the ladleful of clarified butter with the two middle fingers joined together, and cuts the oblation twice from the middle of the oblation, from the eastern half of the middle. The connection of the oblation with the oblation to be offered is by the word 'pavitra' (purifier). Thus it is said, 'From where he offers, he offers.'
1.4.5	"From where he pours twice, that is the order. Having taken the twice-poured ladle of clarified butter in another vessel, he pours over it. From where, from which place, he pours twice, he pours over that oblation. The meaning is that he nourishes it back. The taking of the oblation is as before. The pouring over in order is being stated here."
1.3.18	The offering of these oblations is for peaceful purposes, not for the purpose of harming others. The oblations are offered with the verses, "Agni in Agni, purified by the heart," "To Agni, the great," and "What today I offer to you with effort." The oblations are concluded with the verse, "To Akriti." The offering of these additional oblations is for prosperity. The offering of oblations of ghee in a vessel of water is for the purpose of understanding that the oblations are of ghee, even though the text mentions "oblations." The verse, "The binding of the Aśvas, the bathing, the conveyance, and the food are accompanied by oblations," and the verse, "All are to be recited with mantras," indicate the sequence of the oblations for prosperity. The qualification "peaceful" is for the purpose that they are to be performed here together with the oblations. The prosperity oblations are not to be performed in the context of cooking. The oblations offered before the cooking are not to be offered in the context of oblations. The oblations for peaceful purposes are offered with the verse, “O Agni, whatever heat is yours,” “Thus it is, O Agni,” and “Drive him away, remove him.” These are the oblations for harming others. Alternatively, the mention of oblations of clarified butter is for the purpose understanding that the oblatioins offered before the cooking, etc., are of clarified butter, even though the oblations are mentioned as being accompanied by oblations.
1.4.6	Because it is broken off in that way, he pours the oblation in that order. Or it should be said in order. Because of the lightness, it would be only the principal oblation and not the subsidiary oblation. It is not of clarified butter. It is said thus for that purpose.
1.3.19	"The word "iti" is for the purpose of indicating the peacefulness. The meaning is "these two are peaceful". These two are peaceful by themselves. By the general rule, even the Homa-offerings at the beginning and at the end of the sacrifice are peaceful by themselves." The taking of the Ajya-portion is for the sake of convention. Here are the Sampāta-offerings.
1.4.1	Thus, in the northeast corner of the altar, one offers clarified butter to Agni. The mention of the deity along with the name is for the purpose of establishing the location of the corner in this region, because of the similarity of the deity, and also for the purpose of accomplishing the exception mentioned in the statement "The northern portion of the offering to Agni".
1.4.2	"To Soma" is like "to Agni".
1.4.3	The principal offering is made between the two portions of clarified butter offered before and after the oblation. This is because of the authority of the text. And the offering of the two portions of butter is not necessary, because of the text, "The oblation together with the offerings before and after." How is the oblation to be offered?
1.4.7	The Avadanas are to be performed separately, as stated in the text, because of the separate mention of the Homa. It has been said that all the rites are to be performed. The author says: "In the connection of rites, there is an option of words." If one were to be performed, there would be an option of the Rigveda. "The Homas are to be performed with Svāhā-ending separately for each verse." Why is there a separate mention of the Homas? It may be for the purpose of stopping the recitation of the entire Sūkta. The Homa should not be performed with the entire Sūktam. This is not so because the entire Sūktā is not prescribed anywhere. Therefore, the Homas are to performed separately. Because of the mention of conjunction, the prescription of all Avadānas is for the connection of many with one principal. In the Aṣṭakā, the Avadāna is to be performed twice for each oblation. And one Caturghṛta is not to be offered separately for each mantra.
1.4.4	Having placed clarified butter in the ladle, he takes up the ladleful of clarified butter with the two middle fingers joined together, and cuts the oblation twice from the middle of the oblation, from the eastern half of the middle. The connection of the oblation with the oblation to be offered is by the word 'pavitra' (purifier). Thus it is said, 'From where he offers, he offers.'
1.4.8	In the case of the offering of many oblations, the pouring of the oblation is not done in the manner prescribed in the text, “Having placed the clarified butter, having taken it up once from all, he should pour it twice.” The pouring of the oblations of the deities of one deity is done separately for each deity, in order to stop the pouring. It is so because of the statement, “One Svishtakrit.”
1.4.9	He should offer the first oblation in the east, which is connected with the Homa, as per the statement "In the middle of the east, the oblation."
1.4.5	"From where he pours twice, that is the order. Having taken the twice-poured ladle of clarified butter in another vessel, he pours over it. From where, from which place, he pours twice, he pours over that oblation. The meaning is that he nourishes it back. The taking of the oblation is as before. The pouring over in order is being stated here."
1.4.6	Because it is broken off in that way, he pours the oblation in that order. Or it should be said in order. Because of the lightness, it would be only the principal oblation and not the subsidiary oblation. It is not of clarified butter. It is said thus for that purpose.
1.4.10	Thus, in the case of the Agniya offering, the first oblation is offered before the first oblation. In the case of the first oblation offered in the first place, the oblations are offered in accordance with the respective verses. When the offering is offered again and again, the word "offering" is used for all purposes. Therefore, in the case where there is no modification, such as in the case of Aṣṭakā, this is the same.
1.4.7	The Avadanas are to be performed separately, as stated in the text, because of the separate mention of the Homa. It has been said that all the rites are to be performed. The author says: "In the connection of rites, there is an option of words." If one were to be performed, there would be an option of the Rigveda. "The Homas are to be performed with Svāhā-ending separately for each verse." Why is there a separate mention of the Homas? It may be for the purpose of stopping the recitation of the entire Sūkta. The Homa should not be performed with the entire Sūktam. This is not so because the entire Sūktā is not prescribed anywhere. Therefore, the Homas are to performed separately. Because of the mention of conjunction, the prescription of all Avadānas is for the connection of many with one principal. In the Aṣṭakā, the Avadāna is to be performed twice for each oblation. And one Caturghṛta is not to be offered separately for each mantra.
1.4.11	The Homa-offerings are to be made with the Rk-verses, as it is said, "The Rk-verses are to be recited in the order in which they occur." The Homa-offersings that are enjoined in some places are to be made by each Rk-verse. Therefore, the Homa-offerrings are to be made separately by each Rk, because the statement of the Rk-verse is not intended to be connected with the Homa-offering. And in the case of the Yajati-offerings, the Homa is to be performed first. In both cases, the Homa offerings are to be made at the end of each Rk-verses. The statement of the deity is to be taken as applying to all cases, because the deity is not mentioned in the Ajyabhaga and the Svistakrt offering. The deity is not mentioned because it is understood by the method of what is stated and what is not stated. Or, it is not so because in the second Ajyabhaga, the statement is "Svāhā to Soma" and in the Nirvapa, the deity is conceived as being for the sake of the deity. The statement of "end" is for the purpose of connecting with the Svaras at the end of the Rk.
1.4.8	In the case of the offering of many oblations, the pouring of the oblation is not done in the manner prescribed in the text, “Having placed the clarified butter, having taken it up once from all, he should pour it twice.” The pouring of the oblations of the deities of one deity is done separately for each deity, in order to stop the pouring. It is so because of the statement, “One Svishtakrit.”
1.4.12	The offering is made from the Soma-portion, which is gentle. The Pitrs partake of it.
1.4.13	Since there is a fault in both, therefore the offering should be made in between. What is the good of that? It is said that it is offered in the place of the gods. The praise of the middle place is also said thus: 'In the middle, the oblation' is praised.
1.4.9	He should offer the first oblation in the east, which is connected with the Homa, as per the statement "In the middle of the east, the oblation."
1.4.14	Having offered the first oblation, the oblation that is offered in the western direction is called the oblation that departs. It causes one to depart. The meaning is that it does not cause one to return to what is better. And therefore that sacrificer becomes poorer and poorer.
1.4.10	Thus, in the case of the Agniya offering, the first oblation is offered before the first oblation. In the case of the first oblation offered in the first place, the oblations are offered in accordance with the respective verses. When the offering is offered again and again, the word "offering" is used for all purposes. Therefore, in the case where there is no modification, such as in the case of Aṣṭakā, this is the same.
1.4.15	The oblation which is offered first, and which is called the "supreme of the supreme," is called the "Abhikramanti" (the advancing), because it advances towards the front. The sacrificer becomes the lord.
1.4.16	The oblation which the fire offers in an unsuitable place, or when it is not burning, or above the ashes, is called 'blind' because it does not illuminate. The sacrificer becomes blind-natured because of that.
1.4.17	The oblation which the smoke alone throws away, the sacrificer, though endowed with good qualities, becomes unilluminating.
1.4.18	The oblation which is offered in the Jyotishmati fire, by that oblation one becomes lustrous and radiant. And because this is so, therefore the Jyotishmatī oblation should be offered.
1.4.19	In the Koushika-vritti composed by Bhatta Daridra, the great-grandson of Upadhyaya Vatsasharman, the fourth chapter is concluded.
1.4.11	The Homa-offerings are to be made with the Rk-verses, as it is said, "The Rk-verses are to be recited in the order in which they occur." The Homa-offersings that are enjoined in some places are to be made by each Rk-verse. Therefore, the Homa-offerrings are to be made separately by each Rk, because the statement of the Rk-verse is not intended to be connected with the Homa-offering. And in the case of the Yajati-offerings, the Homa is to be performed first. In both cases, the Homa offerings are to be made at the end of each Rk-verses. The statement of the deity is to be taken as applying to all cases, because the deity is not mentioned in the Ajyabhaga and the Svistakrt offering. The deity is not mentioned because it is understood by the method of what is stated and what is not stated. Or, it is not so because in the second Ajyabhaga, the statement is "Svāhā to Soma" and in the Nirvapa, the deity is conceived as being for the sake of the deity. The statement of "end" is for the purpose of connecting with the Svaras at the end of the Rk.
1.4.12	The offering is made from the Soma-portion, which is gentle. The Pitrs partake of it.
1.4.13	Since there is a fault in both, therefore the offering should be made in between. What is the good of that? It is said that it is offered in the place of the gods. The praise of the middle place is also said thus: 'In the middle, the oblation' is praised.
1.4.14	Having offered the first oblation, the oblation that is offered in the western direction is called the oblation that departs. It causes one to depart. The meaning is that it does not cause one to return to what is better. And therefore that sacrificer becomes poorer and poorer.
1.4.15	The oblation which is offered first, and which is called the "supreme of the supreme," is called the "Abhikramanti" (the advancing), because it advances towards the front. The sacrificer becomes the lord.
1.5.1	Thus, just as the procedure of offering to Agni, so also the procedure of offering the oblation to Agni-Soma. When it is obtained by the general statement "Lead him upwards" in the mantra "Lead him upwards", the other mantras are mentioned. One Vedic mantra and three Kalpaja mantras are mentioned because of the similarity of procedure. The statement "Thus" refers to the specific context of the rites. Here it is said, "The offerings are made with the mantras ending with 'svāhā', one by one." Since the offering of clarified butter is indicated by the general statement, and the meaning of the statement "one should offer" is indicated, the rites have a purpose here. Why is the offering to Agni-Soma mentioned? It will be related to the deity Agni through the connection with the sign. Like the offering to Agni, the offering of oblation is mentioned for the purpose of connecting with something else. Because the first offering is not Kalpaja, the word "iti" has the purpose of indicating. The connection with Indra-Agni would be through the statement, because of the obstruction caused by the statement "iti". Therefore, the statement of the subsequent offering is for the purpose of connection with the subsequent ones. The rite is related to the deity through the connection with mantras. By what oblation? Why? Because of the purpose of the collection of mantras. The oblation is connected with all mantras. Therefore, there is a difference in rites for each mantra. And for this very reason, this is for the purpose to prevent the occurrence of rites elsewhere except for Sauviṣṭakṛt.
1.4.16	The oblation which the fire offers in an unsuitable place, or when it is not burning, or above the ashes, is called 'blind' because it does not illuminate. The sacrificer becomes blind-natured because of that.
1.4.17	The oblation which the smoke alone throws away, the sacrificer, though endowed with good qualities, becomes unilluminating.
1.5.2	By four.
1.5.3	Thus he offers the oblation of Indra-Agni. The offering to Indra-Agni is explained as the offering to Agni-Soma. The mention of the new moon is for the purpose of stopping the usage of each mantra. And hence, even in the case of the offering to Visvedevas, there would be connection with the last mantra. Therefore, the mention of the new-moon is for the purpose stopping that.
1.4.18	The oblation which is offered in the Jyotishmati fire, by that oblation one becomes lustrous and radiant. And because this is so, therefore the Jyotishmatī oblation should be offered.
1.4.19	In the Koushika-vritti composed by Bhatta Daridra, the great-grandson of Upadhyaya Vatsasharman, the fourth chapter is concluded.
1.5.1	Thus, just as the procedure of offering to Agni, so also the procedure of offering the oblation to Agni-Soma. When it is obtained by the general statement "Lead him upwards" in the mantra "Lead him upwards", the other mantras are mentioned. One Vedic mantra and three Kalpaja mantras are mentioned because of the similarity of procedure. The statement "Thus" refers to the specific context of the rites. Here it is said, "The offerings are made with the mantras ending with 'svāhā', one by one." Since the offering of clarified butter is indicated by the general statement, and the meaning of the statement "one should offer" is indicated, the rites have a purpose here. Why is the offering to Agni-Soma mentioned? It will be related to the deity Agni through the connection with the sign. Like the offering to Agni, the offering of oblation is mentioned for the purpose of connecting with something else. Because the first offering is not Kalpaja, the word "iti" has the purpose of indicating. The connection with Indra-Agni would be through the statement, because of the obstruction caused by the statement "iti". Therefore, the statement of the subsequent offering is for the purpose of connection with the subsequent ones. The rite is related to the deity through the connection with mantras. By what oblation? Why? Because of the purpose of the collection of mantras. The oblation is connected with all mantras. Therefore, there is a difference in rites for each mantra. And for this very reason, this is for the purpose to prevent the occurrence of rites elsewhere except for Sauviṣṭakṛt.
1.5.4	The Svishtakrit, which is enjoined in the text, "Having taken up all the portions of the oblations one by one, etc." and the two oblations called "Purnas" are the oblations of prosperity. The five oblations beginning with "For Akriti thee" are optional. The oblation called "Pratisthita" is the oblation of prosperity for the peaceful ones. And since the order of the Parvan and other oblations is established by the order of the text, the statement "before the Svishtakrit" is meaningless. When the oblation is half of the Svishtakrt, then the oblation of ghee is again offered in the rites of obtaining the Svishtakṛt, either from the principal oblation or from the remnant. Because of the status of being a remnant, the Svishtakrti is prescribed even in the ghee-oblation-series. And the two oblations of the Parvan are meant to be combined in the ghee-series itself. Or, according to the statement "The rites before the Svishtakriti are completed with the oblation of the ghee, and the Svishtakruti is performed afterwards", there would be a restriction on the order of the rites of the Parvan, etc. in the oblations of ghee and in the rites where the injunction is not clear. But this is meant to be optional here. Or, it is meant to stop the rites of the parvan, etc. when they are combined with the Anumati. Or, it means that the rites of the Purnima, etc. are obtained in the Vikriti. Because there would be no combination due to the connection with time, and the name of the deity is mentioned in the Vikriti.
1.5.5	The mantra for the Parvanhoma sacrifice.
1.5.2	By four.
1.5.3	Thus he offers the oblation of Indra-Agni. The offering to Indra-Agni is explained as the offering to Agni-Soma. The mention of the new moon is for the purpose of stopping the usage of each mantra. And hence, even in the case of the offering to Visvedevas, there would be connection with the last mantra. Therefore, the mention of the new-moon is for the purpose stopping that.
1.5.6	Each of them is both. Because of the absence of a rule, this is a rule for the alternation of the Darsha-Paurnamasa sacrifices. Because of the mention of Homa, there is the inclusion of the Ajya-Havi. And in the case of the alternation of the Parvan sacrifices, it is due to the proximity of time. In other times, the Purnima comes after. In the case of the Adhvara sacrifices, there is no restriction because of the mention of the performance of the rites in the first half. And in the cases of the auspicious rites, there would be the occurrence of other causes. And in the medicinal rites, there would not be any cause. In the cases of the rites with explicit injunctions, there is the determination of the deity due to the indication of the deity. The deity is the cause of the mention of Dharma. In the cases where there is the mention of the rites in other directions, such as "One performs the auspicious rites in the north", and in the cases of military rites, there is the connection with the time of the expedition. The prosperity rites are mentioned. "To Akriti, Svāhā" is said in the first prosperity rite. "To Kama, Svāhā” is said in the second prosperity rite. In the third prosperity rite, there is the mention that "To prosperity, Svāhā". In the cases of auspicious rites, there is no rule because of the mention as in the case of Adhvara. And in the auspicious rites, the occurrence of other auspicious causes. In the prosperity rites.
1.5.7	Thus, in the fifth (chapter), since the offering is made with ghee, the offerings are made in the prosperity rites.
1.5.4	The Svishtakrit, which is enjoined in the text, "Having taken up all the portions of the oblations one by one, etc." and the two oblations called "Purnas" are the oblations of prosperity. The five oblations beginning with "For Akriti thee" are optional. The oblation called "Pratisthita" is the oblation of prosperity for the peaceful ones. And since the order of the Parvan and other oblations is established by the order of the text, the statement "before the Svishtakrit" is meaningless. When the oblation is half of the Svishtakrt, then the oblation of ghee is again offered in the rites of obtaining the Svishtakṛt, either from the principal oblation or from the remnant. Because of the status of being a remnant, the Svishtakrti is prescribed even in the ghee-oblation-series. And the two oblations of the Parvan are meant to be combined in the ghee-series itself. Or, according to the statement "The rites before the Svishtakriti are completed with the oblation of the ghee, and the Svishtakruti is performed afterwards", there would be a restriction on the order of the rites of the Parvan, etc. in the oblations of ghee and in the rites where the injunction is not clear. But this is meant to be optional here. Or, it is meant to stop the rites of the parvan, etc. when they are combined with the Anumati. Or, it means that the rites of the Purnima, etc. are obtained in the Vikriti. Because there would be no combination due to the connection with time, and the name of the deity is mentioned in the Vikriti.
1.5.5	The mantra for the Parvanhoma sacrifice.
1.5.8	By these offerings to Prajapati, one should offer with the verse, "None other than you." Now, what was said, "The offerings for prosperity and the optional ones," which are those optional ones? It is said that the offerings to Prajapatih are optional due to the connection with the sequence, the indication of that, and the use of the word "and" twice, both are optional. One should offer clarified butter with the offerings to Prajapathi, because there are many verses in the offerings to Prajapaiti, due to the indication of that and the understanding of the offering, and due to the use of the particle "iti" in the verses for the offerings to Prajatapaiti.
1.5.9	Now, what is meant by the northern direction? It means the northern direction. Here the sixth case-ending is used to specify the direction. The connection of all the oblations with the northern direction is meant to be singular. The connection of the oblations is meant to be with the northern direction. The prohibition in the text, "Do not offer the oblations" indicates that the connection is with each oblation. The offering is meant to be done once with each oblation, and the offering is meant to take place with the ladle. Having poured twice, he pours over the ladle-full that has been poured twice, so that the pouring may be done twice over the entire ladle-full. It is not meant to be poured back.
1.5.10	When the text says, “From whatever side one pours,” it is meant that the oblations should be poured from all sides. But the text, “Not the oblations,” prohibits this. Since the oblations are connected with all the rites, they should be poured once only, as in the case of the single oblation, because of the common place of all the rites.
1.5.6	Each of them is both. Because of the absence of a rule, this is a rule for the alternation of the Darsha-Paurnamasa sacrifices. Because of the mention of Homa, there is the inclusion of the Ajya-Havi. And in the case of the alternation of the Parvan sacrifices, it is due to the proximity of time. In other times, the Purnima comes after. In the case of the Adhvara sacrifices, there is no restriction because of the mention of the performance of the rites in the first half. And in the cases of the auspicious rites, there would be the occurrence of other causes. And in the medicinal rites, there would not be any cause. In the cases of the rites with explicit injunctions, there is the determination of the deity due to the indication of the deity. The deity is the cause of the mention of Dharma. In the cases where there is the mention of the rites in other directions, such as "One performs the auspicious rites in the north", and in the cases of military rites, there is the connection with the time of the expedition.

In the third prosperity rite, there is the mention that "To prosperity, Svāhā". In the cases of auspicious rites, there is no rule because of the mention as in the case of Adhvara. And in the auspicious rites, the occurrence of other auspicious causes. In the prosperity rites.
1.5.7	Thus, in the fifth (chapter), since the offering is made with ghee, the offerings are made in the prosperity rites.
1.5.11	The Homa-mantra is to be recited up to the Devas. The mantra "Uttarasvānandam" and others are to be used in the Svishtakrit offering. Therefore, this distinction is made in the text "After the Svishtakrt offering, together with it". "Having offered separately in the northeastern corner, one offers all the expiatory Homa offerings." "Having offered separately" means having offered separately. "One offers all the expiation Homa offerings" means one offers all the Homa offerings for expiation. Even though there is a lacuna in the original text, this is done so that the injunction may be applicable. The purpose of this injunction is to rectify the transgression of mantras. In the case of transgression of human duties, it is said "May the senses return again", and "The best is all actions". Therefore, even if one is alone, one should offer the Homa. In the case where both are transgressed, there is a combination, because of the combination of both. There is a combination of both "May the senses be restored again" and "All expiatory Homas" because of the combination.
1.5.8	By these offerings to Prajapati, one should offer with the verse, "None other than you." Now, what was said, "The offerings for prosperity and the optional ones," which are those optional ones? It is said that the offerings to Prajapatih are optional due to the connection with the sequence, the indication of that, and the use of the word "and" twice, both are optional. One should offer clarified butter with the offerings to Prajapathi, because there are many verses in the offerings to Prajapaiti, due to the indication of that and the understanding of the offering, and due to the use of the particle "iti" in the verses for the offerings to Prajatapaiti.
1.5.12	Thus the twelve mantras are to be employed. The statement "Whatever has been spilled by me" indicates that it is to be used in all expiations. The statement "All expiations" and the statement "Homa" indicate that ghee is to be used. Thus ends the fifth chapter.
1.5.9	Now, what is meant by the northern direction? It means the northern direction. Here the sixth case-ending is used to specify the direction. The connection of all the oblations with the northern direction is meant to be singular. The connection of the oblations is meant to be with the northern direction. The prohibition in the text, "Do not offer the oblations" indicates that the connection is with each oblation. The offering is meant to be done once with each oblation, and the offering is meant to take place with the ladle.

Even though there is a lacuna in the original text, this is done so that the injunction may be applicable. The purpose of this injunction is to rectify the transgression of mantras. In the case of transgression of human duties, it is said "May the senses return again", and "The best is all actions". Therefore, even if one is alone, one should offer the Homa. In the case where both are transgressed, there is a combination, because of the combination of both. There is a combination of both "May the senses be restored again" and "All expiatory Homas" because of the combination.
1.5.12	Thus the twelve mantras are to be employed. The statement "Whatever has been spilled by me" indicates that it is to be used in all expiations. The statement "All expiations" and the statement "Homa" indicate that ghee is to be used. Thus ends the fifth chapter.
